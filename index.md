# Mapping U.S. Supreme Court Data Across the Internet

With the [National Archives](https://www.archives.gov), [Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov), and even (*gasp*) the [U.S. Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov) itself making more of the Court's current and historical information available online, having some roadmaps to -- and mappings between -- all that data is becoming increasingly important.

Add private collections to the mix, such as [The Oyez Project](https://www.oyez.org), [Justia](https://supreme.justia.com), and [The Supreme Court Database](http://scdb.wustl.edu), and the wealth of information becomes both a blessing and a curse.

In 2023, NARA finally made the fully digitized collection of [U.S. Supreme Court audio recordings](https://unwritten-record.blogs.archives.gov/2023/05/30/oyez-oyez-oyez-sound-recordings-of-the-supreme-court-of-the-united-states-now-fully-digitized/) available -- a long-overdue development, considering that most of the digitization work had been completed over the two previous decades, thanks to the efforts of [Oyez](https://www.oyez.org/about) and its many contributors (which NARA finally acknowledged publicly in [March 2024](https://unwritten-record.blogs.archives.gov/2024/03/15/behind-the-scenes-providing-access-to-supreme-court-oral-arguments/)).

No detailed mappings across all these rich data sets exist yet, but hopefully they will materialize over time.  To help kick things off, I've started working on an [audit](/ussc/audit/).

That audit relies in part on the audio materials (and associated metadata) sitting in [NARA's SCOTUS Collection](https://catalog.archives.gov/id/594):

  - [Sound Recordings of Oral Arguments - Black Series, October 1955-December 1972](nara/audio/black/)
  - [Sound Recordings of Oral Arguments - Red Series, December 1972-June 27, 2005](nara/audio/red/)
  - [Sound Recordings of Oral Arguments - Gold Series, October 3, 2005-May 13, 2020](nara/audio/gold/)

Other [Series](https://catalog.archives.gov/search-within/594?levelOfDescription=series&limit=100&sort=title%3Aasc) in NARA's SCOTUS collection include:
