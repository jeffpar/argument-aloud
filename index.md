# Mapping U.S. Supreme Court Data Across the Internet

With the [National Archives](https://www.archives.gov), [Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov), and even (*gasp*) the [U.S. Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov) itself making more of the Court's current and historical information available online, having some roadmaps to -- and mappings between -- all that data is becoming increasingly important.

Add private collections to the mix, such as [The Oyez Project](https://www.oyez.org), [Justia](https://supreme.justia.com), and [The Supreme Court Database](http://scdb.wustl.edu), and the wealth of information becomes both a blessing and a curse.

In 2023, NARA finally made the fully digitized collection of [U.S. Supreme Court audio recordings](https://unwritten-record.blogs.archives.gov/2023/05/30/oyez-oyez-oyez-sound-recordings-of-the-supreme-court-of-the-united-states-now-fully-digitized/) available -- a long-overdue development, considering that most of the digitization work had been completed over the two previous decades, thanks to the efforts of [Oyez](https://www.oyez.org/about) and its many contributors (which NARA neglected to thank or mention).

No detailed mappings across all these rich data sets exist yet, but hopefully they will materialize over time.  To help kick things off, here is a tiny sampling of the materials sitting in [NARA's SCOTUS Collection](https://catalog.archives.gov/id/594), starting with its audio series:

  - [Sound Recordings of Oral Arguments - Black Series, October 1955-December 1972](nara/audio/black/)
  - [Sound Recordings of Oral Arguments - Red Series, December 1972-June 27, 2005](nara/audio/red/)
  - Sound Recordings of Oral Arguments - Gold Series, October 3, 2005-May 13, 2020 [link coming soon]

Other [Series](https://catalog.archives.gov/search-within/594?levelOfDescription=series&limit=100&sort=title%3Aasc) in NARA's SCOTUS collection include:
