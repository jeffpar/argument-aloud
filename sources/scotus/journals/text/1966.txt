I would grant these petitioners application for certiorari. The
petitioners have been sentenced from 4 to 15 years imprisonment in
the penitentiary under these alleged circumstances. After months of
negotiations between petitioners and the United States Attorney, he
agreed to recommend certain minimum sentences if petitioners would
plead guilty. Petitioners agreed, pleaded guilty, and the United
States Attorney recommended the minimum sentences as promised.
But when the first petitioner appeared for sentencing before a differ-
ent judge, that judge imposed a sentence in excess of that recom-
mended by the United States Attorney. That petitioner then
immediately sought to withdraw his guilty plea, and the others ap-
parently seeing the writing on the wall, immediately moved to with-
draw their pleas or adjourn their sentencing. Not only did the judge
deny these motions and proceed to sentence the remaining petitioners,
but, according to petitioners, he refused even to entertain these mo-
tions and to hear argument thereon. Petitioners then filed timely
notices of appeal. But their counsel failed to file their trial court
records in the Court of Appeals within 40 days of giving such notices
of appeal as required by Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 39 (c). Some three
weeks after this time had expired, the Government moved to dismiss
the appeals, and though petitioners' counsel then promised to docket
the appeals within 10 days and to file briefs within 30, the Court of
Appeals dismissed for want of prosecution. This was done in spite
of counsel's explanation that the delay was due to counsel's inability
more quickly to determine what type of postconviction remedy to
pursue and counsel's assurance, by allegation of the above facts, that
there were substantial legal questions involved.
Regardless of the truthfulness of their allegations, petitioners were
denied any opportunity to substantiate them because their appeals
were dismissed before their lawyers could file their appeal papers.
Thus this case is added to a growing list of cases in which the Fed-
eral Rules have been utilized to deprive a litigant of his day in court
simply because his lawyer has failed to file some paper within the
time specified by the Rules. See, e. g., Beaufort Concrete Co. v. At-
lantic States Constr. Co., 352 F. 2d 460, cert. denied, 384 U.S. 1004
(dissenting opinion of BLACK, J.); Lord v. Helmandollar, 121 U. S.
App. D. C. 168, 348 F. 2d 780, BLACK, J., dissenting; Riess v. Murchi-
son, cert. denied, 383 U. S. 946, BLACK, J.,dissenting; Link v. Wabash
R. Co., 370 U. S. 626, 636, BLACK, J., joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE,
dissenting.
I have always thought that where a litigant's money or property
is at stake in a civil case, "The basic purpose of the Federal Rules is
to administer justice through fair trials, not through summary dis-

missals as necessary as they may be on occasion." Surowitz v. Hilton
Hotels Corp., 383 U. S. 363, 373. I have no doubt that this is true
in a criminal case where a litigant's liberty is in issue. The Criminal
Rules "are not, and were not intended to be, a rigid code to have
an inflexible meaning irrespective of the circumstances. Rule 2 begins
with the admonition that '[t]hese rules are intended to provide for
the just determination of every criminal proceeding. They shall be
construed to secure simplicity in procedure, fairness in administration,
and the elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay.'" Fallen v.
United States, 378 U. S. 139, 142. There is no provision in the Rules
making dismissal of an appeal mandatory for failure to file the record
within the time prescribed by Rule 39 (c). The Court of Appeals
acquired jurisdiction upon petitioners' filing their notices of appeal,
and Rule 45 (b) expressly empowered that court "at any time in its
discretion" to permit the late filing of a record if the failure to file
it on time "was the result of excusable neglect.'
"
Here I think there has been an obvious, unexcusable failure to ex-
ercise that discretion reposed in judges to administer the Rules in the
interest of "the just determination of every criminal proceedings.”
Petitioners may languish in prison for many years, not because their
appeals were without merit, but because, through no apparent fault on
their part, their lawyers were three weeks late in seeking to file their
appeal papers. Since petitioners were never released on bail pending
appeal, I fail to see how the Government could be prejudiced by this
short delay or how-consistent with the public's interest in the fair
administration of criminal justice-it could have any interest in as-
suring that petitioners' appeals be disposed of other than on the
merits. I would reverse and remand these cases to the Court of Ap-
peals for a decision on the merits of petitioners' allegations.

No. 124. Matias Sandoval et ux., petitioners, v. Jack Rattikin,
Trustee. Petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Civil Appeals
of Texas, Thirteenth Supreme Judicial District, denied. Dissenting
opinion by Mr. Justice Fortas with whom Mr. Justice Douglas joins:
In my judgment, this petition presents important issues as to the
scope of the requirement, derived from the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment, that state courts in civil actions must afford
to each litigant a "proper opportunity to present his evidence." Saun-
ders v. Shaw, 244 U.S. 317, 319 (1917). Cf. Western & Atl. R. Co. v.
Henderson, 279 U.S. 639 (1929); Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545
(1965); Mullane v. Central Hanover Tr. Co., 339 U.S. 306 (1950).
Petitioners are illiterate indigents. They speak only Spanish.
They and their five children have lived for many years on the meager
homestead involved in this case. Petitioners executed a deed to the
homestead. Respondent is assignee of this deed. Respondent
brought this action and obtained a judgment confirming his title and
possessory rights to the property under the deed. Petitioners seek
review of the judgment of the Texas Court of Civil Appeals which
affirmed this judgment.
At the trial, petitioners were represented by a Legal Aid attorney.
The trial was perfunctory. After judgment was entered for respond-
ent, petitioners obtained new counsel who filed a timely motion for new
trial. This motion alleged that petitioners had a good and sufficient
defense to the action: namely, that the "deed" was in truth a mortgage
given to secure a debt and that respondent took with notice of this
fact. The motion alleged that this defense was not adduced at trial
because of the default of petitioners' Legal Aid counsel.
The trial court held an elaborate hearing on the motion for new
trial. The Legal Aid lawyer who had represented petitioners at the
trial testified candidly that he had not had adequate time to prepare
the case, and that he was further handicapped by his inability to speak
or understand Spanish.
Petitioners' counsel in this Court urge that, in the circumstances
of this case, the refusal of the trial court to grant the timely motion
for a new trial deprived petitioners of their rights under the Four-
teenth Amendment. I believe that we should grant the writ and rule
upon the question so presented.

To some extent, a lawyer's client like a doctor's patient must suffer
the consequences of his champion's mistakes. But there are limits;
and the courts are and should be quick to relieve the client of his
lawyer's default whenever that is feasible and does not result in unfair-
ness to others. See Mr. Justice Black's dissent from the denial of
certiorari in Santana v. United States, 385 U.S. (1966). Obvi-
ously, this principle applies to the defaults of lawyers made available
to aid indigents. The measure of constitutional protection afforded
citizens who are recipients of free legal services, whether provided
by the State or by private charity, is not less than that available to
those who pay their own way.
While the present case received the careful attention of both the
trial court and the Court of Civil Appeals of Texas, for reasons stated
at length in the dissenting opinion of Judge Sharpe in the Texas
Court of Civil Appeals, I am of the opinion that this case deserves and
requires the consideration of this Court. I would grant the petition.

No. 75, Misc. Robert Winters, petitioner, v. Henry Beck, Super-
intendent of the Pulaski County Penal Farm. Petition for writ of
certiorari to the Supreme Court of Arkansas denied. Dissenting
opinion by Mr. Justice Stewart:
The petitioner, an indigent Negro, was arrested on a charge of
"immorality," a misdemeanor under an ordinance of Little Rock,
Arkansas. Later the same day he was brought before the municipal
court, where, after pleading not guilty, he was tried, convicted, and
sentenced to 30 days in jail and a $254 fine, including costs. He was
unable to pay the fine, so his punishment was converted under the
Arkansas "dollar-a-day" statute (Ark. Stat. Ann. § 19-2416 (Repl.
1956)) to imprisonment for 912 months.
At his trial the petitioner was not represented by counsel. He did
not ask for the assistance of counsel and was not informed by the trial
judge, or by anybody else, of any right to counsel, appointed or re-
tained. The judge did not advise him of the nature of the charges
against him, of the possible penalty, or of his right to make objections,
cross-examine witnesses, present witnesses in his own behalf, or to
have a trial de novo in the county circuit court under Ark. Stat. Ann.
§§ 44-115, 509 (Repl. 1964). Not surprisingly, the petitioner did not
object to the evidence offered by the prosecution, did not cross-examine
the prosecution witnesses, did not present witnesses in his own behalf,
and did not exercise his right to a trial de novo in the county circuit
court. Also not surprisingly, the petitioner did not question the
vagueness of the charge against him nor the validity of converting a
sentence of 30 days into one of 912 months solely because of his poverty.
From the prison farm where he was incarcerated, the petitioner
applied to the Supreme Court of Arkansas for a writ of habeas corpus,
upon the ground that he had been unconstitutionally tried and con-
victed "without the benefit of counsel and without being advised of his
rights to counsel." The Arkansas Supreme Court denied relief, hold-
ing that the constitutional rule of Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S.
335, does not apply "in misdemeanor cases."
This decision of the Supreme Court of Arkansas is in conflict with
decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit,
which has held that indigent defendants have a constitutional right
to counsel in misdemeanor cases. McDonald v. Moore, 353 F. 2d 106;
Harvey v. Mississippi, 340 F. 2d 263. This conflict must be resolved,
unless the Constitution of the United States is going to mean one thing
in Arkansas and something else in Mississippi.
In Gideon v. Wainwright, supra, we said that "any person haled
into court, who is too poor to hire a lawyer, cannot be assured a fair
trial unless counsel is provided for him. This seems to us to be an
obvious truth." No State should be permitted to repudiate those

MONDAY, OCTOBER 17, 1966
75
words by arbitrarily attaching the label "misdemeanor" to a crimi-
nal offense.¹ I think this Court has a duty to resolve the conflict and
clarify the scope of Gideon v. Wainwright. I do not suggest what the
ultimate resolution of this problem should be, but I do suggest that the
answer cannot be made to depend upon artificial or arbitrary labels of
"felony" or "misdemeanor" attached to criminal offenses by 50 differ-
ent States. Whatever one's view may be as to the appropriate exercise
of this Court's certiorari jurisdiction, surely it is at least our duty to
see to it that a vital guarantee of the United States Constitution is
accorded with an even hand in all the States.
For these reasons I would grant certiorari, hear argument, and
decide the important issue which this case clearly presents.
Mr. Justice Black would also grant the petition for certiorari.
No. 91, Misc. Thomas F. Budd, petitioner, v. California. Peti-
tion for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of California denied.
Dissenting opinion by Mr. Justice Fortas:
This case presents the important question whether punishment may
constitutionally be inflicted, pursuant to § 647 (f) of the California
Penal Code, upon a person suffering from the disease of alcoholism-
as distinguished from drunkenness or periodic, voluntary overindul-
gence in intoxicants. The California statute provides, in part, that
any person "found in any public place under the influence of intoxi-
cating liquor *** in such a condition that he is unable to exercise
care for his own safety or that of others" is guilty of a misdemeanor.
Petitioner challenges the statute on the ground, among others, that its
application to him, allegedly an alcoholic, constitutes "cruel and un-
usual punishment" in contravention of the Eighth Amendment of the
Federal Constitution.
I believe that we should grant the writ. The trial court made no
finding as to whether petitioner suffered from alcoholism, presumably
because of its legal conclusion that alcoholism affords no defense to the
statutory charge. The trial record squarely presents the issue whether
alcoholism is, as a matter of law, a defense to the charge. There is
abundant evidence in this record to impel a finding that petitioner is
an alcoholic, that he suffers from an illness which results in inability to
control either his drinking or certain aspects of behavior after he has
been drinking. And the constitutional questions sought to be raised
here were presented to each of the state courts through which this case.
has passed.²
1 In Arkansas, some misdemeanors are punishable by up to three years imprisonment.
(Ark. Stat. Ann. § 41-805 (Repl. 1964).)
2 Petitioner is seeking review of the denial by the California Supreme Court of a writ of
habeas corpus.
Respondent challenges our jurisdiction on the ground that petitioner
failed to seek review here of the summary affirmance by the Appellate Department of the
California Superior Court, or of that court's refusal to certify the case to the District Court
of Appeals. Although determination of the jurisdictional issue can be postponed until the

MONDAY, OCTOBER 17, 1966

It is time for this Court to decide whether persons suffering from
the illness of alcoholism and exhibiting its symptoms or effects may be
punished criminally therefor. The Court has already held that a
State may not punish for narcotics addiction, that to do so would
violate the constitutional prohibition of cruel and unusual punish-
ment. Robinson v. California, 370 U.S. 660 (1962). Mr. Justice
Stewart's opinion for the Court in Robinson makes it clear that a State
may not constitutionally inflict punishment for an illness, whether the
illness be narcotics addiction or "the common cold." Id., at 667.3 We
should hear argument in the present case to consider whether it pre-
sents a situation which commands similar constitutional proscription.
The question has great practical and social significance. We are
told that some 6,000,000 Americans are afflicted with alcoholism and
that each year more than 1,500,000 arrests-three of every eight-are
for drunkenness. Although we do not know how many of those
arrested for drunkenness are properly classifiable as alcoholic-that
is, whose conduct may be traced to illness rather than to choice-there
is ample evidence that the number is very large.4
Petitioner's case presents the familiar and dismal round of repeated
sojourns in the "drunk-tank"; the spectacle of repeated cycles of
arrests for "drunkenness," incarceration, release, and arrest "for
drunkenness" all over again. At age 56, petitioner has a record of
more than 40 arrests for drunkenness or conduct while drunk. There
was testimony that petitioner has been an alcoholic for over 30 years,
that his act of buying liquor, as well as as drinking to intoxication, is
involuntary. In the past 10 years, he has been through the arrest-
release cycle more than 20 times.
This record and the medical literature admonish us that punishment
of alcoholics does society no good. It can be applauded only by the
-
-
case is heard on the merits, no reason appears why we cannot properly review the denial
of habeas corpus. It appears that the California Supreme Court, in which petitioner
sought a writ of habeas corpus in lieu of proceeding here by way of certiorari, had juris-
diction over the questions raised. In re Klor, 64 Adv. Cal. 883, P. 2d (1966); In re
Zerbe, 60 Cal. 2d 666, 388 P. 2d 182 (1964); see In re Jackson, 61 Cal. 2d 500, 393 P. 2d
420 (1964). Accordingly, we have jurisdiction to entertain this as a timely petition for
review of the final decision of the highest court of the State.
³ This principle, that the sick should be treated in hospitals rather than prisons, is begin-
ning to affect our society's views as to the disposition of even those who are "ill" but, unlike
Robinson, are convicted for crimes other than the illness itself. See S. 2191 and H.R.
9167, bills pending in the Eighty-ninth Congress to provide civil commitment rather than
imprisonment for certain narcotics addicts convicted of federal criminal offenses. See
112 Cong. Rec. 24401-24421 (1966), and especially, the statement of Senator McClellan
whose committee reported the Senate bill out. According to Senator Ervin, who joined in
✶ ✶ that
urging passage, the rationale for the proposed legislation is "the proposition *
drug addiction is primarily a medical problem, not a criminal problem. * * * We must
heed the advice our medical authorities have offered for many years and establish proce-
dures for the medical treatment of individual addicts designed to cure and rehabilitate
them so that they can be returned to society as useful, productive citizens." Id., at 24419.
* See 162 Journal of the American Medical Assn. 749 (October 1956); “Alcoholism,”
Public Health Serv. Pub. No. 730 (1963); Message of the President to Congress, March 1,

uninformed or the sadistic. It is neither a deterrent nor a cure for
those afflicted. On the contrary, as testified here, it is not only ineffec-
tive, but "particularly antitherapeutic because it increases the feelings
of worthlessness that all alcoholics have ***" This does not, of
course, mean that alcoholics need be, or should be, permitted to en-
danger themselves and others, or to be public nuisances. Each of the
50 States has some sort of noncriminal procedure for dealing with
alcoholics, and in each State some procedure exists or can be provided
for intelligent, purposeful handling of the various aspects of the
problem.
Our morality does not permit us to punish for illness. We do not im-
pose punishment for involuntary conduct, whether the lack of volition
results from "insanity," addiction to narcotics, or from other illnesses.
The use of the crude and formidable weapon of criminal punishment
of the alcoholic is neither seemly nor sensible, neither purposeful nor
civilized. This Court should determine whether it is constitutionally
permissible, or whether, as the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Cir-
cuit 5 and four of the eight judges of the Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit 6 have held, it is cruel and unusual punish-
ment punishment in the absence of volitional fault, punishment
which our Constitution forbids.
Mr. Justice Douglas joins this opinion, believing that being an
alcohol addict, like being a drug addict, is beyond the reach of the
criminal law for the reasons stated in his separate opinion in Robinson
v. California, 370 U.S. 660, 668.

No. 759, Misc. John DeJoseph, petitioner, v. Connecticut. Peti-
tion for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Errors of Con-
necticut and/or the Appellate Division of the Circuit Court of Con-
necticut denied. Dissenting opinion by Mr. Justice Stewart with
whom Mr. Justice Black and Mr. Justice Douglas join.
This case illustrates, in even more compelling terms than Winters v.
Beck, No. 75, Misc., this Term, the need for this Court to make clear
the meaning of Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335.
The petitioner was charged in a Connecticut court with criminal non-
support, a misdemeanor under Connecticut law punishable by impris-
onment of up to a year. At his arraignment he told the judge that he
was indigent, and requested that counsel be appointed. The judge
informed him that appointment of counsel was not possible because
the charge was only a misdemeanor. At trial, the petitioner again
indicated that he wanted counsel, but his request was ignored by the
trial judge. He attempted to conduct his own defense, and was con-
victed and sentenced to six months in jail. The conviction was affirmed

MONDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1966
146
by the Appellate Division of the Connecticut Circuit Court. That
court noted that the petitioner had failed to request findings on the is-
sue of his indigency, as required by local practice rules, and held that
without more proof of indigency he could not claim that he had been.
deprived of any right to appointed counsel. Clearly, constitutional
claims cannot be blocked by such procedural obstacles, in a case where
the defendant, appearing alone in court, saw his requests for counsel
denied outright by one judge and totally ignored by another.
The petitioner's conviction in this case is squarely at odds with the
decision of the Federal District Court for the District of Connecticut
in Arbo v. Hegstrom (Civil No. 11.340, decided June 16, 1966). Arbo
was charged in Connecticut with criminal nonsupport, the identical
offense with which the petitioner here was charged and convicted.
Unlike the petitioner, Arbo pleaded guilty and never requested that
counsel be appointed for him. Nevertheless, the Federal District
Judge held that Gideon guaranteed Arbo the right to appointed coun-
sel. Arbo's conviction was set aside because he had not been told of his
right to counsel, and the State has not appealed.
Arbo was set free. The petitioner, convicted of the same offense
in the same State, remains in jail. When the meaning of a fundamen-
tal constitutional right depends on which court in Connecticut a per-
son turns to for redress, I believe it is time for this Court to intervene.
I would grant certiorari and set this case for argument.

Authority et al. Petition for writ of certiorari to the United States:
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and for other relief denied.

Dissenting opinion by Mr. Justice Douglas with whom the Chief
Justice concurs:
This case involves an important question regarding the right of
a poor tenant to remain in possession of his shelter and defend against
eviction in a court of law. It is part of the larger problem regarding
the inability of indigent and deprived persons to voice their com-
plaints through the existing institutional framework, and vividly
demonstrates the disparity between the access of the affluent to the
judicial machinery and that of the poor in violation of the Equal
Protection Clause.
The Georgia summary eviction statute provides that a landlord may
oust a tenant in a very swift, expedient manner. The landlord files
with a judge of the superior court or justice of the peace an affidavit
that the tenant has held over or has failed to pay rent (Ga. Code Ann.
§ 61–301 (1966)); and the judge issues a dispossessory warrant order-
ing the sheriff to evict the tenant and his possessions. Ga. Code Ann.
§ 61–302 (1966). The tenant may arrest the proceedings and prevent
his summary eviction by filing a counter-affidavit denying the land-
lord's allegations (Ga. Code Ann. § 61-303 (1966)) and thereby obtain
a jury trial on the facts in issue. Ga. Code Ann. § 61-304 (1966).
But in order to remain in possession and obtain a trial (see Ga. Code
Ann. § 61-304 (1966)) the tenant must "tender a bond with good secu-
rity, payable to the landlord, for the payment of such sum, with costs,
be recovered against him on the trial of the case."1 Ga. Code
Ann. § 61-303 (1966). If the tenant is not able to furnish the security
bond, he is summarily evicted. The effect is that the indigent tenant
as may
The security required is substantial.
Ga. Code Ann. § 61-305 (1966) provides:
"If the issue specified in [§ 61-304] shall be determined against the tenant. judgment
shall go against him for double the rent reserved or stipulated to be paid . . . and such
judgment in any case shall also provide for the payment of future double rent until the
tenant surrenders possession of the lands or tenements to the landlord after an appeal or
otherwise . . . .”
The insurance companies which posted dispossessory bonds informed petitioners that it
would be necessary for each petitioner to put up a cash collateral for double the rent for
about six months, as well as pay a bond premium.

is deprived of his shelter, and the life of his family is disrupted—all
without a hearing-solely because of his poverty.
In this case respondent, petitioners' landlord, obtained a disposses-
sory warrant after filing an affidavit that petitioners had failed to pay
rent. Petitioners attempted to file counter-affidavits raising a number
of defenses, together with affidavits that they were unable to post secu-
rity due to their indigency. Apparently the affidavits were rejected.
Petitioners then petitioned the Superior Court attempting to arrest
the summary eviction. They sought vacation of the dispossessory
warrants and injunctions against the landlord and the sheriff restrain-
ing them from executing the warrants. Each petitioner offered to pay
into the court registry any rents due or to become due during the
pendency of the action. Their petitions were denied and the action
dismissed. Thereafter, petitioners were summarily evicted. On ap-
peal, the Georgia Supreme Court held that the case was moot because
petitioners had been evicted.
The State, acting on the landlord's behalf, argues that certiorari
should be denied on that ground. Whether or not a case is moot is
a federal question which must be resolved by this Court. The finding
of mootness by the State Supreme Court is not binding on us. See
Ward v. Love County, 253 U.S. 17, 22; Love v. Griffin, 266 U.S. 32,
33-44; Liner v. Jafco, 375 U.S. 301. The mootness doctrine is a bene-
ficial one, expressive of the need for adverse parties who will vigor-
ously argue the conflicting contentions to the Court and a necessary
one in light of the requirements of Article III. But if this case were
held to be moot, no tenant would ever be able to bring the statute to
this Court. His eviction would render the case moot and preclude
a challenge to the very statute causing the eviction. The statute would
be immune from the constitutional challenge. Perhaps I am wrong.
But the point is so substantial as to require oral argument.
The effect of the security statute is to grant an affluent tenant a hear-
ing and to deny an indigent tenant a hearing. The ability to obtain
a hearing is thus made to turn upon the tenant's wealth. On numerous
occasions this Court has struck down financial limitations on the ability
to obtain judicial review. See e.g., Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12;
Burns v. Ohio, 360 U.S. 252, Smith v. Bennett, 365 US. 708. We have
recognized that the promise of equal justice for all would be an empty
phrase for the poor, if the ability to obtain judicial relief were made
to turn on the length of a person's purse. It is true that these cases.
have dealt with criminal proceedings. But the Equal Protection
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is not limited to criminal prose-
cutions. Its protections extend as well to civil matters. I can see
no more justification for denying an indigent a hearing in an eviction
proceeding solely because of his poverty than for denying an indigent

the right to appeal (Burns v. Ohio, supra), the right to file a habeas
corpus petition (Smith v. Bennett, supra), or the right to obtain a
transcript necessary for appeal (Griffin v. Illinois, supra).
It is no answer to say that the Georgia procedure is fairer than
the procedures of some States, whereby a tenant can be evicted without
any opportunity for a hearing. Though a State may not constitu-
tionally be required to afford a hearing before its process is used to
evict a tenant, having provided one it cannot discriminate between
rich and poor. It cannot consistently with the Equal Protection
Clause provide a hearing in such a way as to discriminate against
some "on account of their poverty." Griffin v. Illinois, supra, at 18.
The problem of housing for the poor is one of the most acute facing
the Nation. The poor are relegated to ghettos and are beset by sub-
standard housing at exorbitant rents. Because of their lack of bar-
gaining power, the poor are made to accept onerous lease terms. Sum-
mary eviction proceeds are the order of the day. Default judgments
in eviction proceedings are obtained in machinegun rapidity, since
the indigent cannot afford counsel to defend. Housing laws often have
a built-in bias against the poor. Slumlords have a tight hold on the
Nation. Lyford, The Airtight Cage (1966). 2 And see Schoor, Slums
and Social Insecurity (1964).
The plight of the poor is being somewhat ameliorated by federal and
state programs (particularly the Neighborhood Legal Services under
OEO) and by private organizations dedicated to the representation
of indigents in civil matters. This Court of course does not sit to cure
social ills that beset the country. But when we are faced with a statute
that apparently violates the Equal Protection Clause by patently dis-
criminating against the poor and thereby worsening their already
sorry plight, we should address ourselves to it. I would grant
certiorari.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN is of the opinion that certiorari should be
granted.
2 "They have not the economic power to make themselves heard, and their official political
representatives have built their power on the ghetto and are committed to its perpetuation.
In New York City a vast, informal machinery funnels society's discipline and health prob-
lems into the West Ninety-third Streets, and just about every sector of the establishment
participates in running the machinery or lubricating it: slumlords who rent to the dead
as well as the living provided they get a good price for it and have immunity from fire,
building, health, and rent regulations; the city employee who collaborates in the arrange-
ment: the welfare and health departments that go along because they have no other alter-
native judges who tap the slumlord on the wrist on the rare occasions when he is
brought into court. Approval of the system is given by business leaders who lead the fight
against adequate welfare and housing, prosperous financial institutions that refuse to
lend money for private investment in slum rehabilitation; foundations that avoid any sig-
nificant commitment to abolition of the slum; labor unions that have abandoned the low-
paid worker and practice racial discrimination; and white and black political organiza-
tions that have a vested interest in segregation and race politics. When the slum is used
as a concentration camp for the criminal and disabled, the virulence of all the diseases
endemic in slum life is intensified." Lyford, supra, pp. xxi-xxii.

of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-

No. 739, Misc. Ray Wayne Pierce, petitioner, v. John W. Turner,
Warden. Petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Utah
denied. Mr. Justice Douglas:
Denial of certiorari is proper in this case. I see no constitutional
bar to a state court treating a petition for habeas corpus as a petition
for rehearing where the habeas corpus petition raises the same ques-
tions as an earlier appeal. But federal habeas corpus is not so
cramped, and the petitioner can, of course, petition a federal district
court for a writ of habeas corpus. The underlying question is
whether the M'Naghten test of legal insanity is a constitutionally per-
missible test of criminal liability in light of the contemporary state
of knowledge on the problems of insanity. Should that test give way
to the 128 years of experience in the fields of psychiatry and psychol-
ogy since its formulation? Should it be replaced by the more sophis-
ticated and realistic Durham test (Durham v. United States, 214 F.
2d 862) or some other test more in keeping with due process?
No. 1097, Misc. Raymond Ross, Jr., petitioner, v. George J. Beto,
Director, Texas Department of Corrections. Petition for writ of
certiorari to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas denied. Mr.
Justice Douglas is of the opinion that certiorari should be granted.
No. 1176, Misc. Rudolph L. Sandoval, petitioner, v. California.
Petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of California
denied. Dissenting opinion by Mr. Justice Douglas:
Police officers obtained warrants for the arrest of Coates and five
others. They had been informed by an informer not known to be
reliable, that Coates concealed heroin and burglary loot in his home,
that the house served as a narcotics headquarters, and that at least
one "connection" contacted Coats there by telephone. Apparently
this information had been partially corroborated by an independent
investigation implicating Coates and the others in a burglary opera-
tion. Officers stationed at the house saw Coates and a woman leave.
They arrested Coates, saw puncture marks on the woman's hands, and
arrested her. A search of the woman's person uncovered narcotics.
The police then entered Coates' home and saw narcotics in plain
view. They arrested the occupants and began an extensive search of
the premises. During the search, a telephone rang and an officer
answered it. A voice asked, "Is this Jessie?" The officer replied that
t
1
th

ין
MONDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1967
257
it was. The caller said, "Man, where have you been? I've been
waiting for you a long time. You were supposed to meet me some
time ago." The officer replied that he had been delayed and would
be along in a few minutes. The caller then said, "Well, hurry up,
man, I can't stand around with this stuff in my pocket on the street.
I might get picked up." When the conversation ended, the officer
asked Coates what it meant. Coates explained that he had arranged
to pick up heroin from a person named Rudy, gave the police a de-
scription of Rudy and his car, and specified the meeting place. The
officers rushed off to the designated place and arrested and searched
petitioner, finding narcotics used at petitioner's trial for possessing
narcotics.
The California Supreme Court held that the officers had probable
cause to arrest petitioner. The entry into Coates' home was lawful
because the discovery of the narcotics on the woman, together with
the informant's information and the information from the independent
investigation, gave the officers probable cause to believe that people
in the house possessed narcotics. Since they were lawfully in the
house the police could answer the telephone and conceal their identities
in order "to learn of possible unlawful activities." 65 Adv. Cal. App.
309, 314. The information given by Coates was confirmed when the
officers saw petitioner. Thus, I assume that they had probable cause
to arrest and search petitioner.
"
While we have sustained the validity of searches of the home of a
person validly arrested (Agnello v. United States, 269 U. S. 20; Harris
v. United States, 331 U. S. 145; United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U. S.
56) we have stressed that the bounds of such searches are not unlimited.
A search of the place where an arrest is made may be made "in order
to find and seize things connected with the crime as its fruits or as the
means by which it is committed, as well as weapons and other things to
effect an escape from custody. Agnello v. United States, supra,
at 30. Over and over again we have emphasized that a search incident
to arrest cannot be a general exploratory search, but must be narrowly
confined. See, e. g., United States v. Lefkowitz, 285 U. S. 451; Harris
v. United States, supra, at 152–153; United States v. Rabinowitz, supra,
at 62. In those cases, the search was designed to uncover fruits or in-
strumentalities of the crime for which the person was arrested. In
this case the officer was engaged in a fishing expedition when he an-
swered the telephone. He sought "to learn of possible unlawful ac-
tivities." 65 Adv. Cal. App. 309, 314. And, the "possible unlawful
activities" about which he was curious were not confined to those on
the part of Coates' or even to those of the type which gave the officers
justification for entering the house. The officer who answered the
telephone and used artifice was engaged in a general, exploratory
search to obtain evidence and leads incriminating anyone of any

MONDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1967
258
possible crime. Until the intercepted conversation, there was abso-
lutely no lead connecting petitioner with any unlawful activity.
The permissible bounds of a search of the premises of an arrest
have thus been extended. The import of such extension is dangerous.
Police often lawfully enter a house to make an arrest. If the decision
below is sustained the police are given a roving commission to do
things condemned by the Fourth Amendment-as long as they remain
in the home which they have taken over. They are given license to
make a general, exploratory search which the Fourth Amendment was
designed to prevent.
It might be argued that petitioner lacks standing to object to the
unlawful police conduct. This would be on the theory that he had
no possessory interest in the home subjected to the search. It should
be noted that neither the California Supreme Court, nor the State,
relied upon petitioner's lack of standing. We have liberally inter-
preted the provision of Rule 41(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure that a defendant must be a "person aggrieved" in order to
suppress evidence in a federal court. See, e.g., Jeffers v. United States,
342 U.S. 48; Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257. Argument is at
least warranted on this point.
For the reasons stated I would grant certiorari in this case.

No. 928. Elam Reamuel Temple, petitioner, v. United States. Pe-
tition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals
for the Fourth Circuit denied. Dissenting opinion by Mr. Justice
Black with whom Mr. Justice Douglas joins:
Under 18 U.S.C. § 401 (1) a court may punish as contempt "mis-
behavior of any person in its presence or so near thereto as to obstruct
the administration of justice." We held in In re Michael, 326 U.S.
224, that this contempt power, limited as Congress intended it to
be, could not be used to punish a person merely for committing per-
jury in the court's presence without the additional showing that an
actual obstruction of justice was caused thereby. Accord, Ex parte
Hudgings, 249 U.S. 378; see In re McConnell, 370 U.S. 230, 234, 236;
cf. Cammer v. United States, 350 U.S. 399; Brown v. United States,
356 U.S. 148, 153.
Petitioner, an attorney, represented a plaintiff in a lawsuit against
the Government in federal district court. When he failed to file a
brief within the time specified by the court's pretrial order, the Govern-
ment moved to dismiss his client's complaint for want of prosecution.
The District Judge refused to do so upon petitioner's representation
in his belated brief and in open court that the delay was due to illness
on his part. The court went on to hear the case on its merits and, after
a trial which lasted only an hour, rendered judgment for the Govern-
ment. A year later, petitioner was charged with contempt of court
under § 401 (1) for having misrepresented to the judge that he was ill.
Tried summarily by that same judge without a jury, petitioner was con-
victed and sentenced to six months' imprisonment. Though the Court
of Appeals reversed and remanded for a new trial on grounds not here
material, it flatly held, with little discussion and no citation to
authority, that "lying to a judge is certainly misbehavior in the court's
presence and therefore punishable under § 401." 349 F. 2d 116, 117.
Petitioner was retired summarily before a different judge and again
convicted of contempt of court, apparently on the basis of the Court of
Appeals prior holding that “lying to a judge" in and of itself con-
stitutes contempt.
Since there is nothing in this record to suggest that either the Gov-
ernment attempted to prove or the trial judge found that petitioner's
misrepresentation actually obstructed the administration of justice,
his conviction on its face runs counter to In re Michael. There is not
a vestige of evidence to support it. Cf. Thompson v. Louisville, 362
U.S. 199. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals refused to reverse this
illegal conviction and dismissed petitioner's appeal on the ground that,
while he gave an oral notice of appeal and filed an appeal bond at
the end of his trial, he did not file a written notice of appeal within
the 10-day period specified by Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 37(a)(2).

MONDAY, MARCH 13, 1967
274
Although only four days after that period expired petitioner moved
the trial court to accept a written notice of appeal, and although the
trial court then found that petitioner's delay was the result of excus-
able neglect," the Court of Appeals refused to hold the oral notice
adequate. The court noted that the result might be different had this
case arisen under the 1966 amendment to Rule 37 (a) (2) which now
provides that "upon a showing of excusable neglect, the district court
may, before or after the time has expired, . . . extend the time for filing
the notice of appeal otherwise allowed to any party for a period not
to exceed 30 days...." The court also refrained from deciding "that
an oral notice of appeal transcribed into the record would never be
sufficient to invoke jurisdiction in the court of appeals." Yet the court
allowed a plainly invalid conviction to stand. Because I believe that
the Court of Appeals, in the words of Fallen v. United States, 378
U.S. 139, 142, "overlooked. . . the fact that the Rules are not, and were
not intended to be, a rigid code to have an inflexible meaning irrespec-
tive of the circumstances" and because I find it "apparent when the
circumstances of this case are examined" that "the Rules were not
approached with sympathy for their purpose," I would grant certio-
rari in this case to correct a clear miscarriage of justice. Cf. Berman
v. United States, 378 U.S. 530 (dissenting opinion).

No. 1012. David Henry Mitchell, III, petitioner, v. United States.
Petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals
for the Second Circiut denied. Mr. Justice Douglas dissents:
Petitioner did not report for induction as ordered, was indicted,
convicted, and sentenced to five years imprisonment and his conviction
was affirmed. 369 F. 2d 323. His defense was that the "war" in
Vietnam was being conducted in violation of various treaties to which
we were a signatory especially the Treaty of London of August 8, 1945,
59 Stat. 1544, which in Article (a) declares that “waging of a war
of aggression" is a "crime against peace" imposing "individual respon-
sibility." Article 8 provides:
"The fact that the Defendant acted pursuant to order of his Govern-
ment or of a superior shall not free him from responsibility, but may
be considered in mitigation of punishment if the Tribunal determines
that justice so requires."
Petitioner claimed that the "war" in Vietnam was a “war of aggres-
sion" within the meaning of the Treaty of London and that Article 8

MONDAY, MARCH 20, 1967

makes him responsible for participating in it even though he is ordered
to do so.*
Mr. Justice Jackson, the United State prosecutor at Nuremberg,
stated: "If certain acts in violation of treaties are crimes, they are
crimes whether the United States does them or whether Germany does
them, and we are not prepared to lay down a rule of criminal conduct
against others which we would not be willing to have invoked against
us." (International Conference on Military Trials, Dept. State Pub.
No. 3880, p. 330.)
Article VI, cl. 2 of the Constitution states that "treaties" are a
part of "the supreme law of the land; and the Judges in every State
shall be bound thereby."
There is a considerable body of opinion that our actions in Vietnam
constitute the waging of an aggressive "war."
This case presents the questions:
(1) whether the Treaty of London is a treaty within the meaning
of Art. VI, cl. 2;
(2) whether the question as to the waging of an agressive "war"
is in the context of this criminal prosecution a justiciable question:
(3) whether the Vietnam episode is a "war" in the sense of the
Treaty;
(4) whether petitioner has standing to raise the question;
(5) whether, if he has, it may be tendered as a defense in this crim-
inal case or in amelioration of the punishment.
These are extremely sensitive and delicate questions. But they
should, I think, be answered. Even those who think that the Nurem-
berg judgments were uncontitutional by our guarantee relating to ex
post facto laws would have to take a different view of the Treaty of
London that purports to lay down a standard of future conduct for
all the signatories.
I intimate no opinion on the merits. But I think the petition for
certiorari should be granted. We have here a recurring question in
present-day Selective Service cases.
No. 1027. Roy D. Thomas, petitioner, v. United States. Petition
for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the
Fifth Circuit denied. Mr. Justice Douglas dissents:
I would grant this petition on the fourth question. It concerns the
apparent practice of Internal Revenue agents in examining taxpayers
and using the evidence obtained in criminal prosecutions when the
taxpayers are given no warning as to their rights, including the right
to have an attorney present. This is not an in-custody case, but it

manner in respect to this defendant fulfilling his duty under this order.”

No. 981. Sidney Felber, petitioner, v. The Association of the Bar
of the City of New York. Petition for writ of certiorari to the
Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of New York, First Judicial
Department, denied. Mr. Justice Black dissents with whom Mr.
Justice Douglas joins:
Petitioner, a lawyer, was automatically disbarred in 1941 solely on
the basis of a trial court's conviction for larceny and forgery. This
conviction was held void and set aside by an appellate court which
finally ended the criminal case. After dismissal of the criminal case,
petitioner moved for reinstatement to the Bar. The matter was re-
ferred to a referee, who, relying on the same testimony which the
appellate court held could not legally support petitioner's conviction,
denied reinstatement. In so doing, the referee expressly noted that
petitioner had the burden of proving that he was morally fit for re-
admission to the Bar, although the burden of proof would have been
on the Bar in making an original charge against a lawyer. The Ap-
pellate Division accepted the referee's recommendation, and the Court
of Appeals denied petitioner permission to appeal on the ground that
the judgment lacked "finality.” On three subsequent occasions peti-
tioner again moved for reinstatement, but each time was turned down
by the Appellate Division without an opinion and denied permission
to appeal by the Court of Appeals on the ground of no "final judg-
ment," although it has disbarred him for 25 years. On the last occa-
sion petitioner presented the state courts with the constitutional issues
which he now urges this Court to review and decide in his favor.
For over 25 years petitioner has been unable to pursue his vocation
because of a void criminal conviction, a manifest distortion of justice.
The question presented is whether the State, having disbarred peti-
tioner automatically on the basis of a conviction for crime subsequently
voided, can perpetuate his disbarment on the basis of the identical evi-
dence offered to convict him. There are at least two reasons why the
State should not be allowed to do this. First, the moment petition-
er's conviction was reversed, his continued disbarment was supported
by absolutely no evidence. This was a clear deprivation of due process
of law and made the disbarment at that time as void as the criminal

conviction. Konigsberg v. State Bar, 353 U.S. 252; see Thompson v.
City of Louisville, 362 U.S. 199. Second, it is no answer to suggest, as
does respondent, that this denial of due process was somehow remedied
when the referee, after a hearing, denied petitioner's motion for rein-
statement. This shifted to petitioner the burden to prove his in-
nocence, because in New York there is apparently a tremendous differ-
ence between defending a disbarment charge and prosecuting a mo-
tion for reinstatement to the Bar. Where the Bar prosecutes for dis-
barment, the burden of proof is on the Bar Association; but where,
as here, the lawyer asks reinstatement, the burden of proof is on him.
Moreover, when a lawyer is initially disbarred, he may appeal the
Appellate Division's decision to the Court of Appeals; but when a
lawyer's motion for reinstatement is denied, the Court of Appeals
is without jurisdiction to hear an appeal because the denial is not a
"final judgment." Thus, for 25 years (long enough one would think
to be final) the Court of Appeals has refused to review the orders
denying petitioner readmission to the Bar. There may be valid rea-
sons for fastening greater procedural burdens on a disbarred lawyer
seeking reinstatement than on a lawyer defending a disbarment action.
But where the difference in status, as here, is solely attributable to a
void conviction for crime, the difference in treatment is itself viola-
tive of equal protection and further aggravates the initial deprivation
of due process, a disbarment based on no evidence.
For these reasons I dissent from the denial of certiorari in this case.

Petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for

certiorari should be granted.
No. 750. Salvatore Granello et al., petitioners, v. United States.
Petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit denied. Mr. Justice Brennan took no part in
the consideration or decision of this petition. Mr. Justice Douglas
dissents:
There are two issues in this case, relating to entirely separate events.
The first concerns the seizure of a lawyer's documents in Pennsylvania
by the police from the premises where the lawyer stored them. If we
assume that the premises were unlawfully raided by the police, a
client's paper seized and used against the client in a criminal prosecu-
tion, does the client have standing to move to suppress the evidence?
Whether petitioners were clients and Birrell their attorney are ques-
tions not fully resolved. But I think they are entitled to a hearing on
the issue and on the legality of the search. I cannot, as of now, believe
that if a lawyer-client relation is shown and if the search were held
to be illegal, the client is without standing to move for suppression of
the evidence. The dimensions of the problem are so great in the set-
ting of the Fourth Amendment and our enveloping regime of police
surveillance, that we should put the case down for argument. Another
issue, mentioned by my Brother FORTAS, relates to electronic surveil-
lance conducted in Florida. On that, we should at least remand the
case for findings on electronic surveillance as suggested by my Brother
FORTAS in whose opinion I concur-without prejudice of course to the
search and seizure question.
Mr. Justice Fortas dissents with whom the Chief Justice joins:
It is my opinion that certiorari should be granted and the case
remanded for a hearing in the District Court with respect to the
electronic surveillance which the Solicitor General has revealed to us.
According to the Solicitor General, agents of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation on or about May 11, 1962, surreptitiously and by
trespass installed an electronic listening device in a "commercial
establishment in Florida owned by an acquaintance of Levine and
in which Levine may have had a proprietary interest." The device
was in operation for nearly one year. During that time a number
of conversations in which Levine participated were overhead. Some
of those conversations were between Levine and attorneys represent-
ing him in prosecutions for interstate transport of counterfeit secu-
rities and for stock and mail fraud, matters then pending in a federal
court in Florida.
The Solicitor General represents that this violation of petitioner
Levine's constitutional rights had no connection with the present case,

MONDAY, APRIL 24, 1967
350
which involves a prosecution in New York for failure to file income tax
returns for 1956 and 1957. He says that it originated in connection
with an FBI investigation relating to the charges for which petitioner
Levine was tried and convicted in Florida. See Rogers v. United
States, 334 F. 2d 83 (C.A. 5th Cir.), cert. denied, 380 U.S. 915; Grad-
sky v. United States, 342 F. 2d 147 (C.A. 5th Cir.), vacated and re-
manded sub. nom. Levine v. United States, 383 U.S. 265. The Govern-
ment represents that nothing was overheard which had anything to do
with the present criminal tax case, and that neither the Internal Rev-
enue Service nor prosecuting counsel was apprised of the existence of
the surveillance. The Solicitor General says that petitioner Levine
will be furnished with the logs so that he may take whatever action is
appropriate in the District Court in Florida relating to the convictions
obtained in that court.
It is entirely possible, perhaps even probable, that the Solicitor Gen-
eral's representations will be validated, and it may be that no reason
will be developed for invalidating the present convictions because of
the trespassory espionage or its fruits. But this is "dirty business."
Olmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 470 (1928) (dissenting opin-
ion of Mr. Justice Holmes). It is important enough for the Solicitor
General to call to our attention. And an appraisal of the material and
the circumstances by defense counsel may adduce facts affecting the
weight to be given the unlawful operation which would never occur
to the prosecutor. The prosecutorial eye is, after all, apt to yield an
out-of-focus picture, as is the eye of the defense. But in our system we
insist upon the perspective developed by both. See Dennis v. United
States, 384 U.S. 855, 875 (1966). In any event, the facts, circum-
stances, yield, and fruits of the electronic surveillance should be ex-
posed in the record of this case so that we may, at least, be sure that
the Government's trespassory surveillance has not infected the trial
of these petitioners. Cf. O'Brien v. United States, U.S. (No.
823 this Term); Schipani v. United States, 385 U.S. 372 (1966);
Black v. United States, 385 U.S. 26 (1966).

manded to the Court of Appeals with directions to enforce the order
of the National Labor Relations Board. Opinion by Mr. Chief Justice
Warren. Dissenting opinion by Mr. Justice Harlan with whom Mr.
Justice Stewart joins.
The Chief Justice said:
"This being the final session of the 1966 Term which represents 18
years of service on the Court by Mr. Justice Clark, and because this
is his last session with us, the Court believes that we should not ad-
journ without taking note of his departure.
"Under ordinary circumstances, I would say that we approach his
retirement with great regret, but realizing the happy circumstances
which bring about his retirement I can only say that we view his depar-
ture with mixed feelings.
"Justice Clark has had a great public career. He graduated from the
Law School of the University of Texas in his native State in 1922, and
practiced law, both publicly and privately, for 15 years, until he en-
tered the Department of Justice as a Special Assistant in 1937. He
rose rapidly in the ranks of the Department, and scaled the entire
echelon until he finally became Attorney General of the United States
in 1945. Having served with distinction, he was appointed to the Su-
preme Court by President Truman in 1949. For 18 years he has served
with distinction on this Court. During those dynamic years he wrote
many of the most important opinions of the times.
"He has been a great companion for us, and he departs with the affec-
tion of every member of the Court. We are happy to know that he
leaves in the best of health and for a happy reason. We have no idea
what he will undertake to do in the future, but we know that he will be
active, and that he will continue throughout his useful years, which we
hope will be many, to devote his efforts to the improvement of the
administration of justice.
Mr. Justice Clark said:
"Mr. Chief Justice and my brother Associate Justices:
"You have been most generous in your statement, Mr. Chief Justice,
for which I am deeply grateful. If my Father were here he would
chuckle-perhaps laugh-at hearing such a eulogy; but if my Mother
were here, she would believe every word of it, and love it!
"My eighteen years' service on the Court has been the most reward-
ing of my public life. To two great Presidents I am grateful for giving
me this opportunity. First, to Franklin Delano Roosevelt for bringing
me into the Department of Justice in 1937 and appointing me Assist-

ant Attorney General in 1943; and, the more am I indebted to the best
client of my life, President Harry S. Truman, for whom I served as
Attorney General of the United States.
"And let me also thank each of my present colleagues on the bench
for their most helpful and cooperative assistance; and also those who
are gone but with whom I was privileged to have served, one of whom,
Justice Reed, I see in the courtroom today. And, to my law clerks—all
36 and many of whom are here today-I am appreciative of their dili-
gent, effective and devoted service; and to my loyal secretary of almost
a quarter of a century, Miss Alice O'Donnell, I give my grateful
thanks. If I have accomplished any of the things which you enumer-
ated, Mr. Chief Justice, it has been due to Mary, my dear wife whose
love and devotion has been my inspiration.
"Today our emotions are mixed-happiness with regrets. But it is
not the last day of which I speak, it is rather the first day of the new
life which we shall continue to dedicate to the public interest. As we
enter it and close our 18 years here-we call to mind the words of
the Court Crier: 'God bless the United States and this Honorable
Court.""
The Chief Justice said:
"Also, because this is the last session of our 1966 Term, we should
tarry long enough to take notice of another significance the day has for
us. It represents the completion of thirty years of service on this Court.
by Mr. Justice Black. Only eight other Justices in the long history
of the Court have achieved such a record and none in a more dynamic
period or with greater distinction. In this long period, he has written
hundreds of important opinions that in the aggregate constitute a
monumental part of the jurisprudence of the Court.
"As he passes this milestone, we all wish for him continued good
health and happiness."
The Chief Justice said:
"The other orders of the Court have been certified by the Chief
Justice filed with the Clerk and will not be announced orally."
