Order: It is ordered that the rules of this court be amended as

RULE 6.
Strike out section 2 and insert the following:
"2. Forty-five minutes on each side shall be allowed to the argu-
ment of a motion, and no more, without special leave of the court,
granted before the argument begins."
Strike out section 5 and insert the following:
"5. The court in any pending cause will receive a motion to affirm
on the ground that it is manifest that the writ or appeal was taken
for delay only, or that the questions on which the decision of the
cause depend are so frivolous as not to need further argument. The
same procedure shall apply to and control such motions as are pro-
vided for in cases of motions to dismiss under paragraph 4 of this
rule. Although the court upon consideration of a motion to affirm
may refuse to grant the motion, it may nevertheless, if the conclusion
is arrived at that the case is of such a character as not to justify ex-
tended argument, order the cause transferred for hearing to a sum-
mary docket. The hearing of the causes on such docket will be
expedited, the court providing from time to time for such speedy dis-
position of the docket as the regular order of business may permit,
and on the hearing of such causes one-half hour will be allowed each
side for oral argument."
RULE 22.
Strike out section 3 and insert the following:
"3. One and one-half hours on each side will be allowed for the
argument, and no more, without special leave of the court, granted
before the argument begins. But in cases certified from the Circuit
Court of Appeals, cases involving solely the jurisdiction of the court
below, and cases under the act of March 2, 1907 (34 Stat., 1246), 45
minutes only on each side will be allowed for the argument, unless
the time be extended. The time thus allowed may be apportioned
between the counsel on the same side at their discretion: Provided
always, That a fair opening of the case shall be made by the party
having the opening and closing arguments."

1. One who is not a party to a record and judgment is not entitled
to appeal therefrom. Bayard v. Lombard (9 How., 530); Indiana
v. Liverpool, London & Globe Ins. Co. (109 U. S., 168). Ex parte
Cockcroft (104 U. S., 578).
2. The action of the court below in refusing to permit the movers
to become parties to the record is not susceptible of being reviewed
by this Court on appeal, or indirectly, under the circumstances here
disclosed, by the writ of mandamus. In re Cutting (94 U. S., 15),
and see Credits Commutation Co. v. United States (177 U. S., 311).

the movers allege they have in the papers here filed is not in any

assail the action of the court below. This is more obvious in this
case since the act of the court which is assailed has been accepted

MONDAY, JANUARY 8, 1912.
Present: Mr. Justice McKenna, Mr. Justice Holmes, Mr. Justice
Lurton, Mr. Justice Hughes, Mr. Justice Van Devanter, and Mr.
Justice Lamar.
Mr. Justice McKenna said:
"I will say to the gentlemen of the Bar that the Chief Justice is
detained at home, and I will read a statement prepared by him:
666
6‘Mrs. Day, wife of Mr. Justice Day, died on Friday afternoon at
their home in Canton, Ohio.
""When we assembled for the commencement of the term, Mr. Jus-
tice Day was absent, and we learned that he was prevented from coming
by the illness of Mrs. Day. We soon came further to know the seri-
ous character of that illness and the ever-present dread which existed
that any moment it might terminate fatally. Indeed, during the time
which has elapsed our sympathy has gone out to our brother in the
cruel and relentless anguish with which he has been incessantly encom-
passed, ending in the dread bereavement which has come to him.
"The funeral services take place at Canton this afternoon. Were it
possible, we should attend the ceremonies in a body, and to enable us
to do so would adjourn for the day. Unable to be present, however,
we shall yet in spirit be there. As a manifestation of our participa-
tion in spirit in the ceremonies, and as a mark of our sorrow and
affection for the living and respect and tenderness for the memory of
the dead, we shall transact no business to-day, but will adjourn until
to-morrow morning.””
Adjourned until to-morrow at 12 o'clock.
The day call for Tuesday, January 9, will be as follows: Nos. 607

Mr. Attorney General Wickersham presented the following resolu-
tions:
"Resolved, That the members of the bar of the Supreme Court of
the United States record their profound appreciation of the life and
labors which were brought to a close by the death of Mr. Justice
Harlan.
"He was dedicated at his birth to the profession of the law by his
father, who was himself an honored and distinguished member of that
profession, and prophecy of a personal career was never more com-
pletely fulfilled than that which spoke in the christening of John Mar-
shall Harlan. He came into an heroic epoch of American history and,
mentally and physically, was cast in an heroic mold. In his earliest
manhood he entered upon the practice of his profession and at the
same time took part in the political controversies by which the country
was then deeply disturbed and which nowhere tried the mettle of
American manhood more than in that borderland of contention, of
which his native State of Kentucky was a part, and when the discussion
of the hustings and of legislative halls proved unequal to the settle-
ment of the problems he met the full measure of patriotic duty by
responding to the call to arms and sharing in the perils and privations
which an appeal to the arbitrament of war made necessary. Return-
ing, after distinguished service in the field, to the practice of his pro-
fession, he continued his interest and his efforts in behalf of the pub-
lic welfare, and in the contests of politics was a willing leader of the
forces which held his faith alike, whether the prospect was of victory
or of defeat.
66
Disciplined by the experiences of civil and military life and by the
duties of public and private station he came, in the full maturity of his
powers, to this tribunal, whose broad jurisdiction imposes upon its
members responsibilities as serious as can rest upon the conscience of
man. For nearly 34 years he honored his high position by faithful
discharge of its duties. The record of his service is to be found in
| 126 volumes of reported cases in the determination of which, with few
exceptions, he participated. In 700 cases he wrote the opinion of the
court, and in many others he wrote opinions, sometimes of concurrence,
for reasons separately stated, and sometimes of radical dissent, but
whether he spoke for others or only for himself, and whether in assent
or in dissent, it was always in the language of honest and earnest
conviction.
"Personal and property rights, individual and corporate interests,
the reciprocal relations of citizen, state, and nation, in ever-changing
phases presented themselves as subjects for adjudication. Indifferent
in no instance, there was, however, an especial appeal to him in cases
involving those rights of the individual which it was the purpose of
the amendments to the Federal Constitution to secure, and he sup-

118
ported the national authority in its fullest scope as the sure means of
maintaining those rights.
"His style proclaimed the man. It was simple, direct, strong, and
rugged. His opinions are supported by abundant authority, but
make no vain display of learning, and of their meaning there is no
room for doubt.
"Virile and masterful, his strength was subdued to a conscience
sensitive to right, and his purposes were shaped by a character of
perfect integrity. Throughout the many years that fell to his part,
as a man, citizen, soldier, and judge, he kept without stain the name
he bore and which he cherished as the guide and inspiration of his
life.
66
Resolved, That the Attorney General be requested to present
these resolutions to the court for entry upon the record, and that the
chairman of the meeting be directed to send to the family of Justice
Harlan a copy of the resolutions with an expression of our sympathy
for them in the loss they have sustained."
The Attorney General then said:
"May it please the court, on the first page of the tenth volume of
Peters' Reports of the decisions of this court is recorded the fact that
John Marshall, its Chief Justice, died at Philadelphia on the 6th day
of July, 1835, and, in a brief minute, it is added:
666
"His judgments upon great and important constitutional ques-
tions, affecting the safety, the tranquillity, and the permanency of the
Government of his beloved country-his decisions on international and
general law, distinguished by their learning, integrity, and accuracy,
are recorded in the reports of the cases adjudged in the Supreme
Court of the United States, in which he presided during a period of
34 years.'
"This simple bald recital of the services of the great expounder of
our Constitution concludes with these words:
666
"As long as the Constitution and laws shall endure and have
authority, these will be respected, regarded, and maintained.'
"Perhaps by no other member of this court have these decisions
been more highly respected, regarded, and maintained than by John
Marshall Harlan, the Associate Justice of this court, who departed this
life on October 14, 1911, after a length of service nearly coincident
with that of the great judge whose name he bore.
"Mr. Justice Harlan was born in Boyle County, Ky., on January
1, 1833. His commission as an Associate Justice of this court is
dated November 29, 1877, and he took the oath of office on December
10 of that year, being then little more than 44 years of age.
"His first recorded opinion is that in National Bank v. Insurance
Company (95 U. S., 673). His last opinion expressing the judgment
of the court is that in Northern Pacific Railway Company v. Trodick

་
119
(221 U. S., 208), rendered May 15, 1911. In the same volume is
recorded his very last written opinion, delivered two weeks later, in
the case of United States v. American Tobacco Company, concurring
in part and in part dissenting from the opinion of the court.
"The records of his activities as a justice of this court during the
34 years of his service are, therefore, to be found in the 126 volumes
of its published opinions, from the ninety-fifth to the two hundred
and twenty-first, and they cover the entire range of subjects which
have come before this court during all those years. From the first
to the last, these opinions breathe what Lowell called the 'brave old
wisdom of sincerity.'
"Justice Harlan was born, educated, and came to manhood in Ken-
tucky, then a border State. His father, James Harlan, was a Whig,
a devoted friend of Henry Clay, an admirer of Webster, and an earn-
est believer in the principles of constitutional law as expounded by
Marshall. He intended his son to be a lawyer and, in the expression
of his hopes, he named him John Marshall. The future justice was
brought up in the school of thought represented by Marshall, Web-
ster, and Clay. He began to take part in political affairs when he
was but 20. He was elected county judge of Franklin County when
25. He was an elector on the Bell and Everett ticket, which carried
Kentucky in 1860. He threw himself actively into the controversy
which developed into civil war in 1861 and, together with James
Speed, Attorney General of the United States under Mr. Lincoln,
labored successfully to prevent Kentucky from joining the Confed-
eracy. In July, 1861, he was commissioned captain of a company of
Zouaves. His military service lasted until the death of his father in
1863, when, upon resigning his military commission, he was elected
attorney general of his State. He continued active in political affairs
and, in 1877, was one of the commissioners charged with settling cer-
tain disputes which threatened to disturb the peace of the State of
Louisiana. In December of that year President Hayes appointed
him an Associate Justice of this court.
"Perhaps the fact that his native State was divided in the great con-
test of 1861-1865 lent a greater intensity to Justice Harlan's convic-
tions concerning the true meaning and correct interpretation of the
Constitution than he might otherwise have felt, and inclined him
to a construction which gave to the National Government the
maximum power which the language of the fundamental law would
permit. The Constitution and the Bible were the objects of his con-
stant thought and consideration, and if the latter was to him always
vox Dei the former, vox populi, was no less so. His opinions were
expressed in forceful and vigorous language, and his convictions upon
questions of public policy which were involved in the decision of
cases in which he wrote, blazed out in language whose meaning ad-

120
mitted of no doubt. When he did not agree with his brethren, he said
so in unmistakable terms.
"He was impatient of a construction which limited what he believed
to be the intention of the people in adopting the war amendments to
the Constitution and which thwarted the entire equalization of the
negro with the white man in all political and public relations. He
expressed the judgment of the court in Neal v. Delaware (103 U. S.,
370), where it was held that the adoption of the fifteenth amendment
rendered inoperative a provision in the then existing constitution of
the State of Delaware, whereby the right of suffrage was limited to the
white race, and that a statute of the State, confining the selection of
jurors to persons possessing the qualifications of electors was enlarged
in its operation so as to embrace all those who, by the constitution of
the State as modified by the fifteenth amendment, were entitled to
vote.
"But in the Civil Rights cases (109 U. S.) he vigorously dissented
from the view taken by the majority of the court respecting the civil
rights act of March 1, 1875, contending that their opinion proceeded
'upon grounds entirely too narrow and artificial.'
"I can not resist,' he said, 'the conclusion that the substance and
spirit of the recent amendments of the Constitution have been sacri-
ficed by a subtle and ingenious verbal criticism. "It is not the words
of the law but the internal sense of it that makes the law; the letter
of the law is the body; the sense and reason of the law is the soul."
Constitutional provisions adopted in the interest of liberty and for
the purpose of securing, through national legislation, if need be,
rights inhering in a state of freedom and belonging to American citi-
zenship have been so construed as to defeat the ends the people desire
to accomplish, which they attempted to accomplish, and which they
supposed they had accomplished by changes in their fundamental law.
By this I do not mean that the determination of these cases should.
have been materially controlled by considerations of mere expediency
of policy; I mean only, in this form, to express an earnest conviction
that the court has departed from the familiar rule requiring, in the
interpretation of constitutional provisions, that full effect be given to
the intent with which they were adopted.'
"Again, in Plessy v. Ferguson (163 U. S., 537) he dissented, with
equal vigor, from the decision which sustained the constitutionality of
an act of the Legislature of Louisiana requiring railway companies
carrying passengers in their coaches in that State to provide equal, but
separate, accommodations for the white and colored races.
"The sure guarantee of the peace and security of each race,' he
wrote, 'is the clear, distinct, unconditional recognition by our govern-
ments, national and State, of every right that inheres in civil free-
dom, and of the equality before the law of all citizens of the United

121
States without regard to race. State enactments regulating the enjoy-
ment of civil rights, upon the basis of race, and cunningly devised to
defeat legitimate results of the war, under the pretense of recognizing
equality of rights, can have no other result than to render permanent
peace impossible and to keep alive a conflict of races, the continuance
of which must do harm to all concerned. This question is not met by
the suggestion that social equality can not exist between the white and
black races in this country. That argument, if it can properly be
regarded as one, is scarcely worthy of consideration, for social equality
no more exists between two races when traveling in a passenger coach
or a public highway than when members of the same races sit by
each other in a street car or in the jury box, or stand or sit with each
other in a political assembly, or when they use in common the streets
of a city or town, or when they are in the same room for the purpose
of having their names placed on the registry of voters, or when they
approach the ballot box in order to exercise the high privilege of
voting.'
"In Hodges v. United States (203 U. S., 1) he dissented from the
decision of the majority that the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments
to the Constitution operate solely on State action and not on individual
action, and that the remedy for wrongs committed by individuals on
persons of African descent is through State action and State tribunals,
subject to supervision of this court by writ of error in proper cases;
and that, consequently, the United States district courts have no juris-
diction under the thirteenth amendment or sections 1978, 1979, 5508,
or 5510, Revised Statutes, of a charge of conspiracy made and carried
out in a State to prevent citizens of African descent, because of their
race and color, from making or carrying out contracts and agreements
to labor.
"He protested against the decision in Hurtado v. People of Cali-
fornia (110 U. S., 516) that the words 'due process of law' in the
fourteenth amendment do not necessarily require an indictment by a
grand jury in a prosecution by a State for murder, contending that
'due process of law,' within the meaning of the National Constitution,
does not import one thing with reference to the powers of the State
and another with reference to the powers of the General Government.
"My brethren concede,' he wrote, 'that there are principles of
liberty and justice lying at the foundation of our civil and political
institutions which no State can violate consistently with that due
process of law required by the fourteenth amendment in proceedings
involving life, liberty, or property. Some of these principles are
enumerated in the opinion of the court. But for reasons which do not
impress my mind as satisfactory they exclude from that enumeration
the exemption from prosecution, by information, for a public offense
involving life.
* * *

122
"It is said by the court that the Constitution of the United States
was made for an undefined and expanding future, and that its require-
ment of due process of law in proceedings involving life, liberty, and
property must be so interpreted as not to deny to the law the capacity
of progress and improvement; that the greatest security for the
fundamental principles of justice resides in the right of the people to
make their own laws and alter them at pleasure. It is difficult, how-
ever, to perceive anything in the system of prosecuting human beings
for their lives, by information, which suggests that the State which
adopts it has entered upon an era of progress and improvement in the
law of criminal procedure.'
"He concurred with the majority of the court in De Lima v. Bide-
well (182 U. S., 1) in holding that territory (in this case Porto Rico)
acquired by the United States by cession from a foreign power is not
foreign country' within the meaning of the tariff laws. But in
Downes v. Bidwell (182 U. S., 245) he was one of the justices who
agreed with the Chief Justice in dissenting from the conclusion that,
after its cession to the United States by Spain, the island of Porto Rico
was not a part of the United States within that provision of the Con-
stitution which declares that all duties, imposts, and excises shall be
uniform throughout the United States.'
"In Hawaii v. Mankichi (190 U. S., 197), again dissenting from
the majority of the court, he maintained that, after the annexation of
Hawaii and before the passage of the act of Congress providing a
government for that Territory, a conviction for manslaughter upon an
indictment not found by a grand jury and by the verdict of 9 only out
of 12 jurors, in accordance with the laws of Hawaii in force at the
time of annexation, could not be legal.
"But if he was strong and vigorous in dissent, he was equally so
in voicing the conclusions of the majority of the court. The vigorous
line of opinions dealing with the power of the Federal Government
over interstate commerce are the best examples of the strength of his
convictions and the lucidity of his reasoning in constitutional exposi-
tion. In them the principles of Marshall's interpretation of the
Constitution were fully recognized and applied. In the Lottery case
(188 U. S., 321) he demonstrated the proposition that legislation,
under the power to regulate commerce among the several States, may
sometimes properly assume the form or have the effect of prohibition,
and that Congress, under this power, might prohibit the carriage of
lottery tickets from one State to another. In Minnesota v. Barber
(136 U. S., 313) he wrote the decision holding to be unconstitutional
a statute of the State of Minnesota which prohibited the sale in
the State of fresh beef, veal, pork, etc., for human food, unless
the animals from which taken should have been inspected within
that State before being slaughtered. In a series of forceful opin-

123
ions, the last of which was written at the very close of his life, he
upheld the right of corporations to engage in interstate commerce
without interference or restriction by State authority. These opin-
ions illustrate the supprising freshness and vigor of Justice Harlan's
mind. In Western Union Telegraph Company v. Kansas (216 U. S.,
1), and in Pullman Company v. Kansas (216 U. S., 56), it was held
that the right to carry on interstate commerce is not a privilege
granted by the States, but a constitutional right of every citizen of
the United States; that the Congress alone can limit the right of cor-
porations to engage therein, and that no State may impose, as a con-
dition of carrying on interstate commerce within its borders, a tax of a
given percentage of all the capital of a corporation, represented by its
business interests and property, everywhere, within and outside of the
State; that a corporation organized in one State and doing an inter-
state business, is not bound to obtain the permission of another State
to transact business within its limits, but can go into the latter for the
purpose of interstate business, although subject to reasonable legal
regulations for the safety, comfort, and convenience of the people,
which do not, in a real substantial sense burden or regulate its inter-
state business, nor subject its other property and interests, outside of
the State, to taxation. In the case of the International Textbook
Company v. Pigg (217 U. S., 91), he applied these principles, in a most
interesting and lucid manner, to the case of a Pennsylvania corpora-
tion engaged in furnishing instruction, by correspondence with students
in various States.
" 'It is true,' he said, 'that the business in which the International
Textbook Co. is engaged is of a somewhat exceptional character, but,
in our judgment, it was in its essential characteristics, commerce
among the States within the meaning of the Constitution of the United.
States. It involved, as already suggested, regular and practically
continuous intercourse between the Textbook Co., located in Penn-
sylvania, and its scholars and agents in Kansas and other States. That
intercourse was conducted by means of correspondence through the
mails with such agents and scholars. While this mode of imparting
and acquiring an education may not be such as is commonly adopted
* *
in this country, it is a lawful mode to accomplish the valuable pur-
pose the parties have in view.
* Intercourse of that kind,
between parties in different States-particularly when it is in execu-
tion of a valid contract between them-is as much intercourse, in the
constitutional sense, as intercourse by means of the telegraph—“a
new species of commerce," to use the words of this court in Pensacola
Telegraph Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 96, U. S. 1, 9.'
66
While always asserting with vigor the supremacy of Federal
control over interstate commerce, he yet wrote the opinion of the
court in the case of Hennington v. Georgia (163 U. S., 299), holding

124
valid statutes of the State of Georgia which forbade the running of
freight trains on any railroad in that State on Sunday, upon the
ground that, while such legislation affected interstate commerce in a
limited degree, it was not, for that reason, a needless intrusion upon
the domain of Federal jurisdiction, and would be respected by the
Federal courts until superseded and displaced by some act of Con-
gress, passed in exclusion of the power to regulate commerce granted
by the Constitution. Where the people of a State deem it necessary
to their peace, comfort, and happiness, to say nothing of the public
health and the public morals, that one day in each week be set apart
by law as a day when business of all kinds carried on within the limits
of that State shall cease, whereby all persons of every race and condi-
tion in life may have an opportunity to enjoy absolute rest and quiet,
that result, he said, speaking for the court, was obtainable by State
legislation, which would be valid until Congress should occupy the
field by some inconsistent provision of law.
"In an opinion remarkable for learning and research, in the case of
Sparf and Hansen v. United States (156 U. S., 51), he expressed the
judgment of the court that, in the courts of the United States, it is
the duty of the jury, in criminal cases, to receive the law from the
court and to apply it as given by the court, subject to the condition
that, by a general verdict, a jury, of necessity, determined both law
and fact as compounded in the issues submitted to them in a particular
He summed up the argument in these words:
case.
""We must hold firmly to the doctrine that in the courts of the
United States it is the duty of juries in criminal cases to take the law
from the court and apply that law to the facts as they find them to be
from the evidence. Upon the court rests the responsibility of declar-
ing the law; upon the jury the responsibility of applying the law so
declared to the facts as they upon their conscience believe them to be.
Under any other system the courts, although established in order to
declare the law, would for every practical purpose be eliminated from
our system of government as instrumentalities devised for the protec-
tion equally of society and of individuals in their essential rights.
When that occurs our Government will cease to be a government of
laws and become a government of men. Liberty regulated by law is
the underlying principle of our institutions.'
"It would prolong this address far beyond the proper limits of this
occasion to continue much further the review of Justice Harlan's many
contributions to the records of the court during his service of more
than one-third of a century. Yet no review of his services would be
adequate which failed to refer to his participation in the construction
and enforcement of the law against unlawful restraints upon inter-
state commerce and monopolies. Strongly individual in his views and
22984-12-63

125
in his characteristics, he was keenly sympathetic with the widespread
public dread of the effect upon individualism of the tendencies toward
concentration of control over great industries, and the creation of
monopolistic combinations which found expression in the now famous
Sherman Act of 1890. When the court upon the presentation of the
facts in the Knight case (156 U. S., 1) held that act to be ineffective in
checking monoply at its inception, and powerless in the face of the
acquisition by a great corporation of 98 per cent of all the manufac-
tories in the United States of a commodity of common necessity, his
dissent was expressed in vigorous language.
"If this combination,' he wrote, 'so far as its operations neces-
sarily or directly affect interstate commerce, can not be restrained or
suppressed under some power granted to Congress, it will be cause for
regret that the patriotic statesmen who framed the Constitution did
not foresee the necessity of investing the National Government with
power to deal with gigantic monopolies, holding in their grasp and
injuriously controlling in their own interest the entire trade among
the States in food products that are essential to the comfort of every
household in the land.

"Undoubtedly the preservation of the just authority of the States
is an object of deep concern to every lover of his country. No greater
calamity could befall our free institutions than the destruction of that
authority, by whatever means such a result might be accomplished.
*
**But it is equally true that the preservation of the just
authority of the General Government is essential as well to the safety
of the States as to the attainment of the important ends for which that
Government was ordained by the people of the United States, and the
destruction of that authority would be fatal to the peace and well-being
of the American people' (p. 19).

"There is no dispute here as to the lawfulness of the business of
refining sugar, apart from the undue restraint which the promoters of
such business who have combined to control prices seek to put upon
the freedom of interstate traffic in that article.
"It may be admitted that an act which did nothing more than
forbid, and which had no other object than to forbid, the mere refining
of sugar in any State would be in excess of any power granted to
Congress. But the act of 1880 is not of that character. It does not
strike at the manufacture simply of articles that are legitimate or
recognized subjects of commerce, but at combinations that unduly
restrain, because they monopolize the buying and selling of articles
which are to go into interstate commerce' (p. 34).
"He summed up the discussion in these words:
"""Whatever improperly obstructs the free course of interstate inter-
course and trade, as involved in the buying and selling of articles to

126
be carried from one State to another, may be reached by Congress
under its authority to regulate commerce among the States. The exer-
cise of that authority so as to make trade among the States in all
recognized articles of commerce absolutely free from unreasonable or
illegal restrictions imposed by combinations is justified by an express
grant of power to Congress, and would redound to the welfare of the
whole country. I am unable to perceive that any such result would
imperil the autonomy of the States, especially as that result can not be
attained through the action of any one State.
"Undue restrictions or burdens upon the purchasing of goods in
the market for sale, to be transported to other States, can not be im-
posed even by a State without violating the freedom of commercial
intercourse guaranteed by the Constitution. But if a State within
whose limits the business of refining sugar is exclusively carried on
may not constitutionally impose burdens upon purchases of sugar to
be transported to other States, how comes it that combinations of cor-
porations or individuals within the same State may not be prevented
by the National Government from putting unlawful restraints upon
the purchasing of that article to be carried from the State in which
such purchases are made?' (pp. 37–38).
"Mr. Justice Harlan wrote the opinion in the Northern Securities
case (193 U. S., 197), which was concurred in by three other justices,
and in which the conclusions reached were agreed to by Mr. Justice
Brewer in an opinion expressing his dissent from the statement of some
of the propositions set forth by Mr. Justice Harlan with his accus-
tomed vigor. The case presented was the acquisition by a New Jersey
corporation of the control of the capital stocks of two competing trans-
continental railroad systems. The majority of the court held that the
acquisition by the Securities Company, through such stock ownership,
of the power to prevent or restrain competition between the companies
brought the case within the statute. Justice Harlan, in the argument
to sustain the conclusion reached, contended that every combination
or conspiracy which would extinguish competition between otherwise
competing railroads engaged in interstate trade or commerce, and
which would in that way restrain such trade or commerce, is made
illegal by the act which embraces all direct restraints imposed by any
combination, conspiracy, or monopoly upon such trade or commerce,
and was not limited in its effect to restraints that are unreasonable in
their nature.
"Justice Brewer, on the other hand, maintained that the correct
ruling in the case would have been that the contracts under considera-
tion were unreasonable restraints of interstate trade and as such
within the prohibition of the antitrust act.
"Justice Harlan wrote the opinion in Continental Wall Paper Co.
v. Voight (212 U. S., 227), which involved the right of a purchaser of

127
goods from a combination unlawful under the antitrust act to plead
such illegality in defense of his failure to pay for the goods. Hold-
ing that upon the facts admitted by the demurrer the plaintiff in
effect was seeking the aid of the court to enforce a contract for the
sale and purchase of goods which was in fact, and was intended to be,
based upon agreements that were parts of an illegal scheme―a scheme
based upon a combination intended and which would have the effect
directly to restrain and monopolize trade and commerce among the
several States and with foreign nations-Justice Harlan, speaking for
the majority of the court, held that the plaintiff could not have judg-
ment for the account sued on, because such judgment would in effect
aid the execution of the agreements which constituted the illegal
combination.
"In the decisions in the cases against the Standard Oil Company
(221 U. S., 1) and the Tobacco Combination (221 U. S., 106), Justice
Harlan, while concurring in the decisions, read opinions expressing
dissent from opinions which were concurred in by the other members
of the court, with respect to a part of the reasoning advanced in
support of the conclusions reached.
"Justice Harlan's individuality and his mental characteristics were
the results of heredity and early environment. Another Kentuckian
who attained fame in a very different line, writing in his autobiography
of experiences gained during three months' adventurous voyage in
Canadian waters, and speaking of the Canadian sailors whose courage
and fortitude in the face of hardship and danger had greatly impressed
him, says:
""These men taught me much of human nature. I found in them
the value of the common man as I probably should have found it
nowhere else; for it is so well hidden in our more organized societies
that many persons far more discerning than myself fail for all their
lives to see the meaning of ordinary life, and so fail to get the most
important teaching the world has to give. In a way, I had been pre-
pared for this coming revelation by my contact with the frontier type
of man in Kentucky. But at his best, the man of the forests and
plains can not compare with the seaman in the even, rounded culture
of human quality. As I had known him in Kentucky, he was a fine
fellow of the conquering type. He had beaten his brute and human
enemies and subjugated the wilderness; but he had never well learned
what it was to follow a leader, to put his life in his chief's hands in a
ceaseless war with a mastering deep.' (Autobiography of Nathaniel
Southgate Shaler, p. 165.)
"Justice Harlan was a refined example of the type of Kentuckian
referred to by Prof. Shaler. He had learned, in the fierce warfare
of personal strife during the Civil War, and in the intensity of polit-
ical contests after the war, to beat his brute and human enemies

128
as his fathers had learned to subjugate the wilderness. But he never
well learned what it was to follow a leader-at least not a living one.
He was a student and disciple of Marshall, but among living men he
could lead but he could not follow. Where others agreed with his
views he would march with them, but when they differed he marched
on alone. His was not the temper of the negotiator. Strong, vigor-
ous, self-confident, he stands out as the representative of a type which
has made the American character dominant among the nations."
The Chief Justice responded:
"Mr. Attorney General, your words go home to our hearts and the
resolutions of our brethren of the bar move us, since they show both
the confidence which the bar reposed in and the affection they bore
Mr. Justice Harlan, as well as the veneration they cherish for his
memory. The depth with which these feelings are by us shared and
the greatness of the sorrow which has come to us by the death of our
brother, can not be appreciated without understanding how completely
the discharge of judicial duty in a court of last resort necessitates an
effort by all to efface every merely incidental mental and moral
tendency to difference of opinion in order that by the perfect equi-
poise of mind with mind and the union of heart with heart, a compos-
ite, wise, and just judgment may result.
"The disintegration by death of the union resulting from such ties
of intimate and affectionate association brings with it not only bereave-
ment, but a sense of despondency, because of the fleeting and perish-
able result of all human efforts which it apparently exemplifies. The
contemplation, however, of the great life which we commemorate
dispels the miasma of despondency and calls us to the onward and
upward struggle for higher and holier things, since, when rightly
measured, the lessons of that life point to the continuing and enduring
result for good of duty conscientiously performed. Through the
mists of parting and the shadows of death itself, clearing our vision
by the light which that life affords, we are enabled to see how greatly
the dedication of the life of our Brother Harlan to the service of his
country, during his more than 34 years of judicial labor, serves to
sustain and to make fruitful for the benefit of all his countrymen the
power for good of that ideal and undying personality, the Supreme
Court of the United States, the offspring of the devotion of our fore-
fathers to human liberty and their genius to creating institutions for
its perpetuation. So noble in conception and yet so simple in execu-
tion; so ordinary in its incidents and yet so majestic as the servant of
the whole people; so weak and yet so strong, because founded upon
the affection of all the people and depending for its existence upon
their continued support.
"It would not be appropriate on this occasion, nor is there presently
time, Mr. Attorney General, to afford the opportunity to add to the

129
condensed statement which you have made of the career of Mr. Justice
Harlan by giving an outline of his services in peace and in war. I
shall, therefore, leaving the general subject to some more appropriate
occasion, seek only now to depict in the briefest manner some of the
most dominant of the moral and mental forces which characterized
Mr. Justice Harlan's discharge of judicial duty, as seen from the
angle of vision of those engaged with him in such duty, thus, perhaps,
speaking from a point of observation which, if not stated now, might
possibly pass out of view.
"In the first place, there was ever manifested the supreme importance
which he attached to the performance of his judicial work and the
consequent dedication which followed of every mental and moral
faculty of his being to the doing of that work. In the second place
there was likewise consequently manifested a purpose to do justice as
it was given him to see it, a justice not resting upon mere metaphysical
conceptions or distinctions of casuistry concerning the lines of sepa-
ration between right and wrong, but a justice based upon what
seemed to him to be a common sense of justice, begetting an ever-
present and vivid purpose to uphold the right and to frustrate the
the wrong and ever to see to it that the weak were not overmastered
by the strong. In the third place-and this was the most prominent
of all he possessed a reverence for and an implicit faith in our con-
stitutional institutions, a faith which knew no doubt and caused him
to believe that the power of adaptability of those institutions was
adequate to meet and provide for any possible condition, however
complex or novel. And as these dominant qualities were potential in
giving shape and form to his mental attributes, the latter in substance
were but the reflex of the former. His methods of thought, in disre-
gard of mere subtleties or refined distinctions, led him to the broadest
lines of conviction, and as those lines were by him discerned, and
differences between himself and others became impossible of recon-
ciliation, the warfare of mind with mind was by him carried on, not
with adroit fence or subtle play of reason, but with a directness and
entire disregard of all narrower points of view. This was particularly
observable with reference to his conclusions on questions concerning
powers of government arising from constitutional limitations and the
consideration of asserted violations of the rights of individuals pro-
tected by such limitations. Once his convictions were definitely
formed, so complete was his faith, so ardent was his devotion, so unal-
terable was his purpose to maintain and perpetuate in each and every
particular, as he understood it, the Government under the Constitution
which he so much loved, that sometimes the very ardor and zeal with
which, when he differed from others, the reason for his differences were
expounded, produced upon the merely superficial observer the impres-
sion that there was doubt on his part as to the power of the Constitu-

130
tion, if interpreted in conflict with the views which he held, to
successfully continue to accomplish the great purpose which it was
ordained to secure; but this was indeed a singularly mistaken view,
since it engendered doubt and weakness merely because of the forms
in which supreme and perfect faith had found their expression.
"It being true, as I have said, that the lessons afforded by the life
of the great American whose loss we commemorate and deplore afford
a correction of despondency and constitute an incentive, calling upon
all to dedicate their lives to a higher and completer fulfillment of duty,
why is it not also true that a right contemplation of that life and its
results will serve in some measure to assuage the feeling of sorrow
begotten by his death? It was given him to exceed the allotted span
of mortal existence and during his long and useful career to faithfully
serve, in war and in peace, his country; to win the affection of all his
countrymen; and to afford an elevating and noble example of duty
well and faithfully performed. Ah! contemplating that life, its sim-
plicity, its courage, its devotion to duty, its love of country, does
not the faith come to us that in the transition from things finite to
things infinite it has been given to him to hear the ineffable melody of
those words of benediction, the hope of hearing which has led so
many millions to consecrate their lives to the performance of duty
and the service of God and their country- Well done, thou good and
faithful servant.'
