SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Present: Chief Justice Burger, Justice Brennan, Justice Stewart,
Justice White, Justice Marshall, Justice Blackmun, Justice Powell,
and Justice Stevens.
The Chief Justice said:
"The Court is in special session this afternoon to receive the Resolu-
tions of the Bar in the Supreme Court in tribute to the late Justice
William O. Douglas."
Mr. Solicitor General McCree addressed the Court as follows:
"The members of the Bar of the Supreme Court of the United States
meet today to record our respect and admiration for William Orville
Douglas, who served with the greatest distinction as Associate Jus-
tice for 36 years and 6 months, longer than any Justice in the history
of the Court. In these Resolutions, we wish to memorialize his career
and contributions to the law and the jurisprudence of this Court.
I.
Justice Douglas was appointed to the Court by President Franklin
D. Roosevelt to succeed Justice Brandeis. He was sworn in by Chief
Justice Hughes on April 17, 1939. He was barely 40 years old.
Douglas' birthplace was the small town of Maine, Minnesota, but
his early life, through college, was spent in the State of Washington.
His family roots were in Vermont and Nova Scotia; his early life was
ruggedly Western and storybook American. His father, a Presbyterian
minister, died when Douglas was only five years old, and the young
Douglas' life was marked by the hard work necessitated by inadequate
family finances.
His college experience was at Whitman College in his home state.
Despite the lack of funds, he made his way to Columbia University in
New York City and managed to support himself by a variety of jobs.
He received his LL.B degree from Columbia in 1925, graduating sec-
ond in his class. From 1925 to 1927, he was an associate in the pres-
tigious New York law firm headed by Paul D. Cravath; and it is
typical of Douglas that at the same time he was engaged in satisfying
the relentless demands of that position, he was also teaching at Co-
lumbia Law School.
The brief period of law practice in the Cravath firm was not happy
for Douglas; but his subsequent career, including his work as a Jus-
tice of this Court, provides evidence that it honed his skills at an early
date and furnished a focus for his initial interests in the law. He soon

resigned his position at Cravath's and went back to his native Yakima,
Washington; but after a brief and unsatisfactory experiment in prac-
ticing small-town law, Douglas returned to New York City and in
1927 became an assistant professor on the Columbia Law School staff.
His field of interest was business law, reflecting the insecurities of
his precarious economic background; but even in this apparently
pedestrian area, he soon demonstrated that safe and familiar paths
were not for him. Among his fellow faculty members were some rest-
less men of remarkable intellectual power, originality and daring who
were profoundly dissatisfied with the conventional "trade-school"
character of law school research and teaching. They demanded that
research and teaching at the law school should be oriented with the
materials of life; that they be grounded in the actual problems of so-
ciety; and that the resources of other disciplines should be utilized in
the study and formulation of the law. As Douglas describes the move-
ment, the rebels were "dubbed the leaders of 'sociological juris-
prudence' ".1
Douglas quickly allied himself with this group, and when in the
spring of 1928, the President of Columbia designated a new Dean of
the Law School who was unacceptable to them, Douglas, along with
some of his colleagues, resigned from the faculty, and Douglas ac-
cepted an offer to join the faculty of the Yale Law School as Assistant
Professor. The young Robert Hutchins had become Dean of that school
and had commenced its revitalization along lines strikingly similar
to those which had been advocated by the Columbia insurgents.
Douglas' career at Yale remained solidly rooted in business law-
but with a vast difference from the conventional approach to the study
and teaching of the subject. As he did throughout his working life-at
the Securities and Exchange Commission and on this Court-he
sought, first and last, to find the realities of problems and their social,
economic and human impact. He was neither pro-business nor anti-
business; neither pro-establishment nor anti-establishment. He sought
the facts; he pursued reality; his guiding objective was to sharpen the
tools of the law and the art of the lawyer so that they would relate
to the real world, and to criticize and mold them so that they would
serve their concedéd purposes: fairness, honesty and responsiveness.
To proceed from abstract principle to practice, from doctrine to deci-
sion, was anathema to the young professor.
His output was prodigious. With collaborators, he published a series
of books completely reorganizing the teaching and study of business:
law. They included business as well as legal materials, assembled and
organized on a “functional" basis. He wrote and published scholarly
1 Go East, Young Man, p. 160.

articles and book reviews; he originated and pursued, with the col-
laboration of a sociologist, elaborate, detailed field investigations of
business failures in a number of jurisdictions; in 1929-32, he conducted
a study of bankruptcies for the Yale Institute of Human Relations
and the Department of Commerce; in his never-ending search for the
materials of real life in his chosen field, he instituted a collaborative
teaching and research program with the Harvard Business School.
It is interesting, in view of his later career, that Douglas' prodigious
output and his intense activity during these years, including years of
social and political ferment in the Nation, were substantially devoid of
of any indication of interest in professional matters or social prob-
lems outside of his chosen field of business affairs.
II.
By 1933, Douglas' reputation as an innovative and brilliant expert
in the field of business was firmly established. It was inevitable, there-
fore, that in the early days of the New Deal he would receive a call to
Washington. In 1934, at the request of SEC Chairman Joseph P.
Kennedy, Douglas became Director of the SEC's study of reorganiza-
tion and protective committees. In his hands, this study became a
thorough inquest into the aftermath of large corporate failures. It
furnished the dramatic foundation for Douglas' subsequent achieve-
ments at the SEC and established his reputation as a formidable and
effective figure in Franklin Roosevelt's government.²
In January, 1936, at age 37, he was appointed a Commissioner of
the SEC. Promptly, in a number of speeches, he began to call for re-
forms in the securities markets and the investment banking com-
munity. In September, 1937, he was appointed Chairman of the SEC,
succeeding James Landis. He served in that post for 18 months, until
his appointment as Associate Justice. Within a few weeks after assum-
ing the chairmanship of the SEC, he launched his remarkable effort to
reorganize the New York Stock Exchange, a reform which he regarded
as the core requirement of raising the standards of the financial mar-
kets. He prosecuted the program with vigor, daring and astuteness.
Aided by events, chief of which was the Richard Whitney scandal,
Douglas achieved remarkable success.
In this struggle, as throughout his career, Douglas evidenced the
profound influence of Justice Brandeis' philosophy, a philosophy
i which articulated conceptions that Douglas, as a small-town Westerner,
found to be entirely congenial. His SEC career demonstrated Douglas'
2 See Securities and Exchange Commission, "Report on the Study and Investigation of
the Work, Activities, Personnel and Functions of Protective and Reorganization Com-
mittees" (U.S. G.P.O., 1937–38).

restless refusal to confine his work within established patterns which
did not meet the rigorous standards that seemed to him to be called for;
and it evidenced his independence, relentless courage and fierce dedica-
tion to achievement of the objectives that he formulated. He was not
a follower; he regarded the existing state of affairs not as a prescrip-
tion for comfortable continuity, but as a summons for improvement.
In deciding upon objectives and plotting his course, he sought neither
collaborators nor participants; rather, after cold and surgical analysis,
he independently formulated his positions and struck out boldly to
achieve his goal. The extraordinary fact, however, is that he coupled
these highly individualistic traits with shrewd, practical sense which
enabled him to achieve, to a remarkable degree, acceptance of his ideas.
and implementation of his programs. They were frequently programs
which initially appeared impossibly visionary; but his political and
practical acumen, coupled with his burning intensity and ability to en-
list loyal support, enabled him to win a surprising degree of acceptance.
In his chosen field, Douglas was a superb technician. His practical
experience was limited; but the cutting edge of his mind, his insistence
upon the assembly of fact, fact, fact; and his extraordinary capacity
for work, enabled him to master the intricacies of corporate finance.
and securities trading and the dynamics and mechanics of business and
finance. But to him, learning was not an invitation to acceptance; it
was an avenue to questioning, to challenge, and a summons to reform
practices and institutions to meet his stern standards of upright con-
duct and efficient result.
III.
Douglas' great career as SEC Chairman ended when, in April, 1939.
he began his long career as an Associate Justice of this Court. There
was little reason in his career to that date to anticipate that he would
soon become a leader in the vindication of human rights. There was
every reason to predict that he would become the Court's expert in
cases involving business, and that, in his role, he would insist upon
strict standards of probity, fairness and responsibility. He quickly
demonstrated the latter.
During his first full term on the bench, he wrote for the Court in
Case v. Los Angeles Lumber Co., 308 U.S. 106 (1939), to hold that
reorganization plans under the Bankruptcy Act for financially dis-
tressed corporations must comply with an "absolute priority" rule.
Each successive class of creditors and stockholders, in the order and
amount of their liquidation priorities, must be fully compensated in
new securities of the reorganized corporation before anything could be
given to a junior class. This was their contract among themselves and

215
with the corporation; and fair-dealing demanded that the contract
be honored.³
In succeeding terms of the Court, Douglas wrote many opinions for
the Court and a number of dissents in cases involving business affairs.
In all of them, his technical proficiency is evident; but successively,
his opinions in business cases demonstrated the widening of his hori-
zons. More and more, his opinions for the Court and in dissent referred
to the writings and philosophy of Justice Brandeis, and included not
only an insistence upon fair dealing, strict performance of contract
obligations, and a concern for the interests of investors, but also an
evolving tendency to take into account more general public interests.
For example, his landmark opinion for the Court in Federal Power
Commission v. Hope Natural Gas Co., 320 U.S. 591 (1944), substan-
tially adopted the Brandeis-Holmes view of ratemaking, and he in-
sisted that "the fixing of 'just and reasonable' rates, involves a bal-
ancing of the investor and the consumer interests".
His memorable dissent in United States v. Columbia Steel Co., 334
U.S. 495, 535–36 (1948), is a Brandeisian essay on the subject of big-
ness. His early opinion in United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co.,
310 U.S. 150, 221 (1940), holding that a combination to fix prices was
illegal per se under the Sherman Act, similarly exhibited his aversion
to the use of aggregated power and his commitment to the Brandeisian
ideal of independent, competitive business entities.
Again, in majority and dissenting opinions, announcing a theme
which he had advocated in his days as a law school professor, he dem-
onstrated that he would strictly apply statutory principles to inhibit or
discourage the extension of the control of the "money trust” over
American business-a theme for which he acknowledged indebtedness
to Justice Brandeis.*
IV.
The emergence of Justice Douglas as the great civil libertarian is
a fascinating story. When he first became a member of the Court, his
colleagues were Chief Justice Hughes and Justices McReynolds, But-
ler, Stone, Roberts, Black, Reed and Frankfurter. In 1940, Butler was
succeeded by Frank Murphy; in 1941, McReynolds and Chief Justice
Hughes were succeeded by Roosevelt's nominees, Byrnes and Jackson;
3 In two cases in subsequent terms, Douglas characteristically buttressed the "absolute
priority" rule by insisting upon standards for valuation which provided some assurance
that the new distribution of shares and interests to stockholders and creditors would
be realistic—that is, based upon prospective earnings. Consolidated Rock Products Co. v.
DuBois, 312 U.S. 510, 525-526 (1941); Group of Institutional Investors v. Chicago,
Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific R. Co., 318 U.S. 523, 540 (1943).
* See Directors Who Do Not Direct, 47 Harv.L.Rev. 1305 (1934); United States v.
W.T. Grant Co., 346 U.S. 629, 636 (1953) (dissent); Blau v. Lehman, 368 U.S. 403,
419–20 (1962) (dissent).

and in 1943, Rutledge was appointed to succeed Justice Byrnes who
had resigned after a short tenure. Douglas' longest association had
been with Justice Frankfurter, dating to the days when they were law
teachers; but their friendly personal relationship had been colored by
the strong differences between the Young Turks of the Yale Law
School and the less ebullient law faculty at Harvard, led by Frank-
furter. For this reason, and perhaps more importantly, by reason of
temperament and background, it quickly occurred that Douglas' closest
association among his colleagues was not with Justice Frankfurter,
but with Hugo Black. Douglas and Black early found common ground
which they generally occupied until the 1960's when their positions on
significant civil rights issues diverged.
Douglas has been quoted as saying that it takes a dozen years on
the Court for a Justice's judicial philosophy to mature. There is no
evidence that his period of maturation was so long, but in his early
years on the Court, his votes in several civil rights cases were later to
be regretted and repudiated by him. An early test came in the Gobitis
case in 1940,5 a case challenging the expulsion from public school of
two children of the Jehovah's Witnesses sect for refusal to comply with
a flag-salute ordinance. The Court rejected the challenge and sustained
the ordinance. Only Justice Harlan F. Stone dissented. Frankfurter
wrote the Court's opinion and Douglas, as well as Justices Black,
Murphy and Reed-the other Roosevelt appointees-joined. Two years
later, in Jones v. City of Opelika, in which the Court held that the
imposition upon Jehovah's Witnesses of a licensing fee for solicitation
sales of their literature was constitutional, Black, Douglas and
Murphy, dissenting, confessed that Gobitis was wrongly decided. Both
Gobitis and Opelika, in their view, wrongly approved a "device" which
"tends to suppress the free exercise of a religion practiced by a minority
group".
Similarly, in 1942, Justice Douglas joined in a decision which, in
effect, reaffirmed the ruling in Olmstead v. United States, 227 U.S. 438
(1928) that warrantless wiretapping did not violate the Fourth
Amendment. Douglas agreed with the majority, which included Jus-
tice Black, despite the fact that Chief Justice Stone and Justices
Frankfurter and Murphy dissented and indicated their readiness to
overrule Olmstead.⁹

These early votes, which are anomalous in view of Justice Douglas'
later positions, may be explained on a variety of possible grounds:
New Justices often are inclined to accept the views of the majority
in areas in which they do not consider themselves expert; Douglas'
views in the area had not fully developed; and he was following the
lead of Justice Black and other Justices whom he respected.
Douglas' votes in the Japanese internment cases, which also appear
somewhat anomalous in view of his subsequent history, may have a
different or additional basis. In 1943, he voted with the majority in
condoning the indiscriminate internment of Japanese; a year later
he joined Justice Black's majority opinion sanctioning exclusion of
a Japanese from his home-town in California. In his separate opinion
in the 1943 case, he explained his vote: It was wartime; Pearl Harbor
had been bombed; and Douglas was "unwilling to sit in judgment on
the military requirements of that hour".10
Soon, however, Justice Douglas found his stride and began the
establishment of his position as an undeviating champion of indi-
vidual rights. His conception of individual rights was comprehen-
sive. As he ultimately formulated it, the "Blessings of Liberty" in-
cluded not only physical security, but "autonomous control over the
development and expression of one's intellect, interests, tastes and per-
sonality" and "freedom of choice in the basic decisions of one's life
respecting marriage, divorce, procreation, contraception, and the edu-
cation and upbringing of children"." He maintained that all of these
were sternly and broadly guaranteed by our Constitution and that the
Court was their ultimate guardian; and he rejected what he regarded
as the artificial and labored distinctions which could be drawn by nice
analysis of the words of the Constitution or differentiations between
the Constitution's mandates and prohibitions directed to the federal
and state governments, respectively.
His insistence upon judicial action to vindicate this sweeping con-
ception of constitutional guarantees met bitter opposition from mem-
bers of the public who were opposed to the social, economic and politi-
cal implications of Douglas' insistence upon pervasive individual
rights, and from those who feared or challenged the unconventionality
of his jurisprudence. But the time was appropriate for newly revealed
constitutional values. Douglas' bold ideas were launched during the
1940's, 50's and 60's, at a time of ferment and revolutionary change
10 Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U.S. 81, 106 (1943); Korematsu v. United States,
323 U.S. 214 (1944). He later characterized the decisions in the two cases as "extreme";
and in 1944, in the Endo case, he wrote for the Court that the Government could not con-
tinue to detain a Japanese-American after her loyalty had been established. Ex parte

in societal mores. A wave of suppression, typified by Senator Joseph
McCarthy, was eventually met and overwhelmed by a tide of insistence
upon individual rights and individual permissiveness; the pressures
of egalitarianism with its accompanying insistence upon the divine
right of each individual, were enormous; and Douglas' exalted con-
ception found a ready and receptive constituency. It is perhaps this
phenomenon of history-the fact that Douglas' positions coincided
with vast social changes-rather than successive changes in the mem-
bership of the Court, that accounts for the remarkable degree to which
his innovative views became accepted constitutional doctrine and na-
tional principle. It may be that Douglas' views would not have met
with comprehensive acceptance by the Court if it had not been for
changes in its membership; but it is equally likely that the succeeding
Court would not have embraced the full measure of libertarian prin-
ciples if it had not been for the pioneering of Justice Douglas.
Douglas was largely responsible for the establishment of the right
of privacy as a distinct value protected by the Bill of Rights. Liter-
alists may complain that the Constitution does not refer to a “right
of privacy"; but to Douglas, principle and essence are controlling,
and the "right of privacy" is a statement of the essence of the specific
constitutional guarantees. Certainly, its recognition as a distinct right
is useful and seminal. It is a dramatic embodiment of Douglas' in- |
sistence that our Constitution's protection of individual rights is com-
prehensive and is not to be confined to a narrow literal parsing of its
words.
In 1952, the Court held that a municipal transit company could
broadcast radio programs, including commercial announcements, on
its buses and streetcars. In his dissenting opinion, Douglas asserted
that the right to "liberty" as used in the Fifth Amendment, "means
more than freedom from governmental restraint; it must include
privacy as well. . . . The right to be let alone is indeed the beginning
of all freedom".12 This is obviously a doctrine of vast implications,
incorporating, by a stroke of creative conceptualism, the comprehen-
sive view of constitutionally-guaranteed liberties which Douglas was
later to formulate.13
Douglas was later to invoke the principle of privacy in a variety
of circumstances dealing with governmental actions affecting in-
dividuals. The boldest use of the "right" appeared in 1965, when
Douglas wrote the opinion of the Court in Griswold v. Connecticut,
12 Public Utilities Commission v. Pollak, 343 U.S. 451, 467 (1952).
13 Concurring opinion in Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton, supra, note 11.
14 See e.g., Wyman v. James, 400 U.S. 309, 329 (1971), in which Douglas, in dissent,
invokes the privacy of the home as demonstrating the unconstitutionality under the
Fourth Amendment of inspection of a welfare recipient's house.

381 U.S. 479 (1965), which invalidated a Connecticut law forbidding
the use of contraceptives. Douglas' opinion “for the Court" based the
decision squarely upon the right of privacy. He argued that the right
of privacy exists by necessary implication from specific provisions of
the Constitution; that "its existence is necessary in making the express
guarantees fully meaningful" (at 483). 15 As concurring opinions in
Griswold contended, the grounds for the Court's decision could have
been formulated on a less enterprising basis; but the support which
the Court's opinion provides for a distinct, constitutional right of
privacy, is significant. Using that newly-articulated right as a specific
instrument or as an aid to broaden the literal words of the Bill of
Rights, the application of the Constitution's specific guarantees of in-
dividual liberties could be substantially expanded.
A kindred doctrinal innovation which Douglas propounded is the
right to travel, a “right” which unlike the "right to privacy” had
little or no antecedents in the Court's opinions. In 1941, the Court held
that California's "Okie" law was an unconstitutional burden on com-
merce. Douglas concurred, but on the grounds that the right to travel
was a guarantee of citizenship under the Fourteenth Amendment's
privilege and immunities clause. 16 Twenty-seven years later, in Shapiro
v. Thompson,17 a majority of the Court recognized the right to travel
as "fundamental" under the Fourteenth Amendment.
In a number of other instances, Justice Douglas had the satisfaction
of participating in Court decisions adopting principles which he had
first articulated in dissent. Conspicuous among these are decisions
dealing with the scope of the right to counsel, as to which Douglas
shared Justice Black's views. In Crooker v. California, 357 U.S. 433,
441 (1958), Douglas had dissented from a decision of the Court sustain-
ing the conviction of a defendant on the basis of a confession made
without counsel, after five or six hours of interrogation. In a concurring
opinion in 1961, Culombe v. Connecticut, 367 U.S. 568, 637 (1961), he
urged that the Court should accept the principle "that any accused―
whether rich or poor-has the right to consult a lawyer before talking
with the police”.
Gradually, beginning with Massiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201
(1964), and Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U.S. 478 (1964), and culminating
in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), the Court adopted Justice
Douglas' views on the matter as it did in many other areas: Once an in-
dividual is "taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom.
15 He elaborated this proposition by a picturesque literary flight: that "specific guar-
antees in the Bill of Rights . . . have penumbras, formed by emanations from those guar-
antees that help give them life and substance" (at 484).

in any significant way", he must be advised of his Fifth Amendment
right to be silent and of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, by
appointment of a lawyer by the state, if necessary; and if the person
apprehended indicates that he wants an attorney, all interrogation
"must cease until an attorney is present.'
" 18
Similarly, Douglas, in 1942, joined Justice Black in dissent from
the Court's decision upholding a state conviction despite the denial
of counsel at trial, Betts v. Brady, 316 U.S. 445, 474 (1942). More
than 20 years later, they had the satisfaction of participating in the
overruling of this decision in Gideon v. Wainright, 372 U.S. 335
(1963).19
In 1951, Douglas alone noted his dissent from the Court's order
affirming a decision upholding the Virginia poll tax, Butler v. Thomp-
son, 341 U.S. 937 (1951). In 1966, he wrote the Court's opinion hold-
ing, under the equal protection clause, that a state could not impose a
poll tax as a condition of voting. Harper v. Virginia State Board of
Elections, 383 U.S. 663 (1966).
Justice Douglas' opinions in the right to counsel cases, as in other
cases where he alone or in conjunction with others expanded judicial
enforcement of procedural rights in criminal cases, illuminate his
characteristic approach. Typically, the cases involved indigents and
the underprivileged; and to Douglas, their predicaments were a sum-
mons to close scrutiny of the process by which government imposed
penalties upon them. It was the meaning, the essence of the situa-
tion presented, that to him was the essential premise from which con-
clusions followed.20 By contrast, the approach of Justice Black, his
colleague and collaborator for many years, was more conventional;
Black was a strict constructionist of the words of the Constitution,
who proceeded to conclusions drawn, by his lights, from carefully
considered analysis of the meaning of the words of the Constitution.
Students of the Constitution and the judicial process will find this
difference in approach, coupled with a long-term-but not complete-
coincidence of conclusions, a fruitful source of analysis and specula-
tion.
This is not to say, however, that Douglas' pioneering represented
departures from the precepts of the Constitution. The remarkable

bama, 368 U.S. 52, 54–55 (1961) (right to counsel at arraignment), and the Court's decl-
sion, in which Douglas joined, in White v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 59 (1963) (preliminary hear-
ing in advance of arraignment is a "critical step in a criminal proceeding" at which de-
fendant must have counsel).
19 Cf. Douglas' opinion for the Court in Haley v. Ohio, 332 U.S. 596 (1948) (confession of
15-year old after ordeal of questioning without counsel).
20 See his opinion for the Court in Skinner v. State of Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535 (1942),
holding unconstitutional, as a violation of equal protection, the Oklahoma statute provid-
ing for compulsory sterilization of criminals after a third felony conviction.

degree to which his conclusions were eventually adopted by the Court,
and the fact that they have largely withstood the test of time, provide
evidence of their harmony with our basic law. Indeed, it may be said
that his preconceptions were those which animated our Constitution,
and that his conclusions were imminent in that document. Nor can it
be said that he was heedless of the need, commanded by the rule of
law, to justify conclusions by doctrine. The point is that he did not
hesitate to articulate, and proceed on the basis of, doctrines which he
formulated, sometimes with piercing originality. The process, to him,
was consistent with and mandated by the magnificent generality of the
basic provisions of our Constitution and their essential purpose.
His intense insistence that the individual confrontation with the
power of the state must be accorded the fullest protection of the Con-
stitution, is manifest in the votes that he cast as a member of this
Court. He believed that the guarantees to the accused in criminal
prosecutions were "not only a protection against conviction and prose-
cution but a safeguard of conscience and human dignity and free-
dom of expression as well".21 And so, he strongly objected to the
dilution of the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimina-
tion by requiring testimony where "transactional" or "use" immunity
was granted.22 The privilege is a fundamental barrier to state oppres-
sion, and a symbol and a manifestation of the ultimate sovereignty
of the individual, and Douglas fiercely opposed its diminution. Sim-
ilarly, aware of Justice Brandeis' admonition that "in the develop-
ment of our liberty insistence upon procedural regularity has been a
large factor", 23 he opposed the narrow application of the Fourth
Amendment's prohibitions of the invasion of the individual's domain
by unreasonable searches and seizures.24
In the controversies involving the First Amendment, Justice Doug-
las established his position as an uncompromising advocate of the
broadest interpretation of the freedoms of speech, the press and reli-
gion. Building on a view expressed by Justice Stone, 25 Douglas, along
with Black, asserted that the First Amendment's freedoms were in
a "preferred position" in our constitutional scheme; and they insisted
that state as well as federal action infringing upon the basic rights
must be subjected to strict scrutiny. 26 Street orators denouncing the
President; 27 racists uttering libelous abuse of blacks and abusively

criticizing the Court itself; 28 Communists circulating radical propa-
ganda 29 all were entitled to the shield of the First Amendment. If
their utterances provoked listeners to throw stones and bottles, it was
the duty of the police to protect the speaker from the crowd and not
vice versa.30
Douglas was troubled by the question whether this right to speak
freely should be limited by the "clear and present" danger test. As
early as 1949, he made clear his view that the danger must rise "far
above public inconvenience, annoyance or unrest", Terminiello, at 4.
In 1957, he stated his own version of the test: that the First Amend-
ment guaranty of freedom of expression is absolute and can be quali-
fied only when the expression "is so closely brigaded with illegal action
as to be an inseparable part of it". Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476,
508, 514 (1957). Eventually, in 1969, he announced that, at least in
time of peace, he had "great misgivings" about the "clear and present
danger” test because he believed that it had been wrongly applied “by
judges so wedded to the status quo that critical analysis made them
nervous". Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 44, 454 (1969) (concurring).
Where the conflict between freedom and the societal interest in the
avoidance of physical disorder is not presented, Douglas' view was
absolute: "the First Amendment is couched in absolute terms—freedom
of speech shall not be abridged", Beauharnais, supra, note 28 at 285;
"The matter is beyond the power of the legislature to regulate, control
or condition", Poulos, supra, note 26 at 423. Censorship of movies or
written material, in his judgment, is absolutely prohibited by the First
Amendment.31 Teachers may not be subjected to loyalty tests or dis-
missed for membership in alleged subversive organizations.32 His belief
in open advocacy and debate also induced in him an unwillingness to
tolerate governmental actions which, in his view, shielded govern-
mental action even Presidential acts-from public scrutiny.³
33
In the 1960's, Douglas' broad view of the scope of First Amendment
protection for the expression of views resulted in significant differences
with Justice Black. Black refused to vote to invalidate a conviction
under state trespass laws of students who demonstrated in front of a
county jail where some of their fellow protestors against segregation
were incarcerated. Douglas dissented. Adderly v. Florida, 385 U.S.
39 (1966). Douglas' insistence that symbolic expresson was equally

32 Adler v. Board of Education, 342 U.S. 485, 508 (1952) (dissent).
33 E.g., he joined the Court's decision in the Pentagon papers case, New York Times v.
United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971), and he regarded the Court's action, which he joined,
approving a lower court order compelling President Nixon to surrender tape-records of
conversations, United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 (1974), as of great importance.

entitled to protection with verbal expression was unacceptable to Jus-
tice Black in the 1960's. This was evident in Black's dissent from the
Court's opinion, in which Douglas joined, holding that students could
not be dismissed from a public school for wearing black armbands in
class to protest the Vietnam war. Tinker v. Des Moines Community
School District, 393 U.S. 503 (1969). And in United States v. O'Brien,
391 U.S. 367, 389 (1969), Douglas dissented from a Court decision in
which Justice Black joined, sustaining a conviction for the burning
of a draft card. Later, in Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, 450
(1969), Douglas, concurring, stated that the Court's decision in
O'Brien "was not, with all respect, consistent with the First Amend-
ment" (at 455); O'Brien's act, he said, was protected by the First
Amendment as a "symbolic protest" (at 456).
Black and Douglas, however, had never waivered in their solid
resistance to the pressures of McCarthyism which were formidable
in the loyalty cases. In 1951, the Court had held invalid the Attorney
General's compilation, without notice or opportunity for rebuttal,
of a list of subversive organizations, affiliation with which was grounds
for dismissal from federal employment under President Truman's
executive order. Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath,
341 U.S. 123 (1923). On the same day, by a four to four decision, the
Court left standing the dismissal from government service of Dorothy
Bailey on the basis of membership in organizations on the Attorney
General's list and the undisclosed statement of anonymous informers.34
Both Black and Douglas wrote separate, concurring opinions in the
Joint Anti-Fascist case; Douglas' opinion is especially significant be-
cause he expressly criticized the result in the Bailey case which, he
said, presents "an excellent illustration of how dangerous a departure
from our constitutional standards can be”. 341 U.S. at 179–80.
Justice Douglas believed that the First Amendment established.
an impenetrable barrier between the government and religious estab-
lishments and beliefs. From the early years of his tenure as a Justice
of this Court, he voted no as to religious instruction or prayer in
public schools; 35 he voted no to government loan of textbooks to
parochial schools; 36 and in 1970, he alone voted to strike down the
tax exemption for property used solely for religious purposes.37
He believed that racial segregation was an evil and that the court
should be vigilant and resourceful in finding that segregation, by
whatever means and wherever it occurred, in public or private place,

violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; 38
and he early and steadfastly insisted that laws burdening the right of
sufferage to the prejudice of the underprivileged were constitution-
ally intolerable. See, e.g., Day Brite Lighting, Inc. v. Missouri, 342
U.S. 421 (1952).
In this area, as in all other matters affecting the liberty and dignity
of the individual, history may well agree that Chief Justice Marshall's
tribute to the Court over which he presided is applicable to Justice
Douglas: that he "never thought to enlarge the judicial power beyond
its proper bounds, nor feared to carry it to the fullest extent that duty
required." 39
Finally, as we survey the remarkable career of Justice Douglas, we
acknowledge with gratitude and reverence his extraordinary contri-
butions in other fields-in addition to the law-to the preservation and
development of freedom in our Nation and to the evolution of consti-
tutional principle. Our survey has been confined to Justice Douglas'
career in the law. The sheer volume of his output during his 36 years
on the Court is overwhelming; but it does not measure his activities
during that time. It is an extraordinary fact that, simultaneously, he
was in the vanguard of other great causes. He was a world traveler
who, in a number of impressive publications, alerted the Nation to
the problems and aspirations of the people of the less developed parts
of our planet, which have become a central fact in the life of our Nation
and the world. He was a prophet and pioneer with respect to environ-
mental concerns; his activities and writings were of early and signal
importance in developing programs for the protection of our forests,
rivers, streams and mountains.
In a real sense, his myriad activities were intertwined. He was deep-
ly aware that our freedoms are dependent not only upon the quality
of our understanding of constitutional principles and their faithful
and relentless application, but also upon our interrelationship with
the other peoples of the world, and upon the quality of the land in
which we live. All of these concerns he accepted as personal chal-
lenges to himself, to his understanding, his energy, and his ability and
willingness to risk the consequences of unconventionality. To him,
the existence of a problem was a challenge to probe its depth and com-
position, and a summons to devise and advocate a solution.
As a Justice, he did not hesitate to stand alone; 40 he was not intimi-
dated by harsh criticism or the stridency of the McCarthyites; as an
38 E.g., Palmer v. Thompson, 403 U.S. 217, 231 (1971) (dissent); Moose Lodge No. 107 v.
Irvis, 407 U.S. 163, 179 (1972) (dissent).

Barnette, 319 U.S. 624 at 668 (1943).

environmentalist, in eloquent language, he insisted that not only na-
tional policy, but the courts should respond to the call to preserve our
natural heritage." As a world citizen, passionately devoted to peace,
he was ready to test the limits of Presidential power to engage in mili-
tary operations.

WHEREFORE, it is RESOLVED that we, the Bar of the Supreme
Court of the United States, express our profound sorrow that Asso-
ciate Justice William Orville Douglas is no longer with us; we express
our deep gratitude for his outstanding and original contributions to
the evolution of constitutional doctrine; and our admiration and ap-
preciation of his unfailing courage and his insistence upon the prin-
ciples that he considered to reflect the genius of our Constitution and
the highest aspirations of our people. We record our acknowledgement
of his participation as a constructive leader in three of the great issues
of our time: The expansion of human rights and liberty, the protec-
tion of the environment, and the recognition of the rightful demands
of the less privileged people of the world. We are grateful to him for
providing his example of fearless dedication which has inspired us
and will inspire future generations of lawyers and judges; and it is
further
RESOLVED, That the Solicitor General be asked to present these
Resolutions to the Court and that the Attorney General be asked to
move that they be inscribed upon the Court's permanent records."
The Chief Justice said:
"Thank you, Mr. Solicitor General, and I recognize the Attorney
General of the United States."
Mr. Attorney General Civiletti addressed the Court as follows:
"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
The Bar of the Court met today to honor the memory of William
O. Douglas, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court from 1939 to
1975.
In the 36 years during which Mr. Justice Douglas served on the
Court, this Nation emerged from an economic depression, fought a
world war and two other serious armed conflicts, struggled to elimi-
nate race prejudice and its pervasive effects, came to recognize the
threat that unthinking and ravaging industrial production posed to
its ecological systems, and faced increasing complexities in its social
life that tested its political and economic institutions. All of these
41 See United States v. Reserve Mining Co., 419 U.S. 802 (1974) (dissent from denial
of application to vacate stay); and Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 741 (1972)
(dissent).

TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 1980
problems came before this Court in one form or another, and Mr.
Justice Douglas was always ready to confront them. He brought to
them a brilliant mind, open to ideas and creative solutions; but he
rejected any approach that appeared to be out of harmony with the
liberties rooted in the Bill of Rights. He brought to these contests a
prodigious energy: he was not only the most prolific author of opinions
ever to sit on the Court, but also the author of over thirty books on a
wide variety of subjects. But most of all he brought to this work a
great passion and the courage and ability to express it for us and for
those to come after us.
Early in his tenure on the Court he made important contributions
in the area of economic regulation—as might have been expected in
light of his experience as an attorney with a Wall Street firm, as a
director of bankruptcy studies at Yale Law School, and as a member,
and then Chairman, of the Securities and Exchange Commission. His
opinion for the Court in Pepper v. Litton, 308 U.S. 295 (1939), most
clearly displays the strength of his views concerning the obligations
of corporate fiduciaries. In that opinion, which upheld the challenge of
an independent trustee in bankruptcy to a claim based on a judgment
against the bankrupt corporation collusively procured by the
dominant stockholder, he emphasized the breadth of the fiduciary
obligation owed by a corporate officer. That standard of conduct, he
wrote, "is designed for the protection of the entire community of
interests in a corporation-creditors as well as stockholders." 308 U.S.
at 307. Mr. Justice Douglas was the author of numerous other opinions
construing the federal Bankruptcy Act, including careful and detailed
treatments of complicated problems involving railroad reorganizations
in Meyer v. Fleming, 327 U.S. 161 (1946), and Gardner v. New Jersey,
329 U.S. 565 (1947).
He also made a significant impact on the field of antitrust law. His
opinions include California Motor Transport Co. v. Trucking Unlim-
ited, 404 U.S. 508 (1972), and Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States,
410 U.S. 366 (1973), and an early opinion, sure to remain bedrock for |
generations to come-his masterful treatment of price-manipulation
in United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150 (1940). Until
that opinion was handed down, it was supposed by many lawyers and
businessmen that agreements that affected price levels but did not
literally fix prices were not per se unlawful and thus could be defended
against Sherman Act charges by proof that the agreement had a
benign purpose, such as the elimination of competitive evils. Mr. Jus-
tice Douglas scotched that defense in the much-quoted holding that
"Under the Sherman Act a combination formed for the purpose and
with the effect of raising, depressing, fixing, pegging, or stabilizing

TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 1980
227
the prices of a commodity in interstate or foreign commerce is illegal
per se." 310 U.S. at 223. Nearly thirty years later, in United States v.
Container Corporation of America, 393 U.S. 333 (1969), he returned
to his subject, writing an opinion for the Court holding that the recip-
rocal exchange of price information by the corporate defendants in
that case violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act.
In his Socony opinion, Mr. Justice Douglas spoke of the Sherman
Act as a "charter of freedom" (310 U.S. at 221), a view that followed
from his deep distrust of large concentrations of power having no
effective social accountability. In one of the addresses collected in his
book titled Democracy and Finance, published in 1940, he expressed
the view that the trend toward large corporate combinations threat-
ened not only our competitive system, individual initiative and free-
dom of opportunity which was the essence of capitalism, but also other
important democratic values. He looked to government as an impor-
tant source of countervailing power and thus, in decisions such as his
opinions for the Court in Federal Power Commission v. Hope Natural
Gas Company, 320 U.S. 591 (1944), National Labor Relations Board
v. Link-Belt Co., 311 U.S. 584 (1941), and United States v. Detroit &
Cleveland Navigation Co., 326 U.S. 236 (1945) (the latter an Interstate
Commerce Commission case), he expressed a willingness to accord
broad powers and discretion to the independent administrative agen-
cies as they sought to carry out congressional mandates to protect the
public interest in the matters regulated by those agencies.
But Mr. Justice Douglas was by no means an uncritical advocate
of government regulation of American life. He was, above all, the
champion of the individual, and in many of his most memorable
opinions notably those grounded on the First Amendment—he em-
phasized the importance of maintaining space, free from government
interference, in which each individual can express his views, enjoy his
privacy, and live his life according to his own lights. Maintaining this
freedom was essential, he believed, not only for the benefit of each in-
dividual, but also for the health of society as a whole. Thus in Ter-
miniello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 4 (1949), upholding the right of a
speaker to express views that angered a crowd gathered outside the
auditorium in which he spoke, Mr. Justice Douglas observed that "The
vitality of civil and political institutions in our society depends on
free discussion [; and the] right to speak freely and to promote diver-
sity of ideas and programs is . . . one of the chief distinctions that
sets us apart from totalitarian regimes." And he added provocatively:
"[A] function of free speech under our system of government is to
invite dispute. It may indeed best serve its high purpose when it in-
duces a condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions as

228
TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 1980
they are, or even stirs people to anger." In his dissent in Dennis v.
United States, 341 U.S. 494 (1951), speaking out against convictions
under the Smith Act for what he regarded as the mere act of teaching
Marxist-Leninist doctrine and organizing others to do the same, he
expressed the belief that the "airing of ideas releases pressures which
otherwise might become destructive," and that in an atmosphere of
free and full discussion, false ideas will be exposed and will "gain
few adherents" (341 U.S. at 584).
Mr. Justice Douglas' belief that the First Amendment also guaran-
teed a right of individual privacy and that this too was essential to
a healthy society was in no way inconsistent with his vision of a robust,
lively, and diverse America, for it was the heavy hand of government
meddling in areas protected under the First Amendment that he op-
posed, not the babble and jostle of crowds in public spaces. Perhaps his
best known opinion concerned with this right is Griswold v. Connecti-
cut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), recognizing a "zone of privacy created by
several fundamental constitutional guarantees" (381 U.S. at 485), and
prohibiting government intervention in the sensitive and personal deci-
sions of married couples concerning procreation. But the note was
struck earlier in his dissent in Public Utilities Commission v. Pollak,
343 U.S. 451 (1952), a case concerned with the Commission's approval
of a public transit system's practice of broadcasting radio programs
consisting of musical selections and commercials in streetcars and
buses. To Mr. Justice Douglas, this was government-approved coer-
cion of a "captive audience" (343 U.S. at 468), not only an intrusion
on the transit-riders' private ruminations but a form of regimentation;
for some centralized official body was choosing the programs rather
than leaving it to the people to make their own choices between "com-
peting entertainments" (343 U.S. at 469).
If Mr. Justice Douglas spoke frequently in dissenting opinions and
in concurrences that bore his unique, unmistakable imprint, he some-
times spoke prophetically, setting forth a view that would eventually
command a majority of the Court. Thus his dissent on the Fourth
Amendment warrant issue in Frank v. Maryland, 359 U.S. 360 (1959),
bore fruit in the Court's opinions in Camara v. Municipal Court, 387
U.S. 523 (1967), and See v. Seattle, 387 U.S. 541 (1967); and he dis-
sented on the Fifth Amendment self-incrimination issue in Cohen v.
Hurley, 366 U.S. 117 (1961), subsequently overruled in Spevack v.
Klein, 385 U.S. 511 (1967), in which he wrote the plurality opinion.
His dissent in South v. Peters, 339 U.S. 276, 277 (1950), from the
Court's per curiam opinion, which held that a constitutional challenge
to Georgia's county unit system presented a political issue as to which
the district court properly withheld relief, was later vindicated in this
Court's reapportionment decisions.

TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 1980
229
In the brief time we have here, it is not possible to discuss all of the
areas in which Mr. Justice Douglas has made contributions. In his long
tenure on the Court he dealt with the full range of issues that came
before it, making significant contributions in cases concerning civil
rights, securities regulation, the military and the selective service sys-
tem, and in cases coming within the Court's original jurisdiction. But
no discussion of Mr. Justice Douglas' career would be complete with-
☐ out reference to his concern for the environment. In his dissenting
opinion in Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727 (1972), a case concerned
with the highly technical doctrine of standing, he explained why, in
cases involving environmental issues, he would accord standing to
anyone representing "the inanimate object about to be despoiled, de-
faced, or invaded by roads and bulldozers" (405 U.S. at 741)-valleys,
alpine meadows, groves of trees, and rivers, all of them essential to
the survival of fish, birds, and wildlife (id. at 743). In this opinion,
Mr. Justice Douglas spoke out again in favor of nurturing a diverse
community, but here he extended the community to include all forms
of life "the pileated woodpecker as well as the coyote and the bear,
the lemmings as well as the trout in the streams" (id. at 752). This dis-
sent lacks the significance in the development of the doctrine of stand-
ing that his opinion for the Court in a case such as Barlow v. Collins,
397 U.S. 159 (1970), enjoys; but it stands as a reminder both of the
source from which he drew much of his strength and inspiration and
of the distinctive voice of a man unafraid to step to the music of a
different drummer.
Mr. Chief Justice, in the name of the lawyers of this Nation and, in
particular, of the bar of this Court, I respectfully request that the
resolutions presented to you in honor and celebration of the memory of
the late Mr. Justice Douglas be accepted by this Court."
The Chief Justice said:
"Thank you, Mr. Attorney General and Mr. Solicitor General, and
on behalf of the Court I particularly thank you for these splendid
resolutions summarizing the career and in memory of our late colleague
and friend, Justice Douglas.
We ask that you convey to the members of the Committee on Resolu-
tions our deep appreciation for their very appropriate presentation
here today.
Your motion, Mr. Attorney General, that these resolutions be made
part of the permanent record of this Court is granted.
Justice Douglas' long tenure on this Court, without more, sufficed to
make him a unique figure in the Court's annals. In his 36 years on the
Court our country experienced massive and pervasive changes in its
social, political, and economic structure. Worldwide conflicts disturbed

230
TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 1980
and altered American life, leaving in their wake mountains of in-
tractable problems.
During this long tenure on the Court Justice Douglas participated
in more than one-fourth of all the reported cases in this Court since.
1790, a record, as you have pointed out in your resolutions, unparal-
leled. But more important even than the volume is the nature of the
issues the Court was called upon to deal with during this period. You
have mentioned some of the specific cases and specific issues.
Bill Douglas and I were colleagues on the Court for six years, and
even during that short span the Court was confronted with some of
the most vexing and sensitive and complex issues in the history of the
Court. Disagreement on such issues is of course the norm. It has always
been so, and always will be under our system. Indeed, it is imperative
that this be the case, for a pattern of unanimity is alien to democratic
institutions.
I share with others great respect for his keen mind, his unwavering
commitment to his own beliefs, and his zest for grappling with new
problems. All of us were the beneficiaries of his unparalleled first-hand.
knowledge of a multitude of past decisions of the Court, and in con-
ferences now we miss his verbal footnotes describing the details of the
evolution of many of those decisions.
Bill Douglas lived life to the fullest in the manner of the rugged indi-
vidualists who opened this continent, people he admired so much. The
opening of this continent was a task for strong, independent, assertive,
vigorous, creative, and imaginative people. The words I have just used
really describe Bill Douglas. He exemplified them. He exemplified all
these qualities.
As we know, his adventurous, questing spirit led him all over the
world. He traveled in order to experience the beauty of the natural
environment, and to understand other people, to probe into their ways
of life, to learn of their suffering and of their aspirations. In one of
our many visits in my chambers over a cup of tea he said once that his
travels throughout the world had given him a better understanding
of the grandeur and majesty of the American democratic idea and
ideal, of our commitment to freedom, and the success of our Constitu-
tion. He shared the conviction of his friend, Henry Steele Commager,
that nothing in all history succeeded like America.
Few Justices of this Court in our history sought more, I think, to
press for reexamination of established patterns and accepted percep-
tions of our social and economic and political structure. His lifelong
pursuit of his own ideals demonstrates that people of imagination
and courage who feel deeply, as he did, and who act on their beliefs, as
he did, are those who make others think and rethink conventional

TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 1980
231
beliefs. With Justice Holmes he believed that to live life fully one
must share in the passions and actions of his time. And long before
the word "ecology" had found its way into the popular vocabulary
he was, as both the Attorney General and the Solicitor General have
told us, an ardent student of conservation, and an advocate of the
preservation of the gifts of nature.
Those of us who live by the Potomac, indeed, all of the people of
this country, owe a debt to Bill Douglas for his protests and his
efforts which saved the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal from what he
called "the roar of the wheels and the sound of the horns." Due largely
to him the Canal was preserved and declared a National Historic
Park. And many of us here today were present when the Canal was
dedicated in his name, pursuant to an Act of the Congress.
In his fourscore years, Bill Douglas climbed many mountains; not
just the visible mountains on our continent and other continents, but
mountains of the law and mountains of ideas, economic, social, and
political. Like so many restless, dynamic, inquisitive human beings,
he left trails of his philosophical and his physical explorations so
that others may share them and, if they wish, follow his trail.
Some aspects of Bill Douglas' image, his public image-in part, at
least reflect the distortions inherent in modern life, and the penchant
to put public figures into immutable slots. He was called a godless
atheist and a leftist activist. But of course, as we well know, he was
neither. He had strong views as to how to preserve the freedom of
the private enterprise system from even some of its own flaws.
He was a deeply religious man, but religious in his own way, and
not in any orthodox pattern. His range of moods reflected the range
of his interests in life, and that covered virtually all of the human
condition. Sometimes like a comet, as we know, he would flare and
as quickly subside. But his intimates who understood him relished
the light and ignored the heat.
He was unconcerned about his public image. In fact, I think, he
took no little delight in confounding his critics. The ill-advised and,
happily, short-lived thrust at an impeachment naturally disturbed
him as it would disturb any man, and he properly resented it. But
even on that his concern was not for long. At times he could have
explained himself and warded off some of the hostility that was aimed
at him from time to time, but for various reasons, he declined to do so.
I sometimes wondered whether or not he chafed in the inescapably
monastic life on this Court, and longed really to be in the rough and
tumble of the political arena or the business world, where he could
let himself go giving blows and warding them off. He took a pixie

232
TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 1980
delight sometimes in baiting his critics into even more violent hyper-
bole, and with a good writer's skill he used hyperbole to make his
own points.
There were many fields of human activity in which Bill Douglas
would have made a notable mark in life. In the world of business, as
I suggested; in politics; in education; perhaps even in science. His
exuberant, dynamic energies spilled far beyond the stately processes
of the judiciary and into many other areas of American life as we
know. And we are all richer for his sojourn here.
As I did in paying respects to him at the time of his death, I recall
to you now, in closing, something he said near the end of his active
career on this Court. Here are his words.
"I think the heart of America is sound. I think the conscience of
America is bright, and I think the future, the future of America is
great."
His words should give heart to all of us as we face the future and
remember his rich life.
Adjourned until Monday, December 1, 1980 at 10 o'clock.

The Chief Justice said:
297
"The Court is in special session this afternoon to receive the res-
olutions of the Bar of the Supreme Court in tribute to our colleague,
the late Justice Stanley Reed.
The Solicitor General is recognized at this time for the purpose
of presenting those resolutions which were adopted by the Bar. Mr.
Solicitor General."
Mr. Solicitor General McCree addressed the Court as follows:
"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
RESOLUTIONS
The members of the Bar of the Supreme Court of the United States
have met today in this Court to record our high esteem and affec-
tion for Stanley Forman Reed, who served with exceptional distinc-
tion as an active Associate Justice during nineteen years, from Jan-
uary 31, 1938, until his retirement on February 25, 1957, and after
his retirement continued for many years to render notable service to
the judicial system and to the country.
On the occasion of Justice Reed's retirement in 1957, Chief Justice
Warren, speaking on behalf of the Court, emphasized the fact that
Justice Reed had served with four Chief Justices and eighteen As-
sociate Justices, "all of whom became indebted to him in their joint
work for the Court for the wide range of his knowledge, the depth
of his wisdom, and the warmth of his personality." Chief Justice
Warren said that Justice Reed had "established himself in the hearts
of all of us" and had "made a significant contribution to American
constitutional law."
Justice Reed lived into his ninety-sixth year. His remarkable lon-
gevity exceeded that as yet attained by any other Justice in the his-
tory of the Court. It is one consequence of his full life that we now find
ourselves assessing his contributions with the sharpened perspective
permitted by the passage of nearly a quarter of a century since his re-
tirement. Time has brightened our appreciation of his fine qualities
and our understanding of the wisdom which he brought to the judg-
ments he made in discharging his responsibilities on the Court
throughout a period marked by substantial shifts in emphasis in both
constitutional and statutory doctrine. The tributes bestowed in 1957
were well deserved. We add our hearty endorsement today—and, in
passing along to future generations of the Bar our sentiments concern-
ing this wise and good man, we give renewed expression of the strong
bond of affection for Justice Reed which was always felt by those of
us who knew him best.
Stanley Reed was born in Minerva, Mason County, Kentucky, on
December 31, 1884, and died at Huntington, New York, on April 2,

298
MONDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1980
1980. He was the son of Dr. John A. Reed, a practicing physician, and
Frances Forman Reed. After early schooling Stanley entered Ken-
tucky Wesleyan College, which was then located at Winchester, Ken-
tucky, and he was graduated in 1902. He went on to Yale University
for a second bachelor's degree, conferred in 1906. He next studied law
successively at the University of Virginia Law School, at Columbia
University Law School and at the Sorbonne law faculty in Paris,
without however taking a formal law degree at any one of these in-
stitutions. Meanwhile, in 1908, he married Winifred Elgin, of Mays-
ville, the county seat of Mason County, Kentucky, and when they
returned from the year at the Sorbonne he read law in the office of a
lawyer, in accordance with a practice still common in those days. (He
and Robert H. Jackson were the last of the Supreme Court Justices,
thus far at least, not to have a law degree.) He was admitted to the
Kentucky Bar in 1910, and began to establish a law practice in Mays-
ville. In 1912, and again in 1914, he was elected to the Kentucky Legis-
lature as the representative from Mason County. During World War
I he served as a 1st Lieutenant in the United States Army.
He found law practice challenging and congenial. He was a friendly
man, interested in people and their problems, and interested in the
economic growth and well-being of the region where he lived. As his
clients and friends came to know and to respect the wisdom of his ad-
vice, his practice broadened, with the mix of agriculture, mercantile,
transportation, property and personal matters that came to a good
lawyer in that part of Kentucky.
For about twenty years he continued his practice in Maysville. One
of his clients was the Burley Tobacco Growers Association, a substan-
tial cooperative engaged in marketing the crops of its members. His
experience in this relationship was a contributing factor in his appoint-
ment by President Hoover in 1929 as General Counsel of the Federal
Farm Board, a newly-formed federal agency directed toward farm
credit and the marketing abroad of United States agricultural sur-
pluses. The move to Washington was one of only about five hundred
statute miles, but it involved an enormous change of environment. He
was obliged to leave the neighborhood and local concerns of the Mays-
ville he loved and to concentrate on the issues of national importance
which were to dominate the remainder of his life; Stanley Reed made
the transition quickly and with notable ease.
In December 1932, near the end of the Hoover Administration,
Stanley Reed became General Counsel of the Reconstruction Finance
Corporation, which was embarking on a massive program to help
rescue the country from the depression, and he served in that im-
portant position until March 1935. As General Counsel of the Recon-

MONDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1980
299
struction Finance Corporation, which was a creditor subordinate to
gold-clause bondholders in a railroad reorganization, he in January
1935 joined Attorney General Cummings in arguing the Gold Clause
cases in the Supreme Court (Norman v. B. & O. R. Co., 294 U.S.
240). In this litigation, which he liked to describe as the biggest lawsuit
in history because it affected amounts estimated from seventy-five to
one hundred billion dollars, he successfully warded off attacks on the
validity of the gold-clause legislation that was a keystone of our de-
veloping monetary policy.
Thus Stanley Reed was no stranger to the Department of Justice or
to the Court when on March 18, 1935, President Roosevelt nominated
him to be the Solicitor General of the United States. Within three
days the nomination was confirmed by the Senate and on March 23,
1935, he took up his duties as Solicitor General at a time of unusual
turmoil and excitement in the development of our national institutions
and in the testing of our governing constitutional principles.
Solicitor General Reed discharged his duties as the Government's
chief advocate with distinction. It was a distinction which rested
upon an earthy and a solid foundation, one consisting of a capable
and organized intelligence which first mastered and then clearly ex-
plicated the matter at hand.
His service as Solicitor General came during the most intense
constitutional crisis that the Nation had experienced since the Civil
War. It was a period sometimes characterized as a constitutional
revolution, though he would have called it, persuasively, a consti-
tutional restoration. The Government, and indeed the legal order
itself, were fortunate in having so steady a hand at the controls when
the very foundations of national power were in the balance. He di-
rected the Government's appellate litigaiton and argued a major
share of the constitutional cases-though in that spacious time, when
an hour per side was the normal allotment and two hours were com-
monly allowed in the more important cases, he sometimes shared
the argument with colleagues within the Department or in the agen-
cies involved.
His qualities were those most needed at the time. Without artifice
or the embellishment of rhetoric, with simplicity and candor of state-
ment, with dignity, earnestness, and a hard-earned command of the
record, drawing on briefs that amassed the relevant industrial and
economic facts, Solicitor General Reed clearly won the confidence
and respect of the Court, if not always a majority of the votes.
One corrollary to this careful approach to his job was a high degree
of personal participation in the briefs which bore his name. Prelimi-
nary papers, on certiorari or appeal, were reviewed by him in page

300
MONDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1980
proof. Briefs on the merits were reviewed, searchingly rather than
perfunctorily, before printing. Briefs in important cases (which
arose in some profusion in those times) were discussed and developed
around his desk.
In the 33 months of his service as Solicitor General, Stanley Reed
argued 18 cases, reported in the 295th to the 303rd United States Re-
ports. For a time during this period it seemed as if the basic constitu-
tional powers of Congress, to tax and to regulate commerce among
the states, would be rendered inadequate to deal with the deep-seated
problems of the national economy and welfare. Stanley Reed lost
his arguments for the validity of the National Industrial Recovery
Act and of the Agricultural Adjustment Act (Schechter Corp. v.
United States, 295 U.S. 495; United States v. Butler, 297 U.S. 1)
but so, in 1935, would Demosthenes assisted by Daniel Webster. In
cases argued for the Government by others, the Bituminous Coal Act,
and, most singular of all, the Railroad Pension Act, likewise suc-
cumbed to attacks on constitutional grounds (Carter v. Carter Coal
Co., 298 U.S. 238; Railroad Retirement Bd. v. Alton R. Co., 295 U.S.
330). But before the close of his term as Solicitor General the con-
stitutional foundations of national power had been recovered.
Solicitor General Reed successfully argued, or shared the argument,
in the cases upholding the National Labor Relations Act (Labor Board
v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U.S. 1; Labor Board v. Fruehauf
Co., 301 U.S. 49), the cases interposing barriers of standing which
substantially immunized from attack the Public Works and Tennessee
Valley legislation (Ashwander v. Valley Authority, 297 U.S. 288;
Alabama Power Co. v. Ickes, 302 U.S. 464), and the cases starting the
Court's retreat from the overblown application of the doctrine of in-
tergovernmental tax immunities (James v. Dravo Contracting Co., 302
U.S. 134; Silas Mason Co. v. Tax Commission, 302 U.S. 186; Helver-
ing v. Therrell, 303 U.S. 218).
To these landmarks may be added his winning arguments in the
case sustaining the windfall income tax, which recovered the agricul-
tural adjustment processing tax refunds from those who had already
recouped from their purchasers (Anniston Mfg. Co. v. Davis, 301 U.S.
337), and in the case sustaining the Executive Agreement provi-
sions transferring private expropriation claims against the U.S.S.R. to
the United States (United States v. Belmont, 301 U.S. 324), along
with his unsuccessful defense of President Roosevelt's removal of a
Federal Trade Commissioner from office (Humphrey's Executor v.
United States, 295 U.S. 602). Probably no other attorney has plunged
so deeply into the basic law of our Nation in so short a time.
Success as Solicitor General was not measured by victories alone,
crucial as those were for the future course of our national life. Stanley

Reed was conscious of an obligation to help in rationalizing the law,
apart from particular outcomes. He, as others in this high office, was
careful never to seek victory for its own sake and he avoided making
arguments which he considered deleterious to the law.
Solicitor General Reed served nearly three years in that office. In
January, 1938, the retirement of Justice Sutherland offered President
Roosevelt his second appointment to the Court. It was fitting that he
chose the chief advocate for his Administration. Stanley Reed was
nominated and, after only ten days, then confirmed. The Congressional
Record for January 25 reports the debate in full: "Without objection,
the nomination is confirmed." He took his seat on the bench on Jan-
uary 31, 1938. A few days earlier, Justice Stone had written to Pro-
fessor Felix Frankfurther:
"I am quite happy about Reed's appointment. He is honest,
straightforward, and a hard worker and I think a good law-
yer. The Court ought to get many years of good service from
him when he settles into the new job."
Justice Reed was in active service on this Court for more than
nineteen years, from his 54th to his 73d years. At his retirement he
had served for one-ninth of the history of this Court. He wrote a total
of 339 opinions, which will be found in the 303rd to the 352nd of the
United States Reports. Of this total there were 231 (a little over two-
thirds) written for the Court, and 20 concurring opinions and 88
dissenting opinions. Their subject matter touches upon virtually every-
thing that arises within the wide range of the Court's business.
Assessed as a whole, and even when read again a quarter of a century
later, their quality is high. The style tends to be steady and clear; the
flow of the argument usually is carefully developed; the scholarly and
legislative materials are skillfully used, without being allowed to be-
come smothering; and there is a sufficient brevity to help assure that
the opinions will be read by a wide audience and readily understood.
The issues to which Justice Reed directed his opinions came in all
shapes and all sizes. They could be as simple as his first opinion,
holding that a bankruptcy commissioner was not personally liable
because he paid for the cost of growing and harvesting crops given
as security (Adair v. Bank of America Assn., 303 U.S. 350), or as com-
plex as the milk orders issued by the Secretary of Agriculture under
the Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 (U.S. v. Rock Royal Co-Op.,
307 U.S. 533). They could address issues as elusive as the close ques-
tion of statutory construction whereby, for a 4-3 majority, he held
that the Texas City disaster fell outside the scope of the liability
which the Congress had imposed on the Government by the provisions
of the Federal Tort Claims Act (Dalehite v. United States, 346 U.S.

302
MONDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1980
15), or as precise as, in his final opinion for the Court, whether the
Federal Black Bass Act, forbidding transporation contrary to state
law, reached to violations of state administrative regulations (United
States v. Howard, 352 U.S. 212). They could seem, at least by hindsight
to reach a result as inevitable as the decisions sustaining the F.C.C.'s
rules adopted for the purpose of avoiding overconcentration in the
broadcasting industry (U.S. v. Storer Broadcasting Co., 351 U.S. 192),
or outlawing the white primary in Texas (Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S.
649); or they might involve as hard a call as the cellophane anti-
trust case (United States v. DuPont & Co., 351 U.S. 377). What is
constant in the diversity of his opinions is the care of the exposition,
and the patient organization of his march from initial premise to final
conclusion.
U.S. v. Amer. Trucking Ass'ns, 310 U.S. 534, was one of Justice
Reed's unusual departures from the conventions of the law. There the
Court felt obliged to force the contrary words of a carelessly-drafted
floor amendment into the result intended by the Congress, as plainly
shown by the legislative history. Justice Reed was clear that, in depart-
ing from the plain words of the statute, he had entered upon treach-
erous ground and gave explicit recognition to the "danger that the
Court's conclusion as to the legislative purpose will be unconsciously
influenced by the judges' own views ***. A lively appreciation of
the danger is the best assurance of escape from its threat."
In his relations with his colleagues, with his law clerks and with
the members of the Bar, Justice Reed displayed unusual degrees of
friendliness, serenity and generosity. Great issues might be at stake;
deeply-held opposing views might be in stark confrontation-but no
matter what the temptation or the provocation, he behaved with un-
failing civility and sought always to nurture a spirit of mutual
respect.
These qualities in no way meant that he was lacking in abiding con-
victions on fundamental issues—such as issues involving the distribu-
tion of powers between the Federal Government and the States, or
the balancing of the interests of the Government and the individual
under the Bill of Rights, or the development of limits on the scope of
judicial review. He was willing to listen, to consider the views of
others, and sometimes to be persuaded by them. But when all the dis-
cussion was finished, he had a sense of independent self-assurance
which gave him a quiet though firm confidence in the correctness of
his own judgments.
Toward the latter part of Justice Reed's tenure the school desegre-
gation cases presented the Court with issues of almost unparallelled
importance. The unanimity of all the Justices which found expres-

MONDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1980
303
sion in the opinion finally issued in Brown v. Board of Education,
347 U.S. 483, constitutes perhaps the most dramatic triumph of col-
legial persuasion in the history of the Court. It is known from his-
torical accounts already published, based on documents and other data
available to scholars, that Justice Reed initially felt that the segre-
gated school systems there in controversy were not unconstitutional
and that he contemplated the possibility of issuing a separate opinion
so stating. But over the Court's long internal consideration of the case
he came to acquiesce in the contrary conclusion reached by his brethren
and he decided it would be better for the Nation's future if he joined
in what would thus become a unanimous opinion.
Justice Reed was throughout his service on the Court its quintes-
sential moderate. His moderation reflected not an indifference to
principle, but an aversion to rigid doctrine, and especially to the
doctrinaire. His pragmatic recognition that even first principles
cannot be pushed to their logical extreme is well shown by Breard v.
Alexandria, 341 U.S. 622. The Court there sustained the "Green
River" ordinances, requiring the prior consent of the resident before
allowing door-to-door commercial solicitation. Justices Black and
Douglas considered application of the ordinances to the sale of
periodicals a violation of the First Amendment. Justice Reed replied
that it would seem "a misuse of the great guarantees of free speech
and free press to use those guarantees to force a community to admit
the solicitors of publications to the home premises of its residents."
So, too, what seems to be a high-water mark during the last half
century for the antitrust rule of reason is found in his opinion for
the Court in United States v. Steel Co., 334 U.S. 495. There the
Court by 5-4 vote held vertical integration of a large steel producer
with a large fabricator was not per se unlawful, but permissible if
major competition remained; Justice Reed was not persuaded by the
insistence of the dissent that U.S. Steel "is big enough."
Stanley Reed had, however, no attachment to moderation in the
dispatch of the business for which he was responsible. He was in-
sistent as Solicitor General that his Office should not ask for exten-
sions of time-both as a matter of pride and in recognition that this
only served to compress the time available for succeeding matters. He
thus inaugurated a tradition that endured in that Office for at least
a decade or two.
Justice Reed brought with him to the Court this aversion to delay,
and nourished it throughout his service. His first opinion for the
Court was delivered 26 days after argument, his last only 39 days
after argument. In all, he maintained this expedition as a result of
steady and determined workmanship throughout his service on the
Court.

304
MONDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1980
Justice Reed had not served out his first year on the Court when
he accepted an extracurricular chore of the first importance. On
January 31, 1939, President Roosevelt made him Chairman of the
President's Committee on Civil Service Improvement. This was a
small group of distinquished judges, officials and citizens who were
asked to recommend ways to achieve professional excellence in a
career civil service. Justice Reed in accepting the assignment was
able to crystallize his enduring concern for the excellence of the Fed-
eral personnel. The Committee's report, two years later, led to some
improvement in respect to most of the professions studied. Its recom-
mendation as to lawyers was the most far reaching. There, for the
two years during which it had the support of the Congress, it pro-
duced a spectacular improvement in the systems for recruiting and
selecting attorneys. The Reed Committee, as it was then known, was
able to combine the energies and wisdom of a strikingly diverse group
only because of the consistently gracious leadership of its chairman,
experienced both in the professional needs of the Government and in
the patient skill required to bring together the widely separated views
of strong-willed men.
When he retired from the Court in 1957 Justice Reed was in good
health, with the expectation of continuing his activity though on a re-
duced scale. He wrote to his law clerks:
"My plans look forward to opportunities for aiding in im-
provements in the law, its administration, and its adaptation
to new conditions. After more than fifty years in its study and
practice, our Lady of the Law retains my deepest affection."
During the years that followed he delivered some occasional addresses
on subjects close to his heart. He performed a constructive role as
Special Master in an orginal action brought in this Court between two
States seeking a resolution of their dispute concerning oystering and
other fishing in the Potomac (Virginia v. Maryland, 355 U.S. 946 and
371 U.S. 943). But he found the greatest opportunity for service by
sitting from time to time, pursuant to the designations permitted by
statute, on panels of judges adjudicating cases in the United States
Court of Claims and in the United States Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit. There his fellow judges had the benefit
of his wisdom and his experience; and he took his turn at the writing
of opinions. One which should be especially noted deals with the com-
plex subject of the scope of the Government's executive privilege to
withhold documents from disclosure in litigation (Kaiser Aluminum
& Chemical Corp. v. United States, 141 Ct. Cl. 38). He continued to sit
until the early part of 1970, though with decreasing frequency, after
which he concluded that advancing age made it desirable to retire more
definitively.

Throughout his life Stanley Reed kept his intimate ties with his
beloved Kentucky. Year after year he and his wife Winifred re-
turned there during the summer to renew old friendships and to make
new ones. For many years he retained an interest in a family working
farm property in Maysville, and even in the midst of a busy Court
term he would seem to find relaxation and pleasure in going over its
operating records and books of account. The pride which his fellow-
Kentuckians took in his accomplishments never ruffled his modesty;
he reciprocated with an expansive warmth of feeling toward them.
Wherefore, it is accordingly
RESOLVED, that we, the Bar of the Supreme Court of the United
States, express our lasting and grateful appreciation for the exemplary
service rendered by Stanley Forman Reed during his long public
career, first in the Legislature of Kentucky, then in the Executive
Branch of the United States Government, then as a distinguished
Associate Justice of this Court, and later as a retired Associate Justice;
that we record our high affection and esteem for him, and our admira-
tion for the qualities of wise judgment, of diligent and perceptive
craftsmanship, and of personal generosity and gentlemanliness, which
enabled him to be so effective in contributing to the progress of the law
and to the betterment of our Nation; and it is further
RESOLVED, that the Solicitor General be asked to present these
Resolutions to the Court and that the Attorney General be asked to
move that they be inscribed upon the Court's permanent records.
Submitted by the Committee on Resolutions: Bennett Boskey,
Chairman, A. B. Chandler, Clark M. Clifford, Bert T. Combs, John
Sherman Cooper, Thomas G. Corcoran, George Clifton Edwards, Jr.,
Paul A. Freund, Warner W. Gardner, Bayless Manning, Carl D.
Perkins, William D. Rogers, J. Skelly Wright."
The Chief Justice said:
"Thank you, Mr. Solicitor General. The Court now recognizes the
Attorney General of the United States."
Mr. Attorney General Civiletti addressed the Court as follows:
"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
The Bar of the Court met today to honor the memory of Stanley F.
Reed, who served as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court from
1938 to 1957.
Mr. Justice Reed was the second Justice appointed to the Court by
President Franklin Roosevelt. Like Mr. Justice Black, who immedi-
ately preceded him to the Bench, Stanley Reed brought to the Court
the perspective of one who helped shape national policy in the service
of a coordinate Branch of Government during the New Deal period, an
era that transformed American politics, government, and, ultimately,

306
MONDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1980
constitutional doctrine. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation, of
which he was General Counsel from 1932 to 1935, participated in nu-
merous governmental efforts to revitalize the economy, furnishing
loans and equity capital to banks and businesses and providing the
essential financial underpinning for New Deal initiatives in such areas
as agricultural price supports, rural electrification, housing, and ex-.
port trade. As General Counsel, Stanley Reed overcame misgivings on
the part of the Secretary of the Treasury and rendered a decisive legal
opinion supporting the RFC's authority to purchase newly mined gold
in furtherance of the Roosevelt Administration's monetary policy.¹
And also while General Counsel, Stanley Reed argued on behalf of
RFC in the Gold Clause Cases,2 in which the Court upheld the power
of Congress to provide that contracts purporting to require payment
in gold or particular coin or currency could be satisfied upon payment
of any legal tender. His success in the Gold Clause Cases no doubt was
a significant factor in his being selcted, one month later, to be Solici-
tor General of the United States.
Stanley Reed's tenure as Solicitor General came at the turning point
of the most severe testing of congressional power since the days of
Chief Justice Marshall, a testing occasioned by Congress and the
Executive's pursuit of extraordinary measures to master the condi-
tions of the Great Depression. In less than three years, he presented
the government's cause, or superintended its presentation, in a series
of cases whose very names have come to symbolize the tension that
then existed between the political and judicial branches of govern-
ment. His argument in support of the National Industrial Recovery
Act was rejected by the Court in Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United
States,3 less than three months after he became Solicitor General. The
Guffey Coal Act and the Agricultural Adjustment Act met a similar
fate in Carter v. Carter Coal Co., and United States v. Butler, 5
although in the latter case the Court did accept the broad Hamiltonian
view, urged by Solicitor General Reed, of Congress power to tax and
spend for the general welfare.
But there were important successes as well, especially toward the
end of his tenure. Solicitor General Reed successfully defended the
constitutionality of the sale of power by the Tennessee Valley Au-
thority in Ashwander v. TVA, and, at his urging, the Court unani-
mously rejected a challenge to the federal financing of municipal

power plants in Alabama Power Co. v. Ickes. In Carmichael v. South-
ern Coal Co. and Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, 10 both decided in
1937, the Court sustained the cooperative state and federal unem-
ployment compensation system and, of equal importance, the power
of Congress to offer financial inducements to the States to encourage.
them to participate in federal programs. The congressional policy
favoring collective bargaining was broadly affirmed for the first
time by the unanimous decision in Virginia Railway Co. v. System
Federation No. 40,¹¹ also argued by Solicitor General Reed. But
perhaps the most significant of his successes was in National Labor
Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Corp., 12 in which the Court up-
held the Wagner Act and, in the process, adopted a more expansive
view of Congress power to regulate interstate commerce than had
been reflected in the Court's prior opinions during this period.
11
Thus, when Stanley Reed was appointed an Associate Justice of
this Court in 1938, he of course possessed an intimate knowledge of its
procedures, gained through his meticulous attention to the govern-
ment's business before the Court. But he also brought to the Court a
special sensitivity to the role of the Court under the Constitution and
a unique understanding of the processes of government and the great
issues of his time.
Consistent with his experience, Mr. Justice Reed generally exhibited
a broad view of the power of Congress to address the economic and
social needs of the Nation. In his first few years on the bench, he joined
in the Court's affirmation of the constitutional principles respecting
Congress authority to regulate interstate commerce that only had
begun to emerge in his years as Solicitor General. In United States v.
Darby, 13 for example, Mr. Justice Reed joined the unanimous opinion
of the Court overruling its decision two decades earlier in Hammer v.
Dagenhart 14 and sustaining the power of Congress to regulate the
working conditions of persons who produce goods destined for inter-
state commerce. In this same area, it was particularly fitting that Mr.
Justice Reed should write the opinion for the Court in United States
v. Rock Royal Co-Operative, Inc., 15 which sustained the authority of
Congress to regulate the price and conditions of marketing of agri-
cultural commodities in interstate commerce. The Court held that
Congress could regulate local sales of products where those sales are
drawn into a plan to protect interstate commerce from the effects of

agricultural surpluses 16-a marked departure from the pronouncement
in United States v. Butler that any regulation of agricultural produc-
tion was a local matter reserved exclusively to the States." And the
Court in Rock Royal Co-Operative, Inc., approved the delegation of
authority to the Secretary of Agriculture to maintain orderly market-
ing conditions, finding that the inclusion of identifiable standards to
guide the Secretary sufficiently distinguished the case from Schechter
Poultry. In another landmark decision under the Commerce Clause,
Mr. Justice Reed delivered the opinion of the Court in United States
v. Appalachian Power Co., 18 which established Congress authority to
regulate the use of navigable waters in all their aspects.19
Mr. Justice Reed similarly believed that substantial deference
should be given to the judgment of the Executive or of federal
agencies where Congress had chosen to rely on their expertise and
discretion to implement statutory policy. "It is not the province of a
court," he observed in Gray v. Powell,20 "to absorb the administrative
functions to such an extent that the executive or legislative agencies
become mere fact-finding bodies deprived of the advantages of
prompt and definite action." But he was equally plain in Stark v.
Wickard,¹ decided several terms later in 1944, that "the responsibility
of determining the limits of statutory grants of authority in such
instances is a judicial function entrusted to the courts by Congress."
As Mr. Justice Reed's service on the Court proceeded, issues of
race and civil liberties began to overshadow those of the distribution
of powers in our federal system. He uniformly voted with the majority
in cases involving racial discrimination, including a series of decisions
requiring admission of blacks to graduate schools, 22 and, of course,
the Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education. 23 And he wrote
the opinion of the Court in Smith v. Allwright, 24 one of the "white
primary" cases, and in Morgan v. Virginia, 25 finding a state statute
requiring racial segregation of passengers traveling interstate to
be an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce.
Mr. Justice Reed's judicial philosophy was more multifaceted in
cases involving an accommodation of First Amendment rights and the
interests of society. He generally voted to uphold statutes or programs
designed to identify or protect against perceived threats to national

security. But in other areas, he agreed with Mr. Justice Black and
Justice Douglas that freedom of expression enjoys a preferred status
under the Constitution and he insisted on broad protections for the
exercise of that freedom. He delivered the opinion of the Court in
Pennekamp v. Florida," which, building upon the decision in Bridges
v. California,28 concluded that the press criticism of judicial conduct
there at issue did not present such a clear and immediate threat to the
administration of justice as to justify "clos[ing] the door of permis-
sible public comment.” “When that door is closed," he observed, “it
closes all doors behind it." 29
Mr. Justice Reed would have given broader protection to labor
picketing than did the Court, 30 and he cast the crucial fifth vote in
Terminiello v. Chicago,³¹ which reversed the conviction of an individ-
ual whose speech had created a disturbance. But his decision for the
Court in United Public Workers v. Mitchell 32 demonstrates perhaps
as well as any his conviction that due respect for the rights of the
individual must take into account the broader interests of society and
the proper working of our public institutions. For as important as the
First Amendment rights of government employees were recognized to
be, Mr. Justice Reed upheld the legitimacy of Congress judgment
that the cumulative effect of partisan political activity by many public
employees would threaten the very democratic system that the First
Amendment was intended to serve.
Upon the occasion of his appointment to the Bench, the editors of
the American Bar Association Journal observed that a key to part of
Mr. Justice Reed's legal philosophy could be found in a quotation from
an address he had given several years earlier:
[E]xperience of the last half century has driven us to the
realization that, after all, we live in a factual world where
organized groups, whether for production, commerce or prop-
aganda, are too powerful to permit the feeble forces of the
individual to survive. *** Regretfully but inevitably we
must adjust our lives and our Government to modern needs
and find, in a Constitution written for a simpler era, guidance
for the problems of our present age.33

MONDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1980
Mr. Justice Reed believed in the value of organization to counter-
balance the forces he perceived to be threatening to the individual―
whether it be the organization of farmers in the tobacco cooperative
he represented in Kentucky; of working people in the labor unions
whose rights he defended before and as a member of this Court; or
of the people generally, through their government, to further the
common good. Others, on this Court and elsewhere, may have disagreed ⠀
with some of his views. But whatever the passions surrounding a
particular cause, Stanley Reed brought to the occasion a civility,
kindness, fairness, and care that commanded the affection and respect
of all who knew him.
Mr. Chief Justice, in the name of the lawyers of this nation and,
in particular, of the bar of this Court, I respectfully request that the
resolutions presented to you in honor and celebration of the memory
of the late Mr. Justice Reed be accepted by this Court."
The Chief Justice said: "Mr. Attorney General and Mr. Solicitor
General, the Court thanks you for your presentations here today in
memory of our late colleague Justice Reed.
We ask that you convey to the members of the Committee of the
Bar, the Committee on Resolutions, our appreciation for their very
appropriate presentation, and your motion that these resolutions be
made part of the permanent records of the Court is granted.
Stanley Reed's career as a lawyer, as a Government official, and as a
jurist, was a life of consistent, sustained excellence. In his own quiet,
unobtrusive, imperturbable, and conscientious manner he rendered
very distinguished service to our country in a period of great political
and social turbulence.
After he had completed his education at the various universities
described in the resolutions, Stanley Reed returned to his hometown
of Maysville and both studied and practiced law, and it did not take
long for his professional reputation to spread. And although he was a
leading Kentucky Democrat, he became Counsel for the Federal
Farm Board and then General Counsel of the Reconstruction Finance
Corporation in the administration of President Hoover.
By the time President Roosevelt took office in 1933, Stanley Reed's
reputation was so firmly established in Washington that he was con-
tinued in office. He could, as has been suggested, accurately be described
as a moderate, one who believed that much good could be done when
Government power is wielded firmly and discerningly in the public
interest. As the Attorney General has said, when he became Solicitor
General he had already argued one of the Gold Clause cases before
this Court, and during the dynamic period that followed 1935 he
argued most of the important cases involving the constitutionality of

MONDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1980
311
President Roosevelt's New Deal legislation. And in that process, in
this Court, at this lectern, he was opposed by some of the finest, ablest
lawyers in America.
As Solicitor General his performance was always marked by
thoroughness of preparation and his arguments were characterized
by clear, down to earth presentations, and his tenure embraced, as has
been stated, many of the great landmarks of our constitutional law.
The pressures on an advocate responsible for so many highly charged
cases with one coming on the heels of another finally took their toll,
and on one occasion, in the course of his argument at this lectern, he
collapsed. But happily it was from sheer exhaustion, and he swiftly
recovered.
Homer Cummings, the Attorney General in Roosevelt's first two
terms, once said that Stanley Reed was qualified to fill any post in
the Government. And so it came as no surprise, soon after that, that
President Roosevelt selected him to succeed Justice Sutherland on this
Court. By that time his reputation in the bar of this country was such
that the appointment was widely acclaimed. There were those who
were quick to predict that Reed, the jurist, would act based upon the
work of Reed, the advocate. But when Stanley Reed came to this Bench
his conduct fulfilled the great traditions of the Judiciary and his posi-
tions as an advocate were set aside, and he was the pure judge.
As one born and bred a Southern Democrat, he believed with Jef-
ferson that a Court entrusted with the great power of judicial review
should not confuse its role with the role and function of the political
branches of the Government. It is told that once one of his law clerks
suggested to him that he ought to decide cases more often by looking
to the desirable solution. But that was not the case for Stanley Reed.
The proper function of a Justice, he said, was not to do that. He was
not a result-oriented, or a problem-solving judge. And so he sent the
errant law clerk to look up the word 'kritarchy.' The law clerk, on
going to several dictionaries, had some difficulty, but finally he tracked
down the word in the unabridged Oxford Dictionary and discovered,
and I think, perhaps, never forgot that the word means "government
by judges," which Stanley Reed rejected.
Throughout his judicial career he sought always to restrain him-
self from reaching desirable results because they harmonized with a
particular social philosophy or a personal belief of his own. As one
reared in a border state, he made a major contribution in helping this
Nation to move toward racial equality and, as has been said already,
wrote the opinions in cases where the all-white primary elections and
segregation in interstate transportation were held unconstitutional.

312
MONDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1980
He approached the Court's opinion in Brown v. Board of Education
cautiously, because he weighed whether the decision might impede
rather than assist race relations in the country, and in his thoughtful
and careful way he later called Brown the most important decision of
this Court in the 19 years he served here.
During that period he authored 231 opinions for the Court, 20 con-
curring opinions, and 88 dissents. He was a superb colleague, and I can
say that from personal experience, as I will indicate. He was devoted
to his office, a prodigious, conscientious, painstaking workman.
There was nothing in him of the prima donna. Serious and modest
and retiring, he was always courtly. He went about his daily tasks
quietly and always serenely. His unfailing courtesy to counsel from
this Bench and with his colleagues, his even temper, his dry sense of
humor, endeared him to everyone. He was a moderate in all things, and
he exemplified the virtues of the true 18th century gentleman, the epi-
tome of civility.
When he retired from the Court he was in good health, and 72 years
of age. And as the Attorney General and Solicitor General have said,
it was his lot to live longer after his retirement than any Justice in the
history of the Court. And he enjoyed those years, more than two dec-
ades, fully. He maintained chambers here, in this Court, and like Tom
Clark continued to render very important service to other Federal
courts, and as a Special Master appointed by this Court.
He sat by designation on more than 250 cases in the United States
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia while I was a member
of that court, and he sat on the United States Court of Claims. I had
argued cases before him when he was on this Court. But I really came
to know him when he sat with us on the Court of Appeals, where he
was a regular member of panels for about four years. He maintained
chambers at the Court of Appeals, and joined us at the judges' lunch
table and often regaled us with stories of Kentucky and of the New
Deal days when he was Solicitor General.
He not only lived longer after his retirement than any other
Justice-surely no other Justice lived a fuller life than Stanley Reed.
It was rich in satisfactions and in the kind of rewards that endure. In
our time when the stability of family life has been eroded, we who
knew him well know of the joy of his marriage to his hometown
sweetheart, Winifred Elgin, and of the pride he took in his two
lawyer sons. He often said, "All the success I have had in my life I owe
to my wife, the beautiful Winifred." They were married 71 years, and
Mrs. Reed, as we know, survives him.
Kentucky has contributed mightily to the history of this Court.
Ten of the 101 Justices who have served, and including those who now

MONDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1980
313
serve, were either native or adopted Kentuckians, and that included
Stanley Reed's lifelong friend, Chief Justice Vinson. As a Kentuckian
he never lost his great affection for his native State. He used to speak
of his forebears who, as he once wrote, "Before we were a Nation they
traversed the wilderness road to the bluegrass country."
He was proud of his Kentucky roots, of his membership in the
Kentucky Bar for more than 70 years, of his service in the Kentucky
General Assembly. He loved his farm in Kentucky, and he would tell
us with a smile that he had worked for 56 years in order to maintain his
dairy cows on his farm in the manner to which they had become
accustomed.
Stanley Reed smiled often, and in the two decades that I knew him
well he and Winifred dined at our home and we dined in theirs. His
delights in small, gentle banter is revealed in an exchange in our home
when I served him some predinner refreshment that was laced with
mint. He asked in that courtly way of his, "Where did this come from,
if I may inquire?" And I responded, "Why, of course, the only place
where real bourbon is made."
Beginning in the first year when I came to this Court, and he came
to my chambers about this time or a little later, each year, bearing a
package of Kentucky's famous produce, I in turn would send him a
bottle of bordeaux or of burgundy each Christmas. And with a smile
again, as he was wont to do, he would say, sometimes, "This is tolerable
if there is no Kentucky wine available."
As Stanley Reed never forgot Kentucky, Kentucky never forgot
him, and he was invited back frequently to speak on a great many
occasions. In 1957 his hometown of Maysville observed "Stanley Reed
Day" in his honor. The street where he had maintained his law office.
was named for him.
At his death the Maysville newspaper wrote that "We here as fel-
low townsmen feel that the Nation was the richer for his shining in-
tegrity, and the depth of his wisdom." And surely we here today can
share that.
It is appropriate, I think, to conclude our tributes to our colleague
with words from a poem written by Alice Roberts on Stanley Reed Day.
She wrote this:
'He will go back to quiet lanes
Where cities' hum shall cease,
To walk again the gentle ways,
The paths of rest and peace.'

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Present: Chief Justice Burger, Justice Brennan, Justice Stewart,
Justice White, Justice Marshall, Justice Blackmun, Justice Powell,
Justice Rehnquist, and Justice Stevens.
The Chief Justice said:
"Before we turn to the regular business of the Court on today's
calendar, we wish to take note of the retirement of Justice Stewart as
a member of the Court. Our tribute to him as a colleague and friend is
expressed in a letter to him signed by all other members of the Court.
That letter and Justice Stewart's response will be made part of the
journal of today's proceedings.
"Justice Stewart's 23 years on this Court embrace a stirring period
of major political, economic and social changes in our country. As
Lord Bryce and others observed many years ago, most of the problems
of the changes in our society have a way of finding their way into this
Court. This is not-as some observers erroneously suggest-that courts
reach out for these problems. On the contrary, the problems are thrust
upon the courts. This trend has shown a marked acceleration in recent
years. As it increases, the mythology of the courts' seeking out con-
troversies expands apace.
"In this period Justice Stewart has sought constantly to maintain a
balanced view of the role of the judiciary as one limited by precedent
and tradition as well as by the Constitution itself. He has sought to
preserve appropriate boundaries consistent with the constitutional
duties placed on the judiciary by article III. His opinions particularly
reflect his strong views on guarantees of individual liberty and free-
dom of expression and those views make up a substantial body of our
jurisprudence of the past two decades."
Our letter to Justice Stewart is as follows:
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES,
Washington, D.C., July 2, 1981.
CHAMBERS OF THE CHIEF JUSTICE
DEAR POTTER: Your decision to retire from the Court took most by
surprise and even after several weeks we are not fully reconciled. We
respect your view that "twenty-three years is enough" but you will be
missed in the deliberations at the conference table where your close.
grasp of the cases decided during your long tenure-as well as those
before—were a very valuable resource to the Court.
You have had a long tenure on the Court, but we know that longevity
is but one measure of the contribution of a Justice. You have combined
more than two decades here with more than a quarter of a century of
judicial service in a period of significant changes in the law and your
important contributions are a matter of record.

THURSDAY, JULY 2, 1981
Apart from our work as colleagues, as friends we will miss these
regular contacts with you on the bench and in conference. However,
although it goes without saying, we firmly assert that we expect you
to share our table as you have for 23 years at the Court. A long and
close relationship such as we share here, is not to be changed on the
personal level by the act of retirement.
All of us join in repeating to you and Andy our heartfelt wishes
for continued good health and for many good years ahead.
Sincerely,
Justice Stewart's response is as follows:
Warren E. Burger.
William J. Brennan, Jr.
Byron R. White.
Thurgood Marshall.
Harry A. Blackmun.
Lewis F. Powell, Jr.
William H. Rehnquist.
John Paul Stevens.
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES,
Washington, D.C., July 2, 1981.
CHAMBERS OF JUSTICE POTTER STEWART
MY DEAR COLLEAGUES, Your kind letter has greatly touched Andy
and me. The decision to retire was not easy, but it would have been
much harder without the knowledge that in my retirement our friend-
ship will continue unaffected.
I shall greatly miss participating with you in the work of the Court.
But, though no longer a professional colleague, I shall look forward
with happiness to the personal companionship of each of you in the
years ahead.
Best wishes to you all.
Sincerely yours,
OPINIONS
POTTER STEWART.

No. 80-2127. Iran National Airlines Corp., et al., appellants, v.
The Marschalk Company, Inc., et al. Certified question from United
States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. It is the opinion of this
Court that the questions certified by the United States Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit must be answered as follows:
(1). Yes. See Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U.S. —
(2). Yes. See Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U.S. —
(3). The President's action in nullifying the attachments did not
constitute a taking of property for which compensation must be paid.
We dismiss question (3) so far as it concerns whether the action of the
President in suspending the claims constituted a taking of property for
which compensation must be paid. See Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453
U.S. (1981). Justice Powell, with whom Justice Marshall and
Justice Stevens join, dissenting: I would dismiss the certificate, citing
Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U.S. – (1981), announced today.
The Court's opinion in that case provides the only answers that this
Court should give to the questions certified to us by the United States
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Having rendered an opinion
on the subject of those questions, we should not answer them in mono-
syllables nor attempt a syllabus of a portion of the Court's opinion.
We recently have dismissed certification of questions where the Court
has addressed the subject of the questions in a full opinion. Foley v.
Carter, 449 U.S. (1981). See also United States v. Will, 449 U.S.
(1981).
