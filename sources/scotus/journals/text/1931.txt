"August 20, 1912, the earliest date claimed for Langmuir, was re-

Langmuir was anticipated by Arnold in November, 1912. But be-
fore the earlier date,"

lowing:
"By August, 1912, the Telegraph Company used De Forest am-
plifying audions at 54 volts, and, by November, they were used by

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Present: The Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Van Devanter, Mr. Jus-
tice McReynolds, Mr. Justice Brandeis, Mr. Justice Sutherland, Mr.
Justice Butler, Mr. Justice Stone, and Mr. Justice Roberts.
M. Lewis Hall, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Henry T. Golightly, of

mitted to practice.
The Chief Justice announced the following orders of the Court:
No. 1. Akron, Canton & Youngstown Railway Company et al.,
appellants, v. The United States of America et al. Appeal from
the District Court of the United States for the Northern District
of Illinois. Per curiam: The Court is of the opinion that the Inter-
state Commerce Commission acted within its authority and that
its order is supported by substantial evidence. The decree is affirmed.
Western Chemical Company v. United States, 271 U. S. 268, 271;
Chicago, R. I. & P. R'y Co. v. United States, 274 U. S. 29, 33, 34, Ala-
bama et al. v. United States, 283 U. S. 776, 779.
No. 2. The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company et al., appel-
lants, v. Allen J. Maxwell, Commissioner of Revenue of North
Carolina. Appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of North
Carolina. Per curiam: Judgment affirmed. State Board of Tax
Commissioners v. Jackson, 283 U. S. 527.
Mr. Justice Van Devanter and Mr. Justice Sutherland concur in
the judgment solely upon the ground that the decision in State
Board of Tax Commissioners v. Jackson, supra, is in point and con-
trolling; but if the question were still open they would regard the
taxing act as repugnant to the equal protection clause of the four-
teenth amendment for the reasons stated in the dissenting opinion
in the Jackson case.
Mr. Justice McReynolds and Mr. Justice Butler are of opinion
that the challenged judgment should be reversed.

MONDAY, OCTOBER 26, 1931

No. 5. George T. Mitchell, Attorney General of the State of Missis-
sippi, et al., etc., appellants, v. Penny Stores, Incorporated. Appeal
from the District Court of the United States for the Southern Dis-
trict of Mississippi. Per curiam: In this suit, brought to enjoin
the enforcement of the provisions of sections 2 (c), 11, and 13 of
article 1 of chapter 90 of the Laws of Mississippi of 1930, an appli-
cation was made to the District Court of the United States for an
interlocutory injunction. The District Court, composed of three
judges (U. S. C., title 28, sec. 380), granted an interlocutory injunc-
tion upon the giving by the plaintiffs of a bond payable to the State
of Mississippi in the sum of $5,000, conditioned as required by law,
restraining the enforcement of the statutory provisions until the
cause could be fully heard and determined. No opinion was ren-
dered by the District Court, and the only question presented by the
record upon this appeal is whether the District Court abused its
discretion in granting an injunction until the case could be heard
upon the merits. Alabama et al. v. United States, 279 U. S. 229,
231; United Fuel Gas Co. v. Public Service Commission, 278 U. S.
322, 326; National Fire Insurance Co. v. Thompson, 281 U. S. 331,
338. The order was made prior to the decision of this Court in
State Board of Commissioners v. Jackson, 283 U. S. 527, and, as
no abuse of discretion is shown, the order must be affirmed.
No. 21. The Virginian Railway Company, petitioner, v. Boyd E.
Chambers;
No. 22. The Virginian Railway Company, petitioner, v. E. L.
Fitzgerald; and
No. 23. The Virginian Railway Company, petitioner, v. W. O.
Hylton. On writs of certiorari to the United States Circuit Court
of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Per curiam: Judgments
affirmed by a divided court.
No. 25. City of Chicago, appellant, v. Chicago Rapid Transit
Company. Appeal from the District Court of the United States
for the Northern District of Illinois. Per curiam: This suit was
brought to restrain the Illinois Commerce Commission and the At-
torney General of the State of Illinois from enforcing an order of
the commission prescribing rates of fare upon the appellee's rail-
roads upon the ground that the order was confiscatory and in viola-
tion of the fourteenth amendment of the Constitution of the United
States. The city of Chicago was permitted to intervene as defend-
ant. The District Court, composed of three judges (U. S. C., title
28, sec. 380), granted an interlocutory injunction, and on final hear-
ing entered its decree, adjudging, upon findings, that the rates pre-
scribed by the State commission were confiscatory and permanently
restraining the enforcement of its order. The Illinois Commerce

MONDAY, OCTOBER 26, 1931
79
72
Commission and the Attorney General of the State have not
appealed from the decree, which is thus a final adjudication of the
invalidity of the rate order. The present appeal is taken by the city
of Chicago.
The Court is of the opinion that the city of Chicago has no separate
standing which entitles it to appeal from the decree, and its appeal
is dismissed. City of Pawhuska v. Pawhuska Oil & Gas Co., 250
U. S. 394; City of Chicago v. Dempcy, 250 U. S. 651; Denney v.
Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Co., 276 U. S. 97, 102; Railroad Com-

Company, 294 Ill. 413, 420-422. See also City of New York v. New
York Telephone Company, 261 U. S. 312, 316.
No. 120. Public Service Commission of Indiana et al., appellants,
v. Batesville Telephone Company. Appeal from the United States
Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Per curiam:
This suit was brought to restrain the enforcement of an order of the
Public Service Commission of Indiana upon the grounds that the
commission had exceeded its authority and that the order violated
the due process clause and the equal protection clause of the four-
teenth amendment of the Federal Constitution. The District Court
(a single judge sitting, as an interlocutory injunction was not sought,
Stratton v. St. Louis, S. W. Ry. Co., 282 U. S. 10, 15) dismissed the
bill for want of equity. The decree was reversed by the Circuit
Court of Appeals, which directed that the relief for which the bill
prayed be granted. The sole ground of the decision of the Circuit
Court of Appeals was that the Public Service Commission had no
jurisdiction under the law of the State to make the order.
The statute governing appeals to this Court from the Circuit
Courts of Appeals is section 240 of the Judicial Code as amended
by the act of February 13, 1925 (c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, 938), which
provides in paragraphs (b) and (c) as follows:
"(b) Any case in a Circuit Court of Appeals where is drawn in
question the validity of a statute of any State, on the ground of its
being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United
States, and the decision is against its validity, may, at the election of
the party relying on such State statute, be taken to the Supreme
Court for review on writ of error or appeal; but in that event a
review on certiorari shall not be allowed at the instance of such
party, and the review on such writ of error or appeal shall be re-
stricted to an examination and decision of the Federal questions
presented in the case.

MONDAY, OCTOBER 26, 1931
80
"(c) No judgment or decree of a Circuit Court of Appeals or of
the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia shall be subject
to review by the Supreme Court otherwise than as provided in this
section."
The plain intent of this statute is to limit appeals to this Court
from a Circuit Court of Appeals to cases where its decision is against
the validity of a statute of a State upon the ground of its being
repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States.
In other cases, review by this Court, if it be had, must be pursuant
to a writ of certiorari duly applied for and granted.
As in this case the Circuit Court of Appeals did not decide
against the validity of the order of the Pubile Service Commission
upon the asserted Federal grounds, but dealt with its validity solely
under the State law, the appeal must be dismissed.
No. 68. Samuel W. Baxter, as Administrator of the Estate of
George A. Zeller, deceased, appellant, v. Continental Casualty Com-
pany. Appeal from the United States Circuit Court of Appeals
for the Eighth Circuit. Per curiam: This action was originally
brought in the Circuit Court, city of St. Louis, Missouri, and was
removed to the District Court of the United States upon the ground
of diversity of citizenship. The action was upon a policy of auto-
mobile insurance issued by the defendant, and recovery depended
upon judgment having been obtained and execution thereon having
been returned unsatisfied in an action against the assured. It was
shown that action had been brought in the State court against the
assured, the Southwest Motor Sales Co., a Missouri corporation,
and also against one Harry Shields, its executive officer. Process
had been served upon Shields personally, and jurisdiction of the
Southwest Motor Sales Co. had been sought by constructive service
under the Missouri law. Judgment by default had been entered
against both defendants and execution had been returned unsatisfied.
In the present action the Circuit Court of Appeals, affirming judg-
ment for the defendant, held that the insurance policy which the
defendant had issued did not cover Shields and that the service in
the action against the Southwest Motor Sales Co. was invalid under
the decisions of the State court. Priest v. Capitain, 236 Mo. 436,
457; Moss v. Fitch, 212 Mo. 484, 497. As the decision of the Circuit
Court of Appeals merely applied the law of the State, no question is
presented which gives this Court jurisdiction of the appeal. Public
Service Commission of Indiana et al. v. Batesville Telephone Co.,
decided this day. Appeal dismissed.
The Chief Justice announced:

the Court made this day, upon motions submitted, upon examination

No. In re disbarment of William E. Baff. A rule having
been issued by this Court on March 25, 1931, directing William E.
Baff to show cause why he should not be disbarred from the practice
of the law in this Court upon the ground that he had been disbarred
in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District
of California; the rule together with the return and answer of the
said Baff thereto having been referred to a committee of the bar of
this Court to make report and recommendation respecting the final
action to be taken by this Court conformably to rule 2, paragraph 5,
of the rules of this Court; the said committee having reported that
the evidence does not warrant the conclusion that the disbarment
of the said Baff by the District Court of the United States for the
Southern District of California was disciplinary but rather because
his name had been entered upon the rolls of the court without a
proper showing of qualification; and the majority of said committee
having recommended that the rule to show cause heretofore issued
against the said Baff be discharged on the ground that no charges
had been made which would constitute a ground for his disbarment
by this Court under paragraph 5 of rule 2.

MONDAY, NOVEMBER 2, 1931

It is ordered that the rule to show cause issued against the said
Baff March 25, 1931, be, and the same hereby is discharged.
And it having been represented to the Court that the said Baff was
disbarred from the practice of the law in the United States Patent
Office on March 18, 1921, upon charges of misconduct; that his
application to be reregistered as a member of the Patent Office bar
was denied upon March 28, 1929, by the Commissioner of Patents;
that the action of the Commissioner of Patents in refusing recog-
nition to the said Baff as a patent attorney was sustained by the
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia on
February 19, 1931; and the Court being of the opinion that it
possesses inherent power to inquire into the conduct of members of
the bar of this Court and is not limited by paragraph 5 of rule 2 of
the rules of this Court.
It is further ordered that a rule issue, returnable on Monday,
November 30 next, to the said William E. Baff, ordering him to
show cause why he should not be disbarred from the practice of the

of the Court thereon as above mentioned.

Court.
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES,
Washington, D. C., January 12, 1932.
DEAR JUSTICE HOLMES: We can not permit your long association in
the work of the Court to end without expressing our keen sense of
loss and our warm affection. Your judicial service of over forty-nine
years-twenty years in the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts
and twenty-nine years upon this bench-has a unique distinction in
uninterrupted effectiveness and exceptional quality. Your profound
learning and philosophic outlook have found expression in opinions
which have become classic, enriching the literature of the law as
well as its substance. With a most conscientious exactness in the
performance of every duty, you have brought to our collaboration
in difficult tasks a personal charm and a freedom and independence
of spirit which have been a constant refreshment. While we are
losing the privilege of daily companionship, the most precious
memories of your unfailing kindliness and generous nature abide
with us, and these memories will ever be one of the choicest
traditions of the Court.
Deeply regretting the necessity for your retirement, we trust
that relieved of the burden which had become too heavy-you may

MY DEAR BRETHREN: You must let me call you so once more.
more than kind, your generous, letter touches me to the bottom of my
heart. The long and intimate association with men who so command
my respect and admiration could not but fix my affection as well.
For such little time as may be left for me I shall treasure it as
adding gold to the sunset.
Affectionately yours,
O. W. HOLMES.

February 13, 1925, 43 Stat. 936, 938), and certiorari is denied.
The Chief Justice said:

Per curiam: The appeal herein is dismissed for the want of a sub-

No. 818. Kerr Glass Manufacturing Corporation, appellant, v.
The Superior Court of the State of Washington for Kings County
and Wm. J. Steiner, One of the Judges thereof. Appeal from the

Power Co., 252 U. S. 341, 344; White River Company v. Arkansas,
279 U. S. 692, 700. Treating the papers whereon the appeal was
alowed as a petition for writ of certiorari (sec. 237 (c), Judicial
Code as amended, 43 Stat. 936, 938), certiorari is denied.
No. 952. Jacob Nachman, petitioner, v. The United States of
America. On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States
Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The motion for
leave to proceed further herein in forma pauperis is denied for the
reason that the Court, upon examination of the unprinted record
herein submitted, finds no ground upon which a writ of certiorari
should issue. The petition for writ of certiorari is therefore also
denied.
The Chief Justice said:
"The other orders of the Court appear upon the list certified by
the Chief Justice and filed with the clerk and will not be announced
orally."
No., original. Ex parte: The United States of America, peti-
tioner. The motion for leave to file petition for writ of mandamus

MONDAY, MAY 23, 1932

No., original. Ex parte: Krentler-Arnold Hinge Last Company,
petitioner. Motion for leave to file petition for writ of man-
damus. The decree of this Court in Leman v. Krentler-Arnold
Hinge Last Company, 284 U. S. 448, reversed the final decree of the
United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in this
cause only in so far as it related to the allowance of profits. The
decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals modifying that of the Dis-
trict Court in matters other than in relation to the allowance of
profits remains unaffected by the decree or mandate of this Court.
In this view it remains for the District Court, in its decree upon the
mandate of this Court, to carry into effect so much of the decree of
the Circuit Court of Appeals as is unaffected by the decree and
mandate of this Court. The Circuit Court of Appeals has full
authority, upon appropriate application to it, to secure enforcement
of its decree to the extent that it was affirmed by this Court. In
view of the existence of that remedy, the motion for leave to file
petition for writ of mandamus in this Court is denied without
prejudice.
-

recommendation of the committee of the bar of this Court, appointed

issued, November 2, 1931, against William E. Baff to show cause why

United States Patent Office which resulted in his disbarment, March
18, 1921, from the practice of the law before the Patent Office and
the denial of his application to be reregistered, March 28, 1929, as a
member of the Patent Office bar; and the said Baff, in response to
that rule, having filed an answer, January 29, 1932, challenging the
regularity and validity of the proceedings in connection with his
disbarment in the United States Patent Office and the denial of his
application for reregistration; and this Court, in view of this chal-
lenge, being desirous to be advised of the state of the record of the
proceedings in the Patent Office, having appointed, by order of Feb-
ruary 15, 1932, a committee of the bar of this Court to examine and
report upon specific inquiries as to the state of the record of the
Patent Office in relation to said disbarment and subsequent pro-
ceedings, as set forth in said order, and to submit its recommendation

ORDER
It is ordered that the rules of this Court be, and they are hereby,
amended as follows, effective September 1, 1932, viz:
RULE 2, PARAGRAPH 5
Where it is shown to the court that any member of its bar has
been disbarred from practice in any State, Territory, District, or
insular possession, or has been guilty of conduct unbecoming a
member of the bar of this court, he will be forthwith suspended
from practice before this court, and unless, upon notice mailed to
him at the address shown in the clerk's records and to the clerk of
the highest court of the State, Territory, District, or insular posses-
sion to which he belongs, he shows good cause to the contrary within
40 days he will be disbarred.
RULE 7, PARAGRAPH 3
No motion by respondent to dismiss a petition for writ of
certiorari will be received. Objections to the jurisdiction of the
court to grant writs of certiorari may be included in briefs in
opposition to petitions therefor.
A motion by appellee to dismiss an appeal will be received in
advance of the court's ruling upon the jurisdictional statements only
when presented in the manner provided by rule 12, paragraph 3.
When such a motion is made, the appellant shall have 20 days after
service upon him within which to file in this court 40 printed copies
of a brief opposing the motion, except that where his counsel resides
in California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Idaho, Utah, Arizona,
New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, or an outlying
possession, the time shall be 25 days.

TUESDAY, MAY 31, 1932
344
A motion by respondent to dismiss a writ of certiorari or by
appellee to dismiss an appeal, after the court has ruled upon the
jurisdictional statements and accompanying motions, if any (rule
12, paragraph 5), will be received if not based upon grounds already
advanced in opposition to the granting of the writ of certiorari or to
the noting of jurisdiction of the appeal. Such motions, together
with motions to dismiss certificates in case of questions certified, must
be printed and 40 copies thereof must be filed with the clerk, accom-
panied by proof that a copy of the motion, and accompanying brief,
if any, have been served upon counsel of record for the opposing
party. The opposing party shall have 20 days from the date of
such service within which to file a printed brief opposing the motion.
When counsel for the opposing party resides in California, Oregon,
Washington, Nevada, Idaho, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado,
Wyoming, Montana, or an outlying possession, the time shall be 25
days. Upon the filing of the opposing brief, or the expiration of
the time allowed therefor, or express waiver of the right to file,
the motion and briefs thereon shall be distributed by the clerk to the
court for its consideration.
The pendency of a motion to dismiss or affirm shall not preclude
the placing of the cause upon the calendar of the court for oral
argument or its being called for argument when reached.
RULE 10, PARAGRAPH 1
When an appeal is allowed a citation to the appellee shall be
signed by the judge or justice allowing the appeal and shall be
made returnable not exceeding 40 days from the day of signing
the citation, whether the return day fall in vacation or in term
time, except in appeals from California, Oregon, Washington,
Nevada, Idaho, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming,
and Montana, when the time shall be 60 days. The citation must
be served before the return day.
RULE 10, PARAGRAPH 2
The clerk of the court from which an appeal to this court may
be allowed, shall make and transmit to this court under his hand
and the seal of the court a true copy of the material parts of the
record, always including the assignment of errors, and any opinions
delivered in the case.
To enable the clerk to perform such duty and for the purpose of
reducing the size of transcripts and eliminating all papers not
necessary to the consideration of the questions to be reviewed, it
shall be the duty of the appellant, or his counsel, to file with the

TUESDAY, MAY 31, 1932
345
clerk of the lower court, together with proof or acknowledgment
of service of a copy on the appellee, or his counsel, a praecipe indi-
cating the portions of the record to be incorporated into the tran-
script. Should the appellee, or his counsel, desire additional por-
tions of the record incorporated into the transcript he or his
counsel shall file with the clerk of the lower court his praecipe,
within ten days thereafter (unless the time be enlarged by a judge
of the lower court or a justice of this court), indicating the addi-
tional portions of the record desired to be included. See Equity
Rules, 75-77, 226 U. S., Appendix, p. 23, and 286 U. S. —.
The clerk of the lower court shall transmit to this court as the
transcript of the record only the portions of the record covered by
such designations.
The parties or their counsel may by written stipulation filed with
the clerk of the lower court indicate the portions of the record to
be included in the transcript, and the clerk shall then transmit only
the parts designated in such stipulation.
In all cases the clerk shall include in the transcript all papers
filed under authority of rule 12. See Rule 12, paragraph 4.
If this court shall find that any portion of the record unnecessary
to a proper presentation of the case has been incorporated into the
transcript at the instance of either party, the whole or any part of
the cost of printing and the clerk's fee for supervising the printing
may be ordered to be paid by the offending party.
RULE 12
Jurisdiction of this Court to review upon appeal
1. Upon the presentation of a petition for the allowance of an ap-
peal to this court, from any court, to any judge or justice empowered
by law to allow it, there shall be presented by the applicant a separate
typewritten statement particularly disclosing the basis upon which it
is contended that this court has jurisdiction upon appeal to review
the judgment or decree in question. The statement shall refer dis-
tinctly (a) to the statutory provision believed to sustain the juris-
diction, (b) to the statute of the state, or statute or treaty of the
United States, the validity of which is involved (giving the volume
and page where the statute or treaty may be found in the official
edition), setting it out verbatim or appropriately summarizing
its pertinent provisions; and (c) to the date of judgment or decree
sought to be reviewed and the date upon which the application for
appeal is presented. The statement shall show that the nature of
the case and of the rulings of the court was such as to bring the

TUESDAY, MAY 31, 1932
346
case within the jurisdictional provision relied on, and shall cite
the cases believed to sustain the jurisdiction.
If the appeal is from an interlocutory decree of a specially consti-
tuted District Court of the United States (Judicial Code, sec. 266;
U. S. C., tit. 28, sec. 380), the statement must also include a showing
of the matters in which it is claimed that the court has abused its
discretion in granting or denying the interlocutory injunction.
(Alabama v. United States, 279 U. S. 229.)
2. If the appeal is allowed, the appellant shall serve upon the
appellee within five days after such allowance (a) a copy of the peti-
tion for and order allowing the appeal, together with a copy of the
assignments of error and of the statement required by paragraph 1
of this rule, and (b) a statement directing attention to the pro-
visions of paragraph 3 of this rule. Proof of service of the papers
required by this paragraph to be served shall be filed forthwith with
the clerk of the court possessed of the record, and shall be incor-
porated by him in the transcript of record prepared for this court
upon the appeal.
3. Within 15 days after such service the appellee may file with the
clerk of the court possessed of the record, and serve upon the ap-
pellant, a typewritten statement disclosing any matter or ground
making against the jurisdiction of this court asserted by the ap-
pellant. There may be included in, or filed with, such opposing
statement, a motion by appellee to dismiss or affirm. Where such a
motion is made, it may be opposed as provided in rule 7, para-
graph 3.
4. The clerk of the court possessed of the record shall include the
statements and motions, required and permitted to be filed under
the provisions of this rule, in the transcript of record prepared for
the use of this court on the appeal, anything in the præcipes or
stipulations of the parties (rule 10, paragraph 2) to the contrary
notwithstanding.
5. After the case shall have been docketed in this court by the
appellant, and the transcript of record filed (rule 11, paragraph 1),
the clerk of this court shall forthwith print the appellant's state-
ment required by paragraph 1 of this rule and the opposing state-
ment, and motions, if any, permitted by paragraph 3 of this rule, and
the clerk shall thereupon distribute such printed papers to the court
for its consideration.
At the time of docketing the case the appellant shall make such
cash deposit with the clerk, in addition to such deposit as may be
required under rule 13, paragraph 1, as shall be necessary to defray
the cost of printing 40 copies of his statement filed pursuant to para-
graph 1 of this rule; and the appellee, upon demand, shall forthwith

TUESDAY, MAY 31, 1932
347
deposit with the clerk a sum sufficient to cover the cost of printing
40 copies of any statement or motions filed under paragraph 3 of
this rule.
6. If either appellant or appellee fails to comply with the provi-
sions of this rule, the clerk of this court shall report such failure
to the court immediately so that this court may take such action as
it deems proper.
RULE 13, PARAGRAPH 2
Immediately after the designation of the parts of the record to be
printed or the expiration of the time allotted therefor (see para-
graph 9 of this rule), the clerk shall make an estimate of the cost of
printing the record, his fee for preparing it for the printer and
supervising the printing, and other probable fees, and shall furnish
the same to the party docketing the case. If such estimated sum be
not paid on or before a date designated by the clerk of this court
in each case, it shall be the duty of the clerk to report that fact to
the court, whereupon the cause will be dismissed, unless good cause
to the contrary is shown.
RULE 13, PARAGRAPH 9
When the record is filed, or within five days thereafter, the ap-
pellant shall file with the clerk a definite statement of the points on
which he intends to rely and of the parts of the record which he
thinks necessary for the consideration thereof, with proof of service
of the same on the adverse party. The adverse party, within 10
days after service of the statement and designation required to be
filed by appellant may designate in writing, filed with the clerk,
additional parts of the record which he thinks material; and, if he
shall not do so, he shall be held to have consented to a hearing on the
parts designated by the appellant. The parts of the records so
designated by one or both of the parties, and only those parts, shall
be printed by the clerk. The statement of points intended to be
relied upon and the designations of the parts of the record to be
printed shall be printed by the clerk with the record. He shall,
however, omit all duplication, all repetition of titles, and all other
obviously unimportant matter, and make proper note thereof. The
court will consider nothing but the points of law so stated and the
parts of the record so designated. If at the hearing it shall appear
that any material part of the record has not been printed, the appeal
may be dismissed or such other order made as the circumstances may
appear to the court to require. If either party shall have caused
unnecessary parts of the record to be printed, such order as to costs
may be made as the court shall think proper.

TUESDAY, MAY 31, 1932
348
The fees of the clerk under rule 32, paragraph 6, shall be com-
puted on the folios in the record as filed, and shall be in full for the
performance of his duties in that regard.
RULE 38, PARAGRAPH 2
The petition shall contain only a summary and short statement of
the matter involved and the reasons relied on for the allowance of
the writ. A supporting brief may be included in the petition, but,
whether so included or presented separately, it must be direct, con-
cise, and in conformity with rules 26 and 27. A failure to comply
with these requirements will be a sufficient reason for denying the
petition. See United States v. Rimer, 220 U. S. 547; Furness,
Withy & Co. v. Yang Tze Insurance Assn., 242 U. S. 430; Houston
Oil Co. v. Goodrich, 245 U. S. 440; Layne & Bowler Corporaion v.
Western Well Works, 261 U. S. 387, 392; Magnum Import Co. v.
Coty, 262 U. S. 159, 163; Southern Power Co. v. North Carolina
Public Service Co., 263 U. S. 508. Forty printed copies of the peti-
tion and supporting brief shall be filed. The petition will be
deemed in time when it, the record, and the supporting brief, are
filed with the clerk within the period prescribed by section 8 of the
act of February 13, 1925.
RULE 38, PARAGRAPH 3 (A)
If the date for filing a brief in opposition falls in the summer
recess, the brief may be filed within 40 days after the service of
the notice, but this enlargement shall not extend the time to a later
date than September 10.
RULE 38, PARAGRAPH 4
Upon the expiration of the period for filing the respondent's brief,
or upon an express waiver of the right to file or the actual filing of
such brief in a shorter time, the petition, record, and briefs shall be
distributed by the clerk to the court for its consideration.
RULE 41, PARAGRAPH 4
A petition to this court for a writ of certiorari to review a judg-
ment of the Court of Claims shall be accompanied by a certified
transcript of the record in that court, consisting of the pleadings,
findings of fact, judgment and opinion of the court, but not the evi-
dence. The petition shall contain only a summary and short state-
ment of the matter involved and the reasons relied on for the allow-
ance of the writ, but may be accompanied by a brief to conform

TUESDAY, MAY 31, 1932
349
to rules 26 and 27 as to form. The petition, brief, and record shall
be filed wih the clerk and 40 copies shall be printed under his super-
vision. The record shall be printed in the same way and upon the
same terms that records on appeal are required to be printed. The
estimated costs of printing shall be paid within five days after the
estimate is furnished by the clerk and if payment is not so made the
petition may be summarily dismissed. When the petition, brief, and
record are printed the petitioner shall forthwith serve copies thereof
on the respondent, or his counsel of record, and shall file with the
clerk due proof thereof.
RULE 41, PARAGRAPH 5
Within 20 days after the petition, brief, and record are served the
respondent may file with the clerk 40 printed copies of an oppos-
ing brief, conforming to rules 26 and 27. Upon the expiration of
that period, or upon an express waiver of the right to file or
the actual filing of such brief in a shorter time, the petition, briefs,
and record shall be distributed by the clerk to the court for its
consideration.
The provision of subdivision (a) of paragraph 3 of rule 38 shall
apply to briefs in opposition to petitions for writs of certiorari to
review judgments of the Court of Claims.
RULE 46, PARAGRAFH 2
Under the act of January 31, 1928, as amended by the act of April
26, 1928, the review which theretofore could be had in this court on
writ of error may now be obtained on an appeal. But the appeal
thereby substituted for a writ of error must be sought, allowed, and
perfected in conformity with the statutes theretofore providing for a
writ of error. The appeal can be allowed only on the presentation
of a petition showing that the case is one in which, under the legis-
lation in force when the act of January 31, 1928, was passed, a re-
view could be had in this court on writ of error. The petition must
be accompanied by an assignment of errors (see rule 9), and state-
ment as to jurisdiction (see rule 12), and the judge or justice allow-
ing the appeal must take proper security for costs and sign the
requisite citation to the appellee. See paragraph 1 of rule 10 and
paragraph 1 of rule 36. The citation must be served on the appellee
or his counsel and filed, with proof of service, with the clerk of
the court in which the judgment to be reviewed was entered. The
mode of obtaining a supersedeas is pointed out in paragraph 2 of
rule 36.

questions presented by the appeal being omitted and the testimony
of witnesses being stated only in narrative form, save that if either
party desires it, and the court or judge so directs, any part of the
testimony shall be reproduced in the exact words of the witness.
The duty of so condensing and stating the evidence shall rest pri-
marily on the appellant, who shall prepare his statement thereof
and lodge the same in the clerk's office for the examination of the
other parties at or before the time of filing his praecipe under para-
graph (a) of this rule. He shall also notify the other parties or
their solicitors of such lodgment and shall name a time and place
when he will ask the court or judge to approve the statement, the
time so named to be at least ten days after such notice. At the
expiration of the time named or such further time as the court or
judge may allow, the statement, together with any objections made
or amendments proposed by any party, shall be presented to the
court or the judge, and if the statement be true, complete and prop-
erly prepared, it shall be approved by the court or judge, and if it
be not true, complete, or properly prepared, it shall be made so
under the direction of the court or judge and shall then be approved.
When approved, it shall be filed in the clerk's office and become a
part of the record for the purposes of the appeal."
