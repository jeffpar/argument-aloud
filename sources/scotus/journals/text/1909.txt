asked that sentence be pronounced. These defendants were then

ment of the court as follows:
"You, Joseph F. Shipp, Jeremiah Gibson, Luther Williams, Nick
Nolan, Henry Padgett and William Mayse, are before this court on
an attachment for contempt.
"On return to a rule to show cause you have presented such evi-
dence as you were advised and been fully heard orally and on printed
briefs, and after thorough consideration you have been found guilty.
You have also been permitted severally to present petitions for rehear-
ing and move that leave be granted to file them, which after consider-
ation have been denied.
"The grounds upon which the conclusion was reached are set forth in
the opinion filed herein on Monday, May 24, 1909, and need not be re-
peated, nor need we dwell upon the destructive consequences of per-
mitting the transaction complained of to pass into a precedent for
unpunished contempt.
"It is considered by the court, and the judgment of the court is,
that as punishment for the contempt you, Joseph F. Shipp, Luther
Williams and Nick Nolan, and each of you, be imprisoned for the
period of ninety days, and that you, Jeremiah Gibson, Henry Padgett
and William Mayse, and each of you, be imprisoned for the period of
sixty days, in the jail of the District of Columbia. The marshal of
this court is charged with the execution of this judgment."

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES.
MONDAY, JANUARY 10, 1910.
Present: The Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Harlan, Mr. Justice
Brewer, Mr. Justice White, Mr. Justice McKenna, Mr. Justice
Holmes, Mr. Justice Day and Mr. Justice Lurton.
Mr. Attorney-General Wickersham addressed the court as follows:
May it please the court, I am requested by the members of the
bar of this court to present for entry upon your records the resolu-
tions recently adopted expressing their profound sorrow in the death
of Mr. Justice Peckham and their sincere tribute to his high charac-
ter and eminent service to the country. These resolutions are as
follows:
"Resolved, That the bar of the Supreme Court of the United
States deeply deplore the death of Rufus W. Peckham, associate
justice of the Supreme Court, and desire to place upon record an ex-
pression of the respect and esteem in which Justice Peckham was
held and of regret for the loss which the court, the bar and the
country have suffered in his untimely death.
66
For twenty-four years he was an able and successful advocate at
the bar of his native State of New York. For twelve years, by the
election of his people, he was a member of the highest court of
original jurisdiction and of the court of last resort of that State.
For fourteen years he sat upon the bench of the Supreme Court of
the United States. For a full half century he served the cause of
justice without fear and without reproach. His learning and strong
powers of reasoning preserved the standards of the law. His knowl-
edge of affairs and the breadth and vigor of his sympathies with the
life and men of his time saved his judgments from pedantry and
made them effective instruments for the application of the old prin-
ciples to new conditions. His published opinions constitute a sub-
stantial and valuable contribution to the development of American
law. The virile and courageous independence of his strong char-
acter, its integrity and its purity, created and justified universal
confidence in his judicial acts. The influence of his life and the
effect of his work have contributed powerfully to promote that re-
spect for law and for the courts of our country which underlies all
of our institutions.
"Resolved, That the Attorney-General be asked to present these
resolutions to the court, with the request that they be entered upon
21309-10-44

82
the records, and that the chairman of this meeting be directed to
send to the family of the late Mr. Justice Peckham a copy of the
resolutions and an expression of our sympathy for them in the loss
which they have sustained."
These resolutions of the bar are intended, in some measure, to ex-
press not alone the sense of personal bereavement which is so deeply
felt by the immediate friends and associates of Mr. Justice Peckham,
but a just and fitting estimate of his life and labors as they are
known and esteemed by his countrymen.
The extent of the contribution to the work of this court of a single
member is as difficult of exact ascertainment as is his influence upon
its judgments. Only as he speaks through the published opinions
which he is directed to announce can the bar or the people know the
extent or the character of his service. His devotion to the duties of
his high place, his persuasive insistence upon the right as it is given
him to see it, his painstaking industry, his aid in council, his per-
sonal characteristics-all these are attributes which intimate friends
may know, and which may be revealed now and again in the con-
vincing earnestness of some striking opinion, but which have their
full, free play only among his colleagues on the bench.
Looking back with this light upon the services of Rufus Wheeler
Peckham, it is not beyond the truth to say that in the period of his
service on the bench no man contributed more than he to the learning
and development of the law.
He came of a family of lawyers and judges. His father, his
brother, his sons made this profession the work of their lives.
Though the span of his own life was little beyond seventy years, more
than half of it was devoted to the public administration of the law
of his State or his country. Though the period of his service in this
court was less than fifteen years, it is perhaps not too much to say
that in no other period of our history has the jurisprudence of the
country been more profoundly affected by the new conditions and
the new problems that have arisen as incident to our national growth
and development. It has been largely during these fifteen years
that the graver questions involved in the effort of the National Gov-
ernment to cope with the great industrial problems arising out of
our unexampled commercial expansion have found their way to this
court. It has been wholly within these fifteen years that our relations.
with foreign possessions and the interpretation of our laws for the
government of alien peoples have been here debated and' determined.
In this work Mr. Justice Peckham did his full share. No one can
examine, even cursorily, the deliverances of this court during the last
decade and a half without being impressed by the tremendous volume
of it which came from his hand and brain. In that time he wrote
nearly four hundred opinions. They dealt with every aspect of the
law. But more striking than the number is the fact that so many of
them are to-day, and will ever remain, the leading and familiar cases
upon the great questions with which they dealt. No tribute to the
life and work of Mr. Justice Peckham could find a higher sanction

83
than the mere citation of his opinions in such cases as Maxwell v.
Dow, Hopkins v. United States, the Addyston Pipe case, the Trans-
Missouri and the Joint Traffic Association cases, Montague v. Lowry,
Lochner v. New York, Ex parte Young, which reveal his great
learning and industry.
But we can not garner up his work as men would bind the har-
vest of a season. It has enriched the whole field of our national juris-
prudence, and for all time the yield will be the better for his labor.
If it please the court, I have the honor to move that the resolutions
adopted by the bar be entered at large upon the records of this
court.
The Chief Justice responded:
The resolutions and the remarks by which they are accompanied
will be spread upon our records as deserved tributes to the memory
of the brother who has so recently been taken from us. Whatsoever
things are true and honest, just and of good report, these are the
things which the record of the life of Mr. Justice Peckham displays.
Its most striking characteristic is the single mindedness of his devo-
tion to judicial duty. It may be said of him as it was of Mr. Justice
Story that "in all his commerce with the world and in his inter-
course with the circle of his friends the predominance of his judicial
character was manifest." He discharged his judicial duties not as
upon compulsion, but because he loved them. It ran in his blood,
and he profoundly believed that justice was "the great interest of
man on earth.”
"As a man thinketh, so is he," and as this man was, so was his
style, simple, forcible, and direct. He aimed to do substantial jus-
tice in an intelligible way, dealing in no strained inferences, nor
muddling definite results by qualifying his qualifications.
His opinions from the first in volume 160 of our reports to the last
in volume 214 are all lucid expositions of the matter in hand, and
many of them of peculiar gravity and importance in the establish-
ment of governing principles. He sought to avoid the curse de-
nounced on the removal of landmarks while meriting the blessing
accorded to their wise reenforcement. His death is a serious loss to
the cause of jurisprudence, to this court, and to his country. I can
not trust myself to speak of the loss to his brethren of this lovable
and beloved comrade. We can not but be exceeding sorrowful as we
recall the touch of the vanished hand and the sound of the voice that
is still. "Let us alone," sang the Lotus-Eaters, "what is it that will
last?" We find the answer in the example of this distinguished,
faithful, and thorough life which, "though the whole world turns to
coal, then chiefly lives."
Mr. Elihu Root presented to the court the resolutions adopted at a
meeting of the members of the bar of the State of New York in
memory of Mr. Justice Peckham, and it was ordered that they be
placed on file.

ing and wisdom displayed, the consecration and fidelity ever and
always evidenced. will be found his only fitting eulogy. His remark-
able grasp of the underlying principles upon which our whole struc-
ture of government rests, his unswerving fidelity to the fixed rules
of order and stability so essential and so often sorely tested, his
strong, positive, upright, fearless character, his power of sustained
intellectual effort, place him easily among the great judges of his
day and time. No one ever doubted his purity of life, his integrity
of purpose, and all who read and consider his legal opinions pay
homage to his profound intellect. Those who knew him are quick to
testify to his tender and considerate nature,,and those who must be
content to find his character in his opinions scattered through many
state, circuit. and Supreme Court decisions will never doubt his
probity or his power as a jurist.
"Resolved, That the Attorney-General be asked to present these
resolutions to the court with the request that they be entered upon
the records and that the chairman of this meeting be directed to send
to the family of the late Justice Brewer a copy of the resolutions and
an expression of our sympathy for them in the loss which they have
sustained."
Justice Brewer's period of service in this court covered twenty
years. These two decades brought before this court some of the
most important and far-reaching questions which have ever been
submitted for its decision, and in the solution of these great prob-
lems Justice Brewer took a leading part. In the reports of this
period there are to be found 719 opinions written by Justice Brewer,
in 157 of which he dissented from the conclusions of the majority
of the court. The limits of this occasion will permit only a brief
reference to a few decisions which illustrate the characteristics of
his mind and the lucidity of his exposition.
One of the earliest of his recorded opinions was that in the case
of the Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States (143 U. S., 457),
where the court was called upon to decide whether or not the act
prohibiting the importation of foreigners and aliens under con-
tract to perform labor in the United States applied to an English
Christian minister who had come to the United States pursuant to
an agreement with a Protestant Episcopal Church in the city of
New York. The opinion is of especial interest, not merely as a fine
discriminating construction of the statute and the application of the
principle that laws must receive a sensible construction, and that
where a literal construction leads to an absurd conclusion the letter
of the law must give way to the presumed intention of the legisla-
ture, but because of the enunciation of the principle that "no pur-
pose of action against religion can be imputed to any legislation,

66
196
state or national, because this is a religious people." "If we exam-
ine the constitutions of the various States," said the learned justice,
we find in them a constant recognition of religious obligations.
Every constitution of every one of the forty-four States contains
language which either directly or by clear implication recognizes a
profound reverence for religion and an assumption that its influence
in all human affairs is essential to the well-being of the community."

"There is no dissonance in these declarations. There is a universal
language pervading them all, having one meaning; they affirm and
reaffirm that this is a religious nation. These are not individual
sayings, declarations of private persons; they are organic utterances;
they speak the voice of the entire people."
*
*
*

"In the face of all these, shall it be believed that a Congress of the
United States intended to make it a misdemeanor for a church of
this country to contract for the services of a Christian minister re-
siding in another nation?"
In the case of Kansas v. Colorado (206 U. S., 46), perhaps one of
the most important decisions in which Mr. Justice Brewer wrote the
opinion of the court, he was called upon to deal with riparian rights
and to determine whether or not one State has the right to the con-
tinuous flow of the waters of a river flowing to it through an ad-
joining State, or whether the latter State has the right to so appro-
priate its waters as to prevent such continuous flow; and whether
the amount of the flow is subject to the superior authority and super-
visory control of the United States.
In considering at the outset the foundations of the jurisdiction of
this court over controversies between States, Justice Brewer laid down
the proposition that the judicial power of a nation extends to all
controversies justiciable in their nature, the parties to which or the
property involved in which may be reached by judicial process, and
when the judicial power of the United States was vested in the Su-
preme and other courts all the judicial power which the nation was
capable of exercising was vested in those tribunals, and unless there
be some limitations expressed in the Constitution it must be held to
embrace all controversies of a justiciable nature arising within the
territorial limits of the nation, no matter who may be the parties
thereto. "These considerations," he said, "lead to the propositions
that when a legislative power is claimed for the National Govern-
ment the question is whether that power is one of those granted by
the Constitution, either in terms or by necessary implication, whereas
in respect to judicial functions the question is whether there be any
limitations expressed in the Constitution on the general grant of
national power."
One of the ablest opinions of Mr. Justice Brewer is that in the case
of In re Debs, petitioner (158 U. S., 564), in which he expressed the
unanimous views of the court in affirming that the relations of the

197
General Government to interstate commerce and the transportation
of the mails are such as to authorize a direct interference to prevent
an obstruction thereto, and that a court of equity has jurisdiction to
issue an injunction in aid of the performance of such duty.
Perhaps in no other opinion of this court is there a better sum-
mary. of the principles upon which rest the power of the Federal
Government to maintain its sovereignty than those with which
Justice Brewer concludes his opinion in this case:
66* * *' We hold that the Government of the United States is
one having jurisdiction over every foot of soil within its territory,
and acting directly upon each citizen; that while it is a government
of enumerated powers, it has within the limits of those powers all the
attributes of sovereignty; that to it is committed power over inter-
state commerce and the transmission of the mail; that the powers
thus conferred upon the National Government are not dormant, but
have been assumed and put into practical exercise by the legislation
of Congress; that in the exercise of those powers it is competent for
the nation to remove all obstructions upon highways, natural or arti-
ficial, to the passage of interstate commerce or the carrying of the
mail; that while it may be competent for the Government (through
the executive branch and in the use of the entire executive power of
the nation) to forcibly remove all such obstructions, it is equally
within its competency to appeal to the civil courts for an inquiry and
determination as to the existence and character of any alleged ob-
structions, and if such are found to exist or threaten to occur, to
invoke the powers of those courts to remove or restrain such obstruc-
tions; that the jurisdiction of courts to interfere in such matters by
injunction is one recognized from ancient times and by indubitable
authority."
Justice Brewer was always noted as a man of deep religious con-
viction. We have seen that one of the first questions which he was
called upon to deal with after his elevation to the Supreme Court
involved the relation between religion and the National Government.
He was keenly interested in the position of woman in our modern
society, and one of the latest of his decisions (Muller v. State of
Oregon, 208 U. S., 412) involved the right of a State to regulate the
working hours of women. After reviewing the laws of Oregon, he
observed:
"It thus appears that, putting to one side the elective franchise,
in the matter of personal and contractual rights they stand on the
same plane as the other sex. Their rights in these respects can no
more be infringed than the equal rights of their brothers."
Yet he held, and in so doing voiced the unanimous opinion of this
court-
66
That woman's physical structure and the performance of mater-
nal functions place her at a disadvantage in the struggle for sub-
sistence is obvious. This is especially true when the burdens of
motherhood are upon her. Even when they are not, by abundant
testimony of the medical fraternity, continuance for a long time

198
on her feet at work, repeating this from day to day, tends to inju-
rious effects upon the body, and as healthy mothers are essential to
vigorous offspring the physical well-being of woman becomes an
object of public interest and care in order to preserve the strength
and vigor of the race.
66
* * *
Still, again, history discloses the fact that woman has always
been dependent upon man. He established his control at the outset.
by superior physical strength, and this control in various forms,
with diminishing intensity, has continued to the present.
Education was long denied her, and while now the doors of the
schoolroom are opened and her opportunities for acquiring knowl-
edge are great, yet even with that and the consequent increase of
capacity for business affairs it is still true that in the struggle for
subsistence she is not an equal competitor with her brother. Though
limitations upon personal and contractual rights may be removed by
legislation, there is that in her disposition and habits of life which
will operate against a full assertion of those rights. She will still
be where some legislation to protect her seems necessary to secure
a real equality of right."
Your honors know better than any but his immediate family the
personal qualities which endeared Justice Brewer alike to his asso-
ciates on the bench, to his friends, and to the bar.
Nothing better can be said of any man, however high his place or
great his deeds, than that throughout his life he was not only es-
teemed, but beloved of all who knew him, and, indeed, that praise
is greater in proportion as exalted station and high career tend to
isolate from one's fellows. Justice Brewer everywhere and always
won affection. It was so in his life at the university. His activities
as a judge of his adopted State, Kansas, and then as judge of the
United States for the largest circuit in the country, were made
easier and more effective by the warm and lasting regard of his
bar; and when advancement to this court widened his contact from
the lawyers of the West to the lawyers and, indeed, to the people
of the nation, he soon gained the love of his countrymen generally,
and it remained with him to the end. Reasons need not be sought.
They would not be difficult to find or to declare, but such continued
and ever extending hold upon the hearts of men proves, without
analysis, the worth and beauty of the personality that gains it.
Justice Brewer was a son of a Christian missionary, and the son's
life, like the father's, was one of service. For six and forty years he
served the people, hearing causes and judging "righteously between
every man and his brother and the stranger that is with him." And
in the discharge of his great office he did ever obey the injunction laid
upon the judges of Israel by their great lawgiver:
"Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the
small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man,
for the judgment is God's." (a. 1 Deut., 17.)

199
The Chief Justice responded as follows:
During the years of my occupancy of a seat upon this bench it has
been my sad duty to accept for the court tributes of the bar in mem-
ory of the many members of this tribunal who have passed to their
reward. As our brother Brewer joins the great procession, there pass
before me the forms of Matthews and Miller, of Field and Bradley
and Lamar and Blatchford, of Jackson and Gray and of Peckham,
whose works follow them now that they rest from their labors. They
were all men of marked ability, of untiring industry, and of intense
devotion to duty, but they were not alike. They differed "as one
star differs from another star in glory." Their names will remain
illustrious in the annals of jurisprudence. And now we are called
on to deplore the departure of one of the most lovable of them all.
He died suddenly, but not the unprepared death from which we
pray to be delivered. When the unexpected intelligence was con-
veyed to me I could not but think of Mrs. Barbauld's poem on "Life,"
and seemed to hear our dear friend exclaim-
"Life! we've been long together,
Through pleasant and through cloudy weather;
"Tis hard to part when friends are dear;
Perhaps 'twill cost a sigh, a tear;
Then steal away, give little warning,
Choose thine own time;
Say not good night, but in some brighter clime
Bid me good morning."
The resolutions of our bar and the discriminating remarks of the
Attorney-General adequately cover the magnificent judicial labors
of Mr. Justice Brewer, but it is the ineffable sweetness of his disposi-
tion that chiefly impresses itself upon me and is indicated by the
serenity of the verse I have quoted.
He was a truly eloquent man. The fountain of tears and the foun-
tain of laughter ran close together and carried the hearer away upon
the mingled current of their waters. And like Mr. Lincoln, he evi-
dently found great comfort from the inevitable trials and tribulations
of the world in the humorous anecdotes which brought the relief of
merriment.
But I can not prolong these remarks. The resolutions and ob-
servations of the Attorney-General will be spread upon our records.
