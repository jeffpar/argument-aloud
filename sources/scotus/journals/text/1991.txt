The Chief Justice said:
"Before calling the first case for argument this morning, it is appro-
priate for us to note that today, for the first time in twenty-four years,
a Term of the Court commences without our colleague Justice Thurgood
Marshall sitting beside us on the bench. Following his retirement this
summer his colleagues on the Court joined in sending him a letter which
reads as follows:
September 12, 1991
Dear Thurgood,
Your decision to retire from the Court brings a sense of sorrow to all
of us. For twenty-four years you have been a colleague, and for twenty-
four years you have had an important voice in the shaping of the deci-

118
MONDAY, OCTOBER 7. 1991
sional law of this Court. We will miss your counsel in our future delib-
erations, and will likewise miss the innumerable "tall tales" with which
you delighted us.
Everyone who sits on the Supreme Court will be remembered in the
history of American constitutional law, but you are unique in having
made major contributions to that law before becoming a member of the
Court. Your role in the battle for equal treatment of the races would
entitle you to a prominent place in that history had you never ascended
the bench at all. You leave behind you landmarks from your career as a
lawyer, as well as from your career as a judge.
We bid you farewell from our common labors, but look forward to your
continued society off the bench. We trust that retirement at this time
will help you regain the good health which is our wish for you.
Affectionately,
William H. Rehnquist
Byron R. White
Harry A. Blackmun
John Paul Stevens
Sandra O'Connor
Antonin Scalia
Anthony M. Kennedy
David H. Souter."
Justice Marshall said:
"Dear Colleagues,
Thank you for your gracious letter. As I read it, I was reminded of the
wonderful times we have spent together both personally and profes-
sionally over the years. It has been a great honor for me to serve on
the Court, and I am saddened that I must now give up the daily fare-
the oral arguments, the Conference discussions, the opinions and dis-
sents that has provided me such enormous intellectual and emotional
satisfaction for 24 years.
More than that, though, I am saddened that I will no longer have the
opportunity to enjoy regular contact and communications with all of
you. Your warmth and collegiality have been of great encouragement
to me; I will miss that - and all of you-deeply.

MONDAY, OCTOBER 7. 1991
119
Although I will not take part in the work ahead, I am hopeful the
Court will meet the upcoming challenges, and I am grateful for the time
we have spent together. Because of the bonds we have formed, I rest
assured that though my active service on the Court ends, our ties of
friendship hold fast.
Affectionately,
Thurgood."

Buffalo, NY

"On Thursday, October 17th, Natalie Cornell Rehnquist, the wife of
Chief Justice William Rehnquist, died of cancer at the National Insti-
tutes of Health.
Nan, as she was known, was determined to live her life to the fullest
even as she battled her long illness. She was always cheerful and in-
credibly uncomplaining, always thoughtful of other people. Her coura-
geous struggle inspired the love and admiration of everyone who knew
her. She will be sorely missed.
Nan was born in San Diego, was graduated from Stanford, and after
her marriage in 1953, lived with her husband in Phoenix until they
moved to Washington in 1969. Here, she worked tirelessly and lovingly
at the Lutheran Home for the Aged as President of the Home's Auxil-
iary and for 8 years on the staff as director of volunteer service.
Whatever Nan was involved in, she was involved wholeheartedly,
whether it was the Lutheran Home, her International Neighbors Club,
her considerable duties as the wife of the Chief Justice, or as the won-
derful mother of their three children. She truly cared.
Also, one cannot omit mentioning her outstanding talents as a gour-
met cook and expert in all types of sewing and needlework. She was as
gifted as she was loving. We are all fortunate to have known her.
As a mark of our sorrow and of our affection for her and for our
brother, the Chief Justice, and for his family, the Journal of Court will
record that the adjournment of this Court today is in honor of Natalie
Rehnquist, her life, and her memory."

APPEAL SUMMARY DISPOSITION
-
No. 91–434. Hollis Watkins, et al., Appellants v. Ray Mabus, Gover-
nor of Mississippi, et al. Appeal from the United States District Court
for the Southern District of Mississippi. The judgment is affirmed ex-
cept with respect to appellants' claim that the preclearance require-
ments of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act apply to the changes in the
absentee ballot procedures adopted for the September 17 election or-
dered by the district court. The completion of the September 17 elec-
tion has rendered this claim moot with regard to the relief sought, i.e.,
an order enjoining the September 17 election for failure to comply with
preclearance requirements. Accordingly, we vacate that portion of the
judgment below with instructions to dismiss the relevant part of the
complaint. Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U. S. 490,
512-513 (1989); United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U.S. 36, 39-40
(1950). Justice Blackmun and Justice Stevens would note probable ju-
risdiction and set the case for oral argument.
CERTIORARI-SUMMARY DISPOSITION
No. 91-5518. Hamza Al Kashif, Petitioner v. United States. On peti-
tion for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the
Tenth Circuit. The motion of petitioner for leave to proceed in forma
pauperis and the petition for writ of certiorari are granted. The judg-
ment is vacated and the case is remanded to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Tenth Circuit for further consideration in light of the
position presently asserted by the Solicitor General in his brief for the
United States filed October 21, 1991.
