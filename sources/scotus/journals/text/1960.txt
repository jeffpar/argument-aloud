No. 38. New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad Company,
petitioner, v. Mary L. Donnelly Henagan. On writ of certiorari to
the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. Judgment
reversed and case remanded to the United States District Court for
the District of Massachusetts with directions to enter judgment for
the petitioner notwithstanding the verdict. Opinion per curiam an-
nounced by Mr. Chief Justice Warren. Mr. Justice Black and Mr.
Justice Douglas dissent because they believe there was evidence of
negligence sufficient for the jury, as summarized by Judge Woodbury,
speaking for a unanimous Court of Appeals, 272 F. 2d 153. They also
dissent from the direction to enter judgment for the defendant, since
they are of the view that if there is a reversal, there should be a new
trial. See Galloway v. United States, 319 U.S. 372, 396 (dissenting
opinion). For the reasons set forth in his opinion in Rogers v. Mis-
souri Pacific R. Co., 352, U.S. 500, 524, Mr. Justice Frankfurter is of
the view that the writ of certiorari was improvidently granted.

"The other orders of the Court have been certified by the Chief
Justice and filed with the Clerk and will not be announced orally."

ing under any of them are hereby enjoined from interfering with the

priate account of any and all sums of money derived by such State
since June 5, 1950, either by sale, leasing, licensing, exploitation or
otherwise from or on account of any of the lands or resources described

isiana the allocation, withdrawal and payment of any funds now im-
pounded under the Interim Agreement between the United States and

for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the

No. 704. St. Regis Paper Company, petitioner, v. United States.
Petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit granted limited to Questions 2, 3, 5, and 6
presented by the petition which read as follows:
"2. Does an order and judgment of the District Court under Sec-
tion 6(c) of the Administrative Procedure Act, modifying agency
investigative process, carry with it liability for forfeitures for non-
compliance with the original unmodified agency process?
"3. Did the orders of the Commission, purportedly issued pursuant
to Section 6(b) of the FTC Act, constitute a requirement that peti-
tioner furnish ‘answers in writing to specific questions', and not a
requirement of a 'special report', so that the provisions of the third
unnumbered paragraph of Section 10 of the FTC Act, providing
for forfeitures in the sum of $100 per day for each day of failure to
file a 'report', have no application?
"5. Are petitioner's retained file copies of confidential reports to
the Bureau of Census for the Census of Manufactures subject to the
investigative processes of the Commission?
"6. Does the investigative power asserted by the Commission under
Section 6(b) of the FTC Act, if not reviewable except at the risk of
paying forfeitures accumulated at the rate of $100 per day throughout
the period of noncompliance, including the period of judicial review,
deprive petitioner of its property without due process of law?”
Since time will not permit a hearing and determination of these
issues until our next Term, petitioner's motion pursuant to § 10 (d)
of the Administrative Procedure Act, 60 Stat. 243, 5 U.S.C. (1958

MONDAY, MARCH 27, 1961

of the writ of certiorari, the further running and accumulation of

723, 15 U.S.C. (1958 ed.) § 50. Petitioner's liability for forfeitures
accruing prior to February 7, 1961, is to abide the event of this
litigation.

ance Company. Petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court

writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Washington granted lim-

follows:
"1. Where accusation is by a grand jury indictment, does a person
(in this case a member and officer of a labor union who at the time
of the grand jury proceedings was the subject of continuous, extensive
and intensely prejudicial publicity) have a right under the due proc-
ess and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to have
the charges and evidence considered by a grand jury which was fair
and impartial or, at least, which was instructed and directed to act
fairly and impartially?
"(a) Where petitioner was a member and officer of a labor
union, and where prejudicial and inflammatory charges against
him were being widely and intensively disseminated by all
news media, did he have a right under the due process and equal
protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to have the
grand pury impaneled in a manner which would prevent or at
least tend to prevent the selection of biased and prejudiced grand
jurors?

MONDAY, APRIL 3, 1961
246
"(b) Was it a denial of due process and equal protection as
guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment for the Court, in the
course of instructing the grand jury, to make statements of an
inflammatory nature, prejudicial to petitioner, including a state-
ment that testimony before a United States Senate Committee
had disclosed that officers of the Teamsters Union (including
petitioner) ... had through trick and device, embezzled or
stolen hundreds of thousands of dollars of the funds of that
union-money which had come to the union from the dues of its
members...?'
"(c) Where petitioner's rights under the due process and equal
protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment violated by in-
flammatory statements of the prosecutors made in secret session
of the grand jury, including statements of disbelief of testimony
favorable to petitioner, threats of perjury charges against a wit-
ness who gave testimony favorable to petitioner, and other state-
ments of an inflammatory nature prejudicial to petitioner?
"2. Was the petitioner's right to a fair trial, as guaranteed by the
due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amend-
ment, violated where a timely motion for a continuance was denied,
although inflammatory and prejudicial statements concerning peti-
tioner had been widely and intensively disseminated in the press and
in national magazines, and through the media of radio and television,
commencing prior to the indictment of petitioner and continuing un-
til the date of trial?
"3. Was the petitioner's right to a fair trial, as guaranteed by the
due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, violated where a
seasonable application for a change of venue was denied, although
inflammatory and prejudicial statements concerning petitioner had
been widely and intensively disseminated in the press and in national
magazines, and through the media of radio and television, commenc-
ing prior to the indictment of petitioner and continuing until the date
of trial?"

ORDER
Ordered: 1. That Rules 25, 54, 62, and 86 of the Rules of Civil
Procedure and Forms Nos. 2 and 19, be, and they hereby are, amend-
ed as hereinafter set forth :
Rule 25. Substitution of Parties
(d) PUBLIO OFFICERS; DEATH OR SEPARATION FROM OFFICE.
(1) When a public officer is a party to an action in his
official capacity and during its pendency dies, resigns, or
otherwise ceases to hold office, the action does not abate and
his successor is automatically substituted as a party. Pro-
ceedings following the substitution shall be in the name of
the substituted party, but any misnomer not affecting the
substantial rights of the parties shall be disregarded. An
order of substitution may be entered at any time, but the
omission to enter such an order shall not affect the substitu-
tion.
(2) When a public officer sues or is sued in his official
capacity, he may be described as a party by his official title
rather than by name; but the court may require his name to
be added.

Rule 54. Judgments; Costs
263
(b) JUDGMENT UPON MULTIPLE CLAIMS OR INVOLVING MULTI-
PLE PARTIES. When more than one claim for relief is presented
in an action, whether as a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or
third-party claim, or when multiple parties are involved, the
court may direct the entry of a final judgment as to one or more
but fewer than all of the claims or parties only upon an express
determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon
an express direction for the entry of judgment. In the absence
of such determination and direction, any order or other form of
decision, however designated, which adjudicates fewer than all
the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties
shall not terminate the action as to any of the claims or parties,
and the order or other form of decision is subject to revision
at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the
claims and the rights and liabilities of all the parties.
Rule 62. Stay of Proceedings to Enforce a Judgment
(h) STAY OF JUDGMENT AS TO MULTIPLE CLAIMS OR MULTIPLE
PARTIES. When a court has ordered a final judgment under the
conditions stated in Rule 54(b), the court may stay enforcement
of that judgment until the entering of a subsequent judgment or
judgments and may prescribe such conditions as are necessary to
secure the benefit thereof to the party in whose favor the judg-
ment is entered.
Form 2. Allegation of Jurisdiction
(a) Jurisdiction founded on diversity of citizenship and
amount.
Plaintiff is a [citizen of the State of Connecticut] 2 [corporation
incorporated under the laws of the State of Connecticut having
its principal place of business in the State of Connecticut] and
defendant is a corporation incorporated under the laws of the
State of New York having its principal place of business in a
State other than the State of Connecticut. The matter in con-
troversy exceeds, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum of ten
thousand dollars.
(b) Jurisdiction founded on the existence of a Federal ques-
tion and amount in controversy.
The action arises under [the Constitution of the United States,
Article
Section -]; [the Amendment to the Con-
stitution of the United States, Section -]; [the Act of —,
2 Form for natural person.

Stat. - ; U.S.C., Title , §]; [the Treaty of the
United States (here describe the treaty) ],³ as hereinafter more
fully appears. The matter in controversy exceeds, exclusive of
interest and costs, the sum of ten thousand dollars.
(c) Jurisdiction founded on the existence of a question arising
under particular statutes.
The action arises under the Act of , Stat. - ; U.S.C.,
Title -, §- as hereinafter more fully appears.
,
EXPLANATORY NOTES
1. Diversity of Citizenship. U.S.C., Title 28, § 1332 (Diver-
sity of citizenship; amount in controversy; costs), as amended
by PL 85–554, 72 Stat. 415, July 25, 1958, states in subsection (c)
that "For the purposes of this section and section 1441 of this
title [removable actions], a corporation shall be deemed a citi-
zen of any State by which it has been incorporated and of the
State where it has its principal place of business." Thus if the
defendant corporation in Form 2(a) had its principal place of
business in Connecticut, diversity of citizenship would not exist.
An allegation regarding the principal place of business of each
corporate party must be made in addition to an allegation regard-
ing its place of incorporation.
2. Jurisdictional Amount. U.S.C., Title 28, § 1331 (Federal
question; amount in controversy; costs) and § 1332 (Diversity
of citizenship; amount in controversy; costs), as amended by
PL 85–554, 72 Stat. 415, July 25, 1958, require that the amount
in controversy, exclusive of interest and costs, be in excess of
$10,000. The allegation as to the amount in controversy may
be omitted in any case where by law no jurisdictional amount is
required. See, for example, U.S.C., Title 28, § 1338 (Patents,
copyrights, trade-marks, and unfair competition), § 1343 (Civil
rights and elective franchise).
3. Pleading Venue. Since improper venue is a matter of de-
fense, it is not necessary for plaintiff to include allegations show-
ing the venue to be proper. See 1 Moore's Federal Practice, par.
0.140 [1-4] (2d ed. 1959).
Use the appropriate phrase or phrases. The general allegation of the existence of a
Federal question is ineffective unless the matters constituting the claim for relief as set
forth in the complaint raise a Federal question.

Form 19. Motion To Dismiss, Presenting Defenses of Failure
To State a Claim, of Lack of Service of Process, of Improper
Venue, and of Lack of Jurisdiction Under Rule 12(b)
3. To dismiss the action on the ground that it is in the wrong
district because (a) the jurisdiction of this court is invoked solely
on the ground that the action arises under the Constitution and
laws of the United States and (b) the defendant is a corpora-
tion incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware and is
not licensed to do or doing business in the Southern District of
New York, all of which more clearly appears in the affidavits of
K.L. and V.W. hereto annexed as Exhibits C and D, respectively.
4. To dismiss the action on the ground that the court lacks
jurisdiction because the amount actually in controversy is less
than ten thousand dollars exclusive of interest and costs.
EXPLANATORY NOTES
1. The above motion and notice of motion may be combined
and denominated Notice of Motion. See Rule 7(b).
2. As to paragraph 3, see U.S.C., Title 28, § 1391 (Venue gen-
erally), subsections (b) and (c).
3. As to paragraph 4, see U.S.C., Title 28, § 1331 (Federal
question; amount in controversy; costs), as amended by PL 85–
554, 72 Stat. 415, July 25, 1958, requiring that the amount in con-
troversy, exclusive of interest and costs, be in excess of $10,000.
Rule 86. Effective Date
(d) EFFECTIVE DATE OF AMENDMENTS. The amendments
adopted by the Supreme Court on April 17, 1961, and transmitted
to the Congress on
---, 1961, shall take effect on
1961. They govern all proceedings in actions
brought after they take effect and also all further proceedings in
actions then pending, except to the extent that in the opinion of
the court their application in a particular action pending when
the amendments take effect would not be feasible or would work
injustice, in which event the former procedure applies.
2. That the Chief Justice be authorized to transmit these amend-
ments to Congress in accordance with the provisions of Title 28,
U.S.C., Sec. 2072.
3. Mr. Justice Black does not join in approval of the Rules because
he believes that it would be better for Congress to act directly by
legislation on the matters treated by the Rules.

4. Mr. Justice Douglas has filed the following statement:
"Most of the proposed changes in the Rules of Civil Procedure
are picayune and harmless, yet hardly worth making apart from any
overall revision of the Rules. The change in Rule 25 of the Rules
of Civil Procedure is, however, a major one; and it seems to me unwise.
The policy that a cabinet officer under one administration pursues
is often not the policy of the next administration. I would not make
the contrary assumption, as does the proposed change. I think the
ends served by Snyder v. Buck, 340 U.S. 15, are proper ones. The
Rule in its present form leaves the burden on the claimant who chal-
lenges a particular Government policy to re-establish that the con-
troversy he had with a predecessor is a live one as respects the suc-
cessor. The burden should rest there, not with the newcomer to
office.
"The critical language in Rule 25 (d) that is changed by the pro-
posed amendment derived from 28 U.S.C. § 780 which the Revised
Code dropped in 1949 because it had been incorporated in Rule 25 (d).
See 28 U.S.C., p. XXIX. The history of § 780 is reviewed in Snyder
v. Buck, supra, pp. 18–19.
"Congress dealt with the matter beginning with the Act of February
8, 1899, 30 Stat. 822. The care with which it approached the problem
is shown in H.R. Rep. No. 960, 55th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 2, where it
is said:
66 6
""A mandamus proceeding against an officer is based upon the
claim that he is personally refusing to perform some duty which
the law requires of him in his official character, and if decided
against him he is properly liable, personally, for all cost of the
proceeding, but if he vacates the office before a decision, it might
seem harsh to compel his successor to become a party to the suit
and to the costs already accrued without having been guilty of
any personal neglect of the official duty involved in the proceed-
ing; but to provide against this seeming harshness your com-
mittee propose to amend the bill so as to give the succeeding
official an opportunity to perform the official act involved in the
proceeding and thereby prevent the survival of the action against
himself, and if he fails to do so, he can not then complain of being
mulct in costs accruing against his predecessor.'
"The provision of § 780 that the action might be continued against
the successor in office on the requisite showing within the stated period
was added by § 11 of the Judiciary Act of 1925. 43 Stat. 936, 941.
The last word Congress spoke on the matter reflected the views in a
Report submitted by Chief Justice Taft dated March 11, 1922, which
explained § 11 in the following words:
Hi
'

MONDAY, APRIL 17, 1961
267
"It will be noted *** that the provision is not mandatory,
but leaves it to the sound discretion of the Court to determine
whether there is a substantial need for continuing the cause and
obtaining an adjudication of the questions involved. This will
tend to restrict the exercise of the right to cases which have a
sound basis.'
"This language was repeated in the Senate Committee print, 68th
Cong., 1st Sess., of A General Review of H.R. 10479, 67th Cong.,
p. 16. The language so carefully tailored by Congress is now re-
jected by the professional group who constitute our advisors in these
matters. I do not think we should allow a known and established
congressional policy to be so readily abrogated.
"We said in Snyder v. Buck, supra, p. 20, that if Rule 25 (d) is to be
amended in the manner then urged and now adopted 'the amending
process is available.' Where we have a matter so heavily encrusted
with legislative policy, I think any change should be left to Congress.
"I, therefore, dissent from the submission to Congress of the pro-
posed amendments to Rule 25 of the Rules of Civil Procedure under
28 U.S.C. § 2072. For under that Act the Rules submitted become
effective at the expiration of a 90-day period, unless Congress takes
contrary action. This machinery seems therefore inappropriate to
me for effecting such a basic change in congressional policy as the
proposed Rule 25 (d) achieves."
Ordered:
ORDER
1. That the Rules of Practice in Admiralty and Maritime Cases be,
and they hereby are, amended by including therein Rules 30A, 30B,
30C, 30D, 30E, 30F, 30G, 32D, 58, 59, and 60, and amendments to
Rules 32, 32B, and 32C(e), as hereinafter set forth :
Rule 30A
DEPOSITIONS PENDING ACTION
(a) WHEN DEPOSITIONS MAY BE TAKEN. Any party may
take the testimony of any person, including a party, by deposition
upon oral examination or written interrogatories for the purpose
of discovery or for use as evidence in the action or for both pur-
poses. After commencement of the action the deposition may
be taken without leave of court, except that leave, granted with
or without notice, must be obtained if notice of the taking is
served by the plaintiff within 20 days after commencement of
the action. The attendance of witnesses may be compelled by the
use of subpoena as provided in Rule 32D. Depositions shall be
taken only in accordance with these rules, except that depositions

MONDAY, APRIL 17, 1961
268
may also be taken under and used in accordance with sections
863, 864, and 865 of the Revised Statutes (see note preceding 28
U.S.C. § 1781). The deposition of a person confined in prison
may be taken only by leave of court on such terms as the court
prescribes.
(b) SCOPE OF EXAMINATION. Unless otherwise ordered by the
court as provided by Rule 30E (b) or (d), the deponent may be
examined regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant
to the subject matter involved in the pending action, whether it
relates to the claim or defense of the examining party or to the
claim or defense of any other party, including the existence, de-
scription, nature, custody, condition and location of any books,
documents, or other tangible things and the identity and location
of persons having knowledge of relevant facts. It is not ground
for objection that the testimony will be inadmissible at the trial
if the testimony sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to
the discovery of admissible evidence.
(c) EXAMINATION AND CROSS-EXAMINATION. Examination and
cross-examination of deponents may proceed as permitted at the
trial under the provisions of Rule 46A.
(d) USE OF DEPOSITIONS. At the trial or upon the hearing of
a motion or an interlocutory proceeding, any part or all of a depo-
sition, so far as admissible under the rules of evidence, may be
used against any party who was present or represented at the
taking of the deposition or who had due notice thereof, in ac-
cordance with any one of the following provisions:
(1) Any deposition may be used by any party for the purpose
of contradicting or impeaching the testimony of deponent as a
witness.
(2) The deposition of a party or of any one who at the time
of taking the deposition was an officer, director, or managing
agent of a public or private corporation, partnership, or associa-
tion which is a party may be used by an adverse party for any
purpose.
(3) The deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, may
be used by any party for any purpose if the court finds : 1, that the
witness is dead; or 2, that the witness is at a greater distance than
100 miles from the place of trial or hearing, or is out of the United
States, unless it appears that the absence of the witness was pro-
cured by the party offering the deposition; or 3, that the witness
is unable to attend or testify because of age, sickness, infirmity, or
imprisonment; or 4, that the party offering the deposition has
been unable to procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena;
or 5, upon application and notice, that such exceptional circum-
stances exist as to make it desirable, in the interest of justice and

with due regard to the importance of presenting the testimony of
witnesses orally in open court, to allow the deposition to be used.
(4) If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a
party, an adverse party may require him to introduce all of it
which is relevant to the part introduced, and any party may
introduce any other parts.
Substitution of parties does not affect the right to use deposi-
tions previously taken; and, when an action in any court of the
United States or of any state has been dismissed and another
action involving the same subject matter is afterward brought
between the same parties or their representatives or successors in
interest, all depositions lawfully taken and duly filed in the
former action may be used in the latter as if originally taken
therefor.
(e) OBJECTIONS TO ADMISSIBILITY. Subject to the provisions
of Rule 30G (c), objection may be made at the trial or hearing
to receiving in evidence any deposition or part thereof for any
reason which would require the exclusion of the evidence if the
witness were then present and testifying.
(f) EFFECT OF TAKING OR USING DEPOSITIONS. A party shall
not be deemed to make a person his own witness for any purpose
by taking his deposition. The introduction in evidence of the
deposition or any part thereof for any purpose other than that of
contradicting or impeaching the deponent makes the deponent the
witness of the party introducing the deposition, but this shall
not apply to the use by an adverse party of a deposition as de-
scribed in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of this rule. At the
trial or hearing any party may rebut any relevant evidence con-
tained in a deposition whether introduced by him or by any other
party.
Rule 30B
DEPOSITIONS BEFORE ACTION OR PENDING
(a) BEFORE ACTION.
APPEAL
(1) PETITION. A person who desires to perpetuate his own
testimony or that of another person regarding any matter that
may be cognizable in any court of the United States may file a
verified petition in the United States district court in the district
of the residence of any expected adverse party.
The petition shall be entitled in the name of the petitioner and
shall show: 1, that the petitioner expects to be a party to an
action cognizable in a court of the United States but is presently
unable to bring it or cause it to be brought, 2, the subject matter
of the expected action and his interest therein, 3, the facts which

MONDAY, APRIL 17, 1961
270
he desires to establish by the proposed testimony and his reasons
for desiring to perpetuate it, 4, the names or a description of the
persons he expects will be adverse parties and their addresses so
far as known, and 5, the names and addresses of the persons to
be examined and the substance of the testimony which he expects
to elicit from each, and shall ask for an order authorizing the
petitioner to take the depositions of the persons to be examined
named in the petition, for the purpose of perpetuating their
testimony.
(2) NOTICE AND SERVICE. The petitioner shall thereafter
serve a notice upon each person named in the petition as an ex-
pected adverse party, together with a copy of the petition, stating
that the petitioner will apply to the court, at a time and place
named therein, for the order described in the petition. At least
20 days before the date of hearing the notice shall be served
either within or without the district or state in the manner pro-
vided in Rule 4(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for
service of summons; but if such service cannot with due diligence
be made upon any expected adverse party named in the petition,
the court may make such order as is just for service by publica-
tion or otherwise, and shall appoint, for persons not served in the
manner provided in Rule 4(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, an attorney who shall represent them, and, in case they
are not otherwise represented, shall cross-examine the deponent.
If any expected adverse party is a minor or incompetent the
provisions of Rule 17 (c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Pro-
cedure apply.
(3) ORDER AND EXAMINATION. If the court is satisfied that
the perpetuation of the testimony may prevent a failure or
delay of justice, it shall make an order designating or describing
the persons whose depositions may be taken and specifying the
subject matter of the examination and whether the depositions
shall be taken upon oral examination or written interrogatories.
The depositions may then be taken in accordance with these rules,
and the court may make orders of the character provided for by
Rules 32 and 32A. For the purpose of applying these rules to
depositions for perpetuating testimony, each reference therein to
the court in which the action is pending shall be deemed to refer
to the court in which the petition for such deposition was filed.
(4) USE OF DEPOSITION. If a deposition to perpetuate testi-
mony is taken under these rules or if, although not so taken, it
would be admissible in evidence in the courts of the state in which
it is taken, it may be used in any action involving the same sub-
ject matter subsequently brought in a United States district court,
in accordance with the provisions of Rule 30A(d).

MONDAY, APRIL 17, 1961
271
(b) PENDING APPEAL. If an appeal has been taken from a
judgment of a district court or before the taking of an appeal if
the time therefor has not expired, the district court in which the
judgment was rendered may allow the taking of the depositions
of witnesses to perpetuate their testimony for use in the event of
further proceedings in the district court. In such case the party
who desires to perpetuate the testimony may make a motion in
the district court for leave to take the depositions, upon the same
notice and service thereof as if the action was pending in the
district court. The motion shall show (1) the names and ad-
dresses of persons to be examined and the substance of the testi-
mony which he expects to elicit from each; (2) the reasons for
perpetuating their testimony. If the court finds that the perpetu-
ation of the testimony is proper to avoid a failure or delay of
justice, it may make an order allowing the depositions to be taken
and may make orders of the character provided for by Rules 32
and 32A, and thereupon the depositions may be taken and used
in the same manner and under the same conditions as are pre-
scribed in these rules for depositions taken in actions pending in
the district court.
(c) PERPETUATION BY ACTION. This rule does not limit the
power of a court to entertain an action to perpetuate testimony.
Rule 30C
PERSONS BEFORE WHOM DEPOSITIONS
MAY BE TAKEN
(a) WITHIN THE UNITED STATES. Within the United States
or within a territory or insular possession subject to the dominion
of the United States, depositions shall be taken before an officer
authorized to administer oaths by the laws of the United States
or of the place where the examination is held, or before a person
appointed by the court in which the action is pending. A person
so appointed has power to administer oaths and take testimony.
(b) IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. In a foreign state or country
depositions shall be taken (1) on notice before a secretary of
embassy or legation, consul general, consul, vice consul, or con-
sular agent of the United States, or (2) before such person or offi-
cer as may be appointed by commission or under letters rogatory.
A commission or letters rogatory shall be issued only when neces-
sary or convenient, on application and notice, and on such terms
and with such directions as are just and appropriate. Officers
may be designated in notices or commissions either by name or
descriptive title and letters rogatory may be addressed "To the
appropriate Judicial Authority in [here name the country]".
リ

MONDAY, APRIL 17, 1961
272
(c) DISQUALIFICATION FOR INTEREST. No deposition shall be
taken before a person who is a relative or employee or attorney
or counsel of any of the parties, or is a relative or employee of
such attorney or counsel, or is financially interested in the action.
Rule 30D
STIPULATIONS REGARDING THE TAKING OF DEP-
OSITIONS
If the parties so stipulate in writing, depositions may be taken
before any person, at any time or place, upon any notice, and
in any manner and when so taken may be used like other
depositions.
Rule 30E
DEPOSITIONS UPON ORAL EXAMINATION
(a) NOTICE OF EXAMINATION: TIME AND PLACE. A party de-
siring to take the deposition of any person upon oral examina-
tion shall give reasonable notice in writing to every other party
to the action. The notice shall state the time and place for taking
the deposition and the name and address of each person to be
examined, if known, and, if the name is not known, a general
description sufficient to identify him or the particular class or
group to which he belongs. On motion of any party upon whom
the notice is served, the court may for cause shown enlarge or
shorten the time.
(b) ORDERS FOR THE PROTECTION OF PARTIES AND DEPONENTS.
After notice is served for taking a deposition by oral examination,
upon motion seasonably made by any party or by the person to
be examined and upon notice and for good cause shown, the court
in which the action is pending may make an order that the deposi-
tion shall not be taken, or that it may be taken only at some
designated place other than that stated in the notice, or that it
may be taken only on written interrogatories, or that certain
matters shall not be inquired into, or that the scope of the exam-
ination shall be limited to certain matters, or that the examina-
tion shall be held with no one present except the parties to the
action and their officers or counsel, or that after being sealed the
deposition shall be opened only by order of the court, or that
secret processes, developments, or research need not be disclosed,
or that the parties shall simultaneously file specified documents
or information enclosed in sealed envelopes to be opened as di-
rected by the court; or the court may make any other order which
justice requires to protect the party or witness from annoyance,
embarrassment, or oppression.

MONDAY, APRIL 17, 1961
273
(c) RECORD OF EXAMINATION; OATH; OBJECTIONS. The officer
before whom the deposition is to be taken shall put the witness
on oath and shall personally, or by some one acting under his
direction and in his presence, record the testimony of the witness.
The testimony shall be taken stenographically and transcribed
unless the parties agree otherwise. All objections made at the
time of the examination to the qualifications of the officer taking
the deposition, or to the manner of taking it, or to the evidence
presented, or to the conduct of any party, and any other objec-
tion to the proceedings, shall be noted by the officer upon the
deposition. Evidence objected to shall be taken subject to the
objections. In lieu of participating in the oral examination,
parties served with notice of taking a deposition may transmit
written interrogatories to the officer, who shall propound them
to the witness and record the answers verbatim.
(d) MOTION TO TERMINATE OR LIMIT EXAMINATION. At any
time during the taking of the deposition, on motion of any party
or of the deponent and upon a showing that the examination is
being conducted in bad faith or in such manner as unreasonably
to annoy, embarrass, or oppress the deponent or party, the court
in which the action is pending or the court in the district where
the deposition is being taken may order the officer conducting the
examination to cease forthwith from taking the deposition, or
may limit the scope and manner of the taking of the deposition
as provided in subdivision (b). If the order made terminates
the examination, it shall be resumed thereafter only upon the
order of the court in which the action is pending. Upon demand
of the objecting party or deponent, the taking of the deposition
shall be suspended for the time necessary to make a motion for an
order. In granting or refusing such order the court may impose
upon either party or upon the witness the requirement to pay
such costs or expenses as the court may deem reasonable.
(e) SUBMISSION TO WITNESS; CHANGES; SIGNING. When the
testimony is fully transcribed the deposition shall be submitted to
the witness for examination and shall be read to or by him, un-
less such examinaton and reading are waived by the witness and
by the parties. Any changes in form or substance which the
witness desires to make shall be entered upon the deposition by
the officer with a statement of the reasons given by the witness for
making them. The deposition shall then be signed by the witness,
unless the parties by stipulation waive the signing or the witness
is ill or cannot be found or refuses to sign. If the deposition is
not signed by the witness, the officer shall sign it and state on the
record the fact of the waiver or of the illness or absence of the
witness or the fact of the refusal to sign together with the reason,

MONDAY, APRIL 17, 1961
274
if any, given therefor; and the deposition may then be used as
fully as though signed, unless on a motion to suppress under
Rule 30G (d) the court holds that the reasons given for the
refusal to sign require rejection of the deposition in whole or in
part.
(f) CERTIFICATION AND FILING BY OFFICER; COPIES; NOTICE OF
FILING.
(1) The officer shall certify on the deposition that the witness
was duly sworn by him and that the deposition is a true record
of the testimony given by the witness. He shall then securely
seal the deposition in an envelope indorsed with the title of the
action and marked "Deposition of [here insert name of witness]"
and shall promptly file it with the court in which the action is
pending or send it by registered mail to the clerk thereof for
filing.
(2) Upon payment of reasonable charges therefor, the officer
shall furnish a copy of the deposition to any party or to the
deponent.
(3) The party taking the deposition shall give prompt notice
of its filing to all other parties.
(g) FAILURE TO ATTEND OR TO SERVE SUBPOENA; EXPENSES.
(1) If the party giving the notice of the taking of a deposition
fails to attend and proceed therewith and another party attends
in person or by attorney pursuant to the notice, the court may
order the party giving the notice to pay to such other party the
amount of the reasonable expenses incurred by him and his at-
torney in so attending, including reasonable attorney's fees.
(2) If the party giving the notice of the taking of a deposition
of a witness fails to serve a subpoena upon him and the witness
because of such failure does not attend, and if another party at-
tends in person or by attorney because he expects the deposition
of that witness to be taken, the court may order the party giving
the notice to pay to such other party the amount of the reasonable
expenses incurred by him and his attorney in so attending, in-
cluding reasonable attorney's fees.
Rule 30F
DEPOSITIONS OF WITNESSES UPON WRITTEN
INTERROGATORIES
(a) SERVING INTERROGATORIES; NOTICE. A party desiring to
take the deposition of any person upon written interrogatories
shall serve them upon every other party with a notice stating the
name and address of the person who is to answer them and the

MONDAY, APRIL 17, 1961
275
name or descriptive title and address of the officer before whom
the deposition is to be taken. Within 10 days thereafter a party
so served may serve cross interrogatories upon the party propos-
ing to take the deposition. Within 5 days thereafter the latter
may serve redirect interrogatories upon a party who has served
cross interrogatories. Within 3 days after being served with
redirect interrogatories, a party may serve recross interrogatories,
upon the party proposing to take the deposition.
(b) OFFICER TO TAKE RESPONSES AND PREPARE RECORD. A
copy of the notice and copies of all interrogatories served shall
be delivered by the party taking the deposition to the officer
designated in the notice, who shall proceed promptly, in the man-
ner provided by Rule 30E (c), (e), and (f), to take the testimony
of the witness in response to the interrogatories and to prepare,
certify, and file or mail the deposition, attaching thereto the
copy of the notice and the interrogatories received by him.
(c) NOTICE OF FILING. When the deposition is filed the party
taking it shall promptly give notice thereof to all other parties.
(d) ORDERS FOR THE PROTECTION OF PARTIES AND DEPONENTS.
After the service of interrogatories and prior to the taking of the
testimony of the deponent, the court in which the action is pend-
ing, on motion promptly made by a party or a deponent, upon
notice and good cause shown, may make any order specified in
Rule 30E which is appropriate and just or an order that the
deposition shall not be taken before the officer designated in the
notice or that it shall not be taken except upon oral examination.
Rule 30G
EFFECT OF ERRORS AND IRREGULARITIES IN
DEPOSITIONS
(a) As To NOTICE. All errors and irregularities in the notice
for taking a deposition are waived unless written objection is
promptly served upon the party giving the notice.
(b) AS TO DISQUALIFICATION OF OFFICER. Objection to taking
a deposition because of disqualification of the officer before whom
it is to be taken is waived unless made before the taking of the
depositions begins or as soon thereafter as the disqualification
becomes known or could be discovered with reasonable diligence.
(c) AS TO TAKING OF DEPOSITION.
(1) Objections to the competency of a witness or to the com-
petency, relevancy, or materiality of testimony are not waived
by failure to make them before or during the taking of the deposi-
tion, unless the ground of the objection is one which might have
been obviated or removed if presented at that time.

MONDAY, APRIL 17, 1961
276
(2) Errors and irregularities occurring at the oral examina-
tion in the manner of taking the deposition, in the form of the
questions or answers, in the oath or affirmation, or in the conduct
of parties and errors of any kind which might be obviated, re-
moved, or cured if promptly presented, are waived unless season-
able objection thereto is made at the taking of the deposition.
(3) Objections to the form of written interrogatories sub-
mitted under Rule 30F are waived unless served in writing upon
the party propounding them within the time allowed for serving
the succeeding cross or other interrogatories and within 3 days
after service of the last interrogatories authorized.
(d) As To COMPLETION AND RETURN OF DEPOSITION. Errors
and irregularities in the manner in which the testimony is trans-
cribed or the deposition is prepared, signed, certified, sealed, in-
dorsed, transmitted, filed, or otherwise dealt with by the officer
under Rules 30E and 30F are waived unless a motion to suppress
the deposition or some part thereof is made with reasonable
promptness after such defect is, or with due diligence might have
been, ascertained.
Rule 32D
SUBPOENA
(a) FOR ATTENDANCE OF WITNESSES; FORM; ISSUANCE. Every
subpoena shall be issued by the clerk under the seal of the court,
shall state the name of the court and the title of the action, and
shall command each person to whom it is directed to attend and
give testimony at a time and place therein specified. The clerk
shall issue a subpoena, or a subpoena for the production of docu-
mentary evidence, signed and sealed but otherwise in blank, to
a party requesting it, who shall fill it in before service.
(b) FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTARY EVIDENCE. A subpoena
may also command the person to whom it is directed to produce
the books, papers, documents, or tangible things designated there-
in; but the court, upon motion made promptly and in any event
at or before the time specified in the subpoena for compliance
therewith, may (1) quash or modify the subpoena if it is un-
reasonable and oppressive or (2) condition denial of the motion
upon the advancement by the person in whose behalf the sub-
poena is issued of the reasonable cost of producing the books,
papers, documents, or tangible things.
(c) SERVICE. A subpoena may be served by the marshal, by
his deputy, or by any other person who is not a party and is not
less than 18 years of age. Service of a subpoena upon a person

MONDAY, APRIL 17, 1961
277
named therein shall be made by delivering a copy thereof to
such person and by tendering to him the fees for one day's at-
tendance and the mileage allowed by law. When the subpoena
is issued on behalf of the United States or an officer or agency
thereof, fees and mileage need not be tendered.
(d) SUBPOENA FOR TAKING DEPOSITIONS; PLACE OF EXAMINA-
TION.
(1) Proof of service of a notice to take a deposition as pro-
vided in Rules 30E (a) and 30F (a) constitutes a sufficient author-
ization for the issuance by the clerk of the district court for the
district in which the deposition is to be taken of subpoenas for
the persons named or described therein. The subpoena may
command the person to whom it is directed to produce designated
books, papers, documents, or tangible things which constitute or
contain evidence relating to any of the matters within the scope
of the examination permitted by Rule 30A (b), but in that event
the subpoena will be subject to the provisions of subdivision (b)
of Rule 30E and subdivision (b) of this Rule 32D.
(2) A resident of the district in which the deposition is to
be taken may be required to attend an examination only in the
county wherein he resides or is employed or transacts his busi-
ness in person, or at such other convenient place as is fixed by
an order of court. A nonresident of the district may be required
to attend only in the county wherein he is served with a sub-
poena, or within 40 miles from the place of service, or at such
other convenient place as is fixed by an order of court.
(e) SUBPOENA FOR A HEARING OR TRIAL.
(1) At the request of any party subpoenas for attendance at
a hearing or trial shall be issued by the clerk of the district court
for the district in which the hearing or trial is held. A sub-
poena requiring the attendance of a witness at a hearing or trial
may be served at any place within the district, or at any place
without the district that is within 100 miles of the place of the
hearing or trial specified in the subpoena; and, when a statute
of the United States provides therefor, the court upon proper
application and cause shown may authorize the service of a sub-
poena at any other place.
(2) A subpoena directed to a witness in a foreign country shall
issue under the circumstances and in the manner and be served as
provided in Title 28, U.S.C., § 1783.
(f) CONTEMPT. Failure by any person without adequate ex-
cuse to obey a subpoena served upon him may be deemed a con-
tempt of the court from which the subpoena issued.

DISCOVERY AND PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS
AND THINGS FOR INSPECTION, COPYING, OR
PHOTOGRAPHING
Upon motion of any party showing good cause therefor and
upon notice to all other parties, and subject to the provisions of
Rule 30E (b). The court in which an action is pending may (1)
order any party to produce and permit the inspection and copy-
ing or photographing, by or on behalf of the moving party, of
any designated documents, papers, books, accounts, letters,
photographs, objects, or tangible things, not privileged, which
constitute or contain evidence relating to any of the matters
within the scope of the examination permitted by Rule 30A (b)
and which are in his possession, custody, or control; or (2) order
any party to permit entry upon designated land or other property
in his possession or control for the purpose of inspecting, meas-
uring, surveying, or photographing the property or any desig-
nated relevant object or operation thereon within the scope of
the examination permitted by Rule 30A (b). The order shall
specify the time, place, and manner of making the inspection
and taking the copies and photographs and may prescribe such
terms and conditions as are just.
Rule 32B
ADMISSION OF FACTS AND OF GENUINENESS OF
DOCUMENTS
(a) REQUEST FOR ADMISSION. After commencement of an
action a party may serve upon any other party a written request
for the admission by the latter of the genuineness of any relevant
documents described in and exhibited with the request or of the
truth of any relevant matters of fact set forth in the request. If
a plaintiff desires to serve a request within 10 days after com-
mencement of the action, leave of court, granted with or without
notice, must be obtained. Copies of the documents shall be
served with the request unless copies have already been furnished.
Each of the matters of which an admission is requested shall be
deemed admitted unless, within a period designated in the request,
not less than 10 days after service thereof or within such shorter
or longer time as the court may allow on motion and notice, the
party to whom the request is directed serves upon the party
requesting the admission either (1) a sworn statement denying
specifically the matters of which an admission is requested or
setting forth in detail the reasons why he cannot truthfully admit

MONDAY, APRIL 17, 1961
279
or deny those matters or (2) written objections on the ground
that some or all of the requested admissions are privileged or
irrelevant or that the request is otherwise improper in whole
or in part, together with a notice of hearing the objections at the
earliest practicable time. If written objections to a part of the
request are made, the remainder of the request shall be answered
within the period designated in the request. A denial shall fairly
meet the substance of the requested admission, and when good
faith requires that a party deny only a part or a qualification
of a matter of which an admission is requested, he shall specify
so much of it as is true and deny only the remainder.
(b) EFFECT OF ADMISSION. Any admission made by a party
pursuant to such request is for the purpose of the pending action
only and neither constitutes an admission by him for any other
purpose nor may be used against him in any other proceeding.

Rule 58
SUMMARY JUDGMENT
(a) FOR CLAIMANT. A party seeking to recover upon a claim,
counter-claim, or cross-claim, or to obtain a declaratory judg-
ment may, at any time after the expiration of 20 days from the
commencement of the action or after service of a motion for
summary judgment by the adverse party, move with or without
supporting affidavits for a summary judgment in his favor upon
all or any part thereof.
(b) FOR DEFENDING PARTY. A party against whom a claim,
counterclaim, or cross-claim is asserted, or a declaratory judg-
ment is sought may, at any time, move with or without supporting
affidavits for a summary judgment in his favor as to all or any
part thereof.
(c) MOTION AND PROCEEDINGS THEREON. The motion shall be
served at least 10 days before the time fixed for the hearing. The
adverse party prior to the day of hearing may serve opposing
affidavits. The judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if
the pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with

MONDAY, APRIL 17, 1961
280
the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment
as a matter of law. A summary judgment, interlocutory in char-
acter, may be rendered on the issue of liability alone although
there is a genuine issue as to the amount of damages.
(d) CASE NOT FULLY ADJUDICATED ON MOTION. If on motion
under this rule judgment is not rendered upon the whole case
or for all the relief asked and a trial is necessary, the court at
the hearing of the motion, by examining the pleadings and the
evidence before it and by interrogating counsel, shall if prac-
ticable ascertain what material facts exist without substantial
controversy and what material facts are actually and in good
faith controverted. It shall thereupon make an order specifying
the facts that appear without substantial controversy, including
the extent to which the amount of damages or other relief is
not in controversy, and directing such further proceedings in
the action as are just. Upon the trial of the action the facts
so specified shall be deemed established, and the trial shall be
conducted accordingly.
(e) FORM OF AFFIDAVITS; FURTHER TESTIMONY. Supporting
and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge,
shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence,
and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to
testify to the matters stated therein. Sworn or certified copies
of all papers or parts thereof referred to in an affidavit shall be
attached thereto or served therewith. The court may permit
affidavits to be supplemented or opposed by depositions or by
further affidavits.
(f) WHEN AFFIDAVITS ARE UNAVAILABLE. Should it appear
from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion that he
cannot for reasons stated present by affidavit facts essential to
justify his opposition, the court may refuse the application for
judgment or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to
be obtained or depositions to be taken or discovery to be had or
may make such other order as is just.
(g) AFFIDAVITS MADE IN BAD FAITH. Should it appear to
the satisfaction of the court at any time that any of the affidavits
presented pursuant to this rule are presented in bad faith or
solely for the purpose of delay, the court shall forthwith order
the party employing them to pay to the other party the amount
of the reasonable expenses which the filing of the affidavits
caused him to incur, including reasonable attorney's fees, and
any offending party or attorney may be adjudged guilty of
contempt.

DECLARATORY JUDGMENTS
281
The procedure for obtaining a declaratory judgment pursuant
to Title 28 U.S.C., § 2201, shall be in accordance with these rules,
and the right to trial by jury may be demanded under the cir-
cumstances and in the manner provided in Rules 38 and 39 of the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The existence of another
adequate remedy does not preclude a judgment for declaratory
relief in cases where it is appropriate. The court may order a
speedy hearing of an action for a declaratory judgment and may
advance it on the calendar.
Rule 60
EFFECTIVE DATES OF AMENDMENTS
(a) The amendments adopted by the Supreme Court on April
17, 1961, and reported to the Congress on
,
, 1961, shall
take effect on
1961. They are applicable to all pro-
ceedings in suits brought after they take effect and also to all
further proceedings in suits then pending, except to the extent
that in the opinion of the court their application in a particular
suit pending when the amendments take effect would not be
feasible or would work injustice, in which event the former pro-
cedure applies.
(b) Depositions taken prior to July 20, 1960, which would have
been authorized if Rules 30A through 30G had been in force at the
time such depositions were taken, and any depositions heretofore
taken by consent of the parties, may be used for any of the pur-
poses specified in Rule 30A (d).
2. That the Chief Justice be authorized to transmit these amend-
ments to Congress in accordance with the provisions of Title 28,
U.S.C., Sec. 2073.
3. Mr. Justice Black does not join in approval of the Rules because
he believes that it would be better for Congress to act directly by
legislation on the matters treated by the Rules.
4. Mr. Justice Douglas has filed the following statement:
"I concur in the amendments proposed to the Rules of Practice in
Admiralty and Maritime Cases. These amendments reflect a con-
tinuing need for discovery which the Court in Miner v. Atlass, 363 U.S.
641, found absent from existing admiralty procedures. The Rules, as
proposed, seem to me to be admirably suited for the purposes stated."

ORDER
IT IS ORDERED that paragraph 3 of Rule 48 of the Rules of this
Court be amended to read as follows:
"When a public officer is a party to a proceeding here in his official
capacity and during its pendency dies, resigns, or otherwise ceases to
hold office, the action does not abate and his successor is automatically
substituted as a party. Proceedings following the substitution shall
be in the name of the substituted party, but any misnomer not affect-
ing the substantial rights of the parties shall be disregarded. An
order of substitution may be entered at any time, but the omission to
enter such an order shall not affect the substitution."
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that a new paragraph 4 be added to Rule 48,
reading as follows:
"When a public officer is a party in a proceeding here in his official
capacity, he may be described as a party by his official title rather than
by name; but the Court may require his name to be added."
