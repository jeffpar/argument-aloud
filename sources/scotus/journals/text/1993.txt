a Resolution memorializing our regard for the late Justice Thurgood
Marshall and expressing our profound sorrow at his death. With the
Court’s leave, I am honored to present this resolution to the Court.

                            “Resolution”
   “The members of the Bar of the Supreme Court of the United States
met today to record our respect, admiration, and great affection for
Thurgood Marshall, who served this Court as Associate Justice from
1967 to the time of his retirement in 1991. A lawyer and jurist of world-
wide renown, Justice Marshall’s legal career of almost 60 years embod-
ied an unyielding commitment to equal justice under law.
   “While many great figures participated in the American struggle for
civil rights and civil liberties, none was more important than Thurgood
Marshall. His dedication to the living Constitution and legal institu-
tions of America kept him focused on the importance of individual
rights and liberties, not only for African-Americans, but also for
women, the poor, and other under-represented people. During his life-
time Thurgood Marshall dominated the legal landscape, tenaciously
pushing race relations along the path of equality in courtrooms, class-
rooms, and corporate boardrooms.
   “A chronicle of the extraordinary life and contributions of this legal
legend reveals the many facets of his character. As civil rights advo-
cate, as Associate Justice of this Court, as mentor, as leader, as ambas-
sador of good will, and as friend, he was a man of incredible vision and
unquestioned commitment. We owe an enormous debt of gratitude to
his devoted wife Cissy and his wonderful sons, Goody and John for
sharing him with us and with the nation. His inherent sense of fairness
and his faith in the basic decency of the American people, inspired his
advocacy, his writing, and his courage to imagine a better world and
to make the imagined world real.
   “Born on July 2, 1908, in Baltimore, Maryland, to William and
Norma Williams Marshall, young Thurgood attended the local elemen-
tary and secondary schools for “colored” children. His childhood memo-
ries of this segregated city—the unfair treatment and discrimination
he experienced first hand—etched indelible impressions in his mind.
His father worked as a Pullman car waiter and later as head steward
at the Gibson Country Club. His mother taught elementary school and
made great sacrifices to send young Thurgood to college at Lincoln
University in Chester County, Pennsylvania. She pawned her wedding
and engagement rings to help pay his college expenses. Marshall also
worked at numerous summer jobs to defray his expenses. Accepted

one summer for the position as a helper on the Pullman trains, he
inquired about obtaining a larger pair of trousers for his uniform to
accommodate his long legs. The white conductor glared at him saying,
‘Look boy, don’t you know that it is easier for me to get a new Negro
than a new pair of pants!’
   “Graduating with honors from Lincoln in 1929, Marshall knew that
rejection by the all white University of Maryland Law School was cer-
tain. He then made the fortunate decision to enroll at the Howard Uni-
versity School of Law in the District of Columbia. There he began
his apprenticeship and with Dean Charles Hamilton Houston, a great
constitutional scholar and creative genius who helped to develop the
civil rights strategies. Thurgood and his Howard colleagues refined,
defined, and implemented these strategies in the classrooms and even-
tually in the courts, leading to great victories in the 40’s, 50’s, and
the 60’s.
   “Marshall graduated first in his class from Howard in 1933 and began
private practice in Baltimore. But most of his time was spent in volun-
tary support of the local NAACP. One of his first cases was against the
University of Maryland Law School to force it to admit black students.
He succeeded and was responsible for the first black law student’s en-
rollment in 1935.
   “In 1936 Houston called Marshall to join him at the New York head-
quarters of the NAACP national legal staff. He was appointed chief
legal officer in 1938, following in the steps of Houston. In 1940, Marshall
helped to establish ‘the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund,
Inc.’ (popularly called the Inc. Fund or LDF) as a litigation and public
education entity separate from the NAACP. He served with great dis-
tinction as its Director/Counsel until his appointment to the Federal
Bench.
   “As the principal architect and exponent of the Inc. Fund’s civil
rights strategy, Marshall travelled constantly. He spent long hours,
even days devoted to the civil rights struggle analyzing and arguing
landmark cases. Even as he prepared for the ultimate civil rights battle
in the 1954 school cases, Buster, his first wife, was struggling with her
own fight against cancer. She never revealed how sick she was until
after the Brown decision. Her personal struggle inspired Marshall to
continue his fight for equal justice.
   “Thurgood Marshall waged extraordinary legal battles. For more
than 30 years he fought discrimination wherever it arose—in educa-
tion, in employment, in voting rights, and in the criminal law. As the
lead LDF trial attorney, he worked closely with Charles Houston,

William Hastie, William Coleman, Jack Greenberg Lou Pollak, and
other brilliant African-American and white lawyers who joined the
civil rights vanguard. Together this distinguished team labored to im-
plement a bold master plan for civil rights and litigate the cases that
established the legal foundation for Brown and its progeny. Of Mar-
shall’s thirty-two civil rights cases before the Supreme Court, He won
twenty-nine—an extraordinary record.
   “Clearly, each victory broke new ground. However, none was more
important in American jurisprudence and in the lives of millions of
people than the watershed decisions in Brown v. Board of Education
in Topeka, Kansas 347 U. S. 483 (1954); 349 U. S. 294 (1955). In these
unanimous decisions, the Supreme Court began the process of disman-
tling racial segregation in the Nation’s public schools.
   “The Court ruled that all children had the right to attend schools
that were not segregated by race. The decision struck down racial dis-
crimination in education and abandoned forever the doctrine of ‘sepa-
rate but equal’. With the help of Dr. Kenneth Clark, a noted black
psychologist, Marshall demonstrated the harm to children who were
forced into all black classrooms. Marshall argued persuasively and pas-
sionately for an end to this intolerable practice and to the insidious
justification based on the inherent inferiority of the black man.
   “Brown stands for the proposition that law can change the world and
that the Supreme Court, as the interpreter of the law, can play a force-
ful role in fulfilling the highest human values. The importance of the
Brown decision cannot be overstated. It repudiated the previous justi-
fications for legally sanctioned discrimination in the public classrooms
of America. Although elimination and erosion of the vestiges of dis-
crimination moved very slowly, Marshall never gave up hope. He never
despaired. He never stopped fighting for the elimination of inequality
and injustice wherever it appeared.
   “As important as Brown and its progeny were, they should not
eclipse Marshall’s accomplishment in fighting segregation at the ballot
box. As Marshall himself said: ‘I don’t know whether the voting case
or the desegregation case was more important. Without the ballot,
you have no citizenship, no status, no power in this country. But,
without the chance to get an education, you have no capacity to use
the ballot effectively.’1 In winning the ‘white only’ primary litigation,
Smith v. Allwright,2 Marshall teamed with Bill Hastie, his friend and

former Howard Professor, to win for African Americans a more sig-
nificant voice at the ballot box. While the impact of this decision was
not the immediate enlargement of the voting power of blacks, ‘it lent
legitimacy to the arguments of lawyers [such as Marshall] who contin-
ued to complain to the United States Attorney General about discrimi-
natory voting barriers in the South.’3 Ultimately, Marshall’s efforts
and those of his cooperating attorneys would forever change the face
of city halls, state legislatures, governors’ mansions, political parties,
and political nominating conventions. Eventually America came to ac-
cept black candidates for political office at the local, state and Federal
levels.
   “Marshall’s work outside of the United States reflected the breadth
of his concern for equity and fairness for people of color throughout
the world. During the fifties and sixties the emerging independent na-
tions of Africa turned to American constitutional scholars for assist-
ance in shaping the legal framework that would govern the new rights
and responsibilities of their citizens.
   “In 1961 Jomo Kenyatta, the great leader of Kenya, asked Thurgood
Marshall for help. Marshall traveled to London and Kenya, working
tirelessly for weeks with the Constitutional Conference of Kenya. He
relied on the model of fundamental rights in the American Declaration
of Independence and the Constitution. Marshall put into words a world
in which Kenyatta’s dream of an independent nation with a black ma-
jority population under the rule of law became a reality. Mindful of the
hardships and inequities of black Americans struggling to end segrega-
tion and to become full participants in the democratic process, Marshall
focused on the integrity of the electoral process, the legislative forum,
and the role of the courts in interpreting the basic tenets of the law
and in protecting the rights of the minority—in the case of Kenya a
white minority.
   “In 1951 Marshall traveled to Japan and Korea to investigate the
disproportionately high incidence of courts martials and disciplinary
actions against ‘colored’ soldiers. He found blatant disparities in
charges and punishment imposed on black soldiers when compared to
white soldiers in similar circumstances, especially in the Army. He
challenged the unfairness of treatment and the absence of any modi-
cum of due process in the ‘frontier justice’ of the military courts. With
his customary candor and persuasive arguments, Marshall was able to
document these practices, to bring this situation into public view, and

to enlist congressional pressure to curtail these discriminatory prac-
tices against black soldiers.
   “In 1961, President John F. Kennedy nominated Thurgood Marshall
for appointment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit. He was given a recess appointment in October, 1961 and con-
firmed by the Senate in 1962. Unfortunately, his confirmation was
stalled for a year by a group of segregationist Senators. Despite these
tactics, Marshall served with distinction as an appellate jurist for sev-
eral years. In 1965, President Lyndon Baines Johnson named him Solic-
itor General of the United States, the first African American to hold
that position. As the nation’s top appellate lawyer, Thurgood Marshall
successfully defended before the Supreme Court the constitutionality
of numerous statutes, including the 1965 Voting Rights Act which se-
cured equal voting privileges for all Americans.
   “In 1967 President Johnson called Marshall to the White House and
advised him of his intention to nominate Marshall to become an Associ-
ate Justice of the Supreme Court. As the first African-American in the
history of the United States so honored, Marshall’s becoming part of
the Court showed how much he had changed the world. Typically, Mar-
shall asked LBJ for a moment to share his news with his devoted wife
Cissy before the press was advised. Characteristically, he also said to
LBJ in a more serious tone, that he would ‘call them as he saw them’.
LBJ responded that he would expect nothing less. Although a bitter
Senate confirmation fight erupted again, Marshall was confirmed and
sworn in on August 20, 1967.
   “During his twenty-four year tenure on the Court, Justice Marshall
served as the conscience of the Court. With firm and unwavering
conviction, he aggressively challenged his colleagues and counsel on
issues of racism, bigotry, sexism, sexual preference, and prejudice
with his sharp mind, candid speech and powerful pen. His questions at
oral argument would unerringly uncover the fundamental issues of
fairness that lay at the core of the cases facing the Court. Often in
concert with his great friend and ally, William Brennan, Marshall ar-
gued against artificial barriers to human dignity and individual rights.
On many occasions Marshall dissented vigorously from what he be-
lieved to be the Court’s disregard for the rights of the elderly,4 of

   “Justice Marshall’s deep concern for protection of the Bill of Rights
led him to denounce efforts to stifle free speech,9 to defend his unwa-
vering belief that the imposition of the death penalty was unconstitu-
tional,10 and to voice repeatedly his outrage about violations of the
due process rights of criminal defendants.11 In powerful words Justice
Marshall’s opinions expressed the agony and the pain suffered those
facing charges. His concerns about their rights were particularly poi-
gnant because of his personal experiences as a young lawyer defending
black citizens who had been unjustly accused and punished by the crim-
inal justice system. Historians will certainly chronicle his impact on
American jurisprudence.
   “Even with his extraordinary commitment of time and energy to the
critical legal issues of the twentieth century, Thurgood Marshall still
found time to enjoy great personal contentment with his beloved wife,
Cissy. Cissy brought him love, compassion, and understanding. They
enjoyed the proud moments of parenthood with their sons, Thurgood,
Jr. (‘Goody’) and John. Justice Marshall took great pleasure in the fact
that both his sons chose careers in the law—Goody as an attorney and
counselor to Senator and now Vice President of the United States, Al-
bert Gore, Jr., and John as a Virginia State Trooper and instructor for
a statewide special services division. Marshall’s grandchildren brought
him great joy in his later years. He often regaled clerks with the latest
stories of young Will and the determination of little Cissy!
   “Justice Marshall served as a beacon of hope for generations of men
and women, young and old, African-American, Asian, Hispanic and
white who simply sought equal opportunities to live, to learn, to work,
and to share in the rights and liberties enjoyed by the majority of our
great nation. As we pay tribute to this extraordinary man of the law
today, we must never forget his extensive contribution to American
society. Thurgood Marshall made our country a better place for all
citizens—as leader, fighter, and defender of the underrepresented.

   “A brilliant lawyer, constitutional scholar and jurist, Thurgood Mar-
shall unselfishly dedicated himself to work for the NAACP Legal De-
fense Fund and for equal justice at the bar of this Court, altering not
only the course of race relations in America, but also the broader legal
landscape for future generations. His advocacy and his leadership ad-
vanced social and political understanding among all Americans. He vir-
tually created the ‘public interest lawyer’—who fought for individuals
and for a cause. Even as Thurgood Marshall and his loyal band of coop-
erating attorneys chipped away at the theory of ‘separate but equal’,
they painstakingly prepared the way for integration, weaving together
the fabric of a just society born out of a dynamic melange of people
from different ethnic, cultural, and racial backgrounds.
   “Throughout the early years, Thurgood Marshall showed extraordi-
nary inner strength and character that were the hallmarks of his life’s
work. Marshall willingly confronted both great physical risks and enor-
mous personal sacrifices. His life was often in danger; death threats
were common. In making trips to southern courthouses, there were
many close calls. Threats of lynching, assault, and murder were routine.
   “Marshall’s life and achievements continue to inspire young people
to follow his example, to sustain the legacy of the civil rights move-
ment, and to become advocates for equal rights under law. We must
not forget, however, the powerful commitment that kept Marshall on a
steadfast path. With limited resources at the Fund, Thurgood Marshall
had to piece his cases together, literally and figuratively. For example,
at LDF he had one old typewriter and carbon paper that had been
used and reused. His secretary, legal assistants, and even Marshall
himself sometimes went without pay for weeks when money was
needed for filing papers or paying train fare for an LDF lawyer to
appear at a trial. Even under these adverse conditions, Marshall never
wavered. His drive and commitment led him to do whatever was neces-
sary to get a case heard, to win the argument. Funds to support his
litigation effort were collected in churches, at rallies sponsored by the
NAACP, and from several financial angels who believed in the man and
his mission. Pennies, nickels and dimes—the collection was always
small but large enough to keep him going.
   “Contrast the Marshall experience with those of the thousands of
black elected officials at the local, state and Federal levels today with
multi-million dollar budgets, staffs, and support for the multifaceted
work that they perform. Thurgood Marshall had no such resources.
Today’s governmental leaders function in a very different world. But,

it is a world that could not exist without the pivotal foundation created
by Thurgood Marshall in the voting rights challenges, starting with
Smith v. Allwright. Changes in the political process occurred in the
United States not by magic, but by strategic planning, hard work, sac-
rifices, and risk-taking.
   “As Paul Gewirtz, a former Marshall clerk, has observed, President
Johnson’s historic announcement captured the essence of Marshall:
‘Thurgood Marshall symbolizes the best about our American society,
the belief that human rights must be satisfied through the orderly proc-
ess of law’.12 Robert Carter, a former LDF lawyer and currently a
federal judge, commented on his mentor’s most enduring characteris-
tic. He focused on
     ‘[Marshall’s] vivid, almost religious faith in the efficacy of the Na-
  tional Constitution in protecting the individual against government
  discrimination and abuse. He believed that the 13th, 14th and 15th
  Amendments to the United States Constitution were an updated
  Magna Carta, insuring equal citizen rights for blacks and that his
  mission was to see this concept of the Constitution become a firm
  facet of constitutional jurisprudence. He never faltered in this
  belief ’.13
  “This fundamental belief in the Constitution was the standard which
Marshall held high as a civil rights lawyer and as a Justice of the
Supreme Court of the United States. Justice Marshall brought to the
Court a unique understanding of real life. Having spent most of his
adult life working and living among ‘poor colored folks’ Marshall ‘knew
what police stations were like, what indignities emanated from rural
Southern life, what the streets of New York were like, what the corrupt
trial courts were like, what death sentences were like, what being black
in America was like and he knew what it felt like to be at risk as a
human being’.14 From these experiences Marshall could explain in
graphic human terms to his colleagues on the Court the difference the
law could make.
  “In a recent tribute, his colleague, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor,
poignantly captured his unique quality to demonstrate the impact of
legal rules on human lives:

    ‘His was the eye of a lawyer who had seen the deepest wounds in
  the social fabric and used law to help heal them. His was the ear of
  a counselor who understood the vulnerabilities of the accused and
  established safeguards for their protection. His was the mouth of a
  man who knew the anguish of the silenced and gave them a voice.’15
   “Whether in the majority or in dissent, Justice Marshall’s faith in
the Constitution encompassed more than the racial issues of his civil
rights days. Indeed, he saw the protection provided by the Constitution
as extending beyond color and racial constraints to preventing official
governmental abuse of any disadvantaged person. For example, Mar-
shall staunchly believed that equal protection meant equal—regardless
of color. In Peters v. Kiff16 Justice Marshall delivered the opinion of
the Court upholding a white defendant’s claim that the Constitution
was violated by the exclusion of blacks from the petit and grand juries.
‘The existence of a constitutional violation does not depend on the cir-
cumstances of the person making the claim’.17
   “Rejecting the argument of his dissenting brethren that the white
defendant was not harmed by the exclusion of blacks on the jury, Mar-
shall wrote convincingly that the exclusion of any large segment of the
community from juries ‘deprives the jury of a perspective on human
events that may have unsuspected importance in any case that may
be presented’.18
   “Justice Marshall’s belief that equal treatment transcended racial eq-
uity is evident in many of his opinions and dissents while a member of
this Court. Even with the changing judicial philosophy that marked
the majority opinions in his later years on the bench, he continued to
write most often in dissent about the Court’s neglect of the unfortunate
in our society.
   “Some have characterized Justice Marshall as ‘a storyteller’ or ‘a
curmudgeon’. Neither description is accurate nor appropriate to cap-
ture the essence of the man. Marshall was indeed a raconteur. But he
used his personal experiences with the indignities of the legal system
as a means to help his colleagues better understand why such behavior
and abuse should not be tolerated. His sometimes gruff demeanor re-
flected his impatience with the slow pace of true integration in
America.

  “Although he had confronted the depths of bigotry, hatred, and
selfishness, he never turned bitter but always aimed at ‘doing the best
you can do with what you’ve got.’ Justice Marshall held fast to his
fundamental belief in equality under the law. His position was never
sugar-coated nor served up as a softball. During the bicentennial cele-
bration of the Constitution, Marshall shocked many when he refused
to speak in platitudes about the document.
  “Instead, he reminded us that the Constitution did not condemn slav-
ery; rather the Constitution was defective at the start. Marshall ob-
served that:
  ‘. . . the credit belonged not to the framers who wrote the Constitu-
  tion in 1787, but to those in the ensuing 200 years who refused to
  acquiesce in outdated notions of liberty, justice and equality, and who
  strived to better them. The true miracle was not the birth of the
  Constitution, but its life.’
  ‘I plan to celebrate the Bicentennial of the Constitution as a living
  document. . . including the Bill of Rights and the other amendments
  protecting individual freedoms and human rights.’19
   “In August 1992, for example, Marshall could not resist reminding
the leadership of the American Bar Association of the historical exclu-
sion of black lawyers from the organization, even as it bestowed upon
him its highest honors. His comments on that occasion were quintes-
sential Marshall. ‘We’ve come a long way (pause), but we certainly
know how far we have to go. I hope you will stick with me in fighting
the fight for full civil rights and full civil liberties.’20
   “The legacy of Justice Marshall will live on in the men, women, and
children whose lives and souls he touched and all of those who bene-
fited from his legal triumphs. He dared to use the law as an instrument
of social change, and history will record that he succeeded. He human-
ized legal theories and dared to challenge the morality of law that
crushed the human spirit and denied black citizens the opportunity for
a decent life. The Bar of the Supreme Court speaks for all the lawyers,
judges, and citizens of this country when we say: Thank you, Mr. Jus-
tice Marshall, for opening our hearts and never letting us forget that
our society can only succeed when the least among us have the same
opportunity as the most privileged.’’

  The Chief Justice said:

of the United States.”
  Attorney General Reno addressed the Court as follows:
   “Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
   “The Bar of this Court met today to honor the memory of Thurgood
Marshall, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court from 1967 to 1991.
   “From his birth in Baltimore, Thurgood Marshall’s life was one of
public service. He was raised by loving parents who instilled in him
confidence in himself and pride in his heritage, and the habits of mind,
force of will, determination of character, and skill in advocacy that
would serve him and his country so well in later years.
   “Justice Marshall received his early education in the segregated pub-
lic schools of Baltimore, beginning in the elementary school where his
mother taught. He went on to attend Lincoln University, and between
his sophomore and junior years married his first wife, Vivien, who lent
her patience and support to his struggles, defeats and triumphs for 25
years, until her untimely death in 1955. After college he was denied
admission to study law at the University of Maryland because of his
race—an injustice he would rectify five years later when, only two
years out of law school himself, he obtained an order from the Maryland
Court of Appeals directing the University to enroll his client as its first
black law student.
   “That victory was made possible by the legal education Marshall
received at Howard University, where he prospered under the tute-
lage of Charles Houston, William Hastie, and other members of the
faculty, and graduated as valedictorian in 1933. It also marked the
beginning of his association with the NAACP, which Marshall joined as

a full-time staff lawyer in 1936. There, his law school mentors became
colleagues in the fight for equal rights for all Americans under the law.
   “Justice Marshall’s name first appeared on a brief in this Court in
1940, in the case of Chambers v. Florida. He presented his first oral
argument in this Court three years later in Adams v. United States,
besting the United States on a technical point of federal jurisdiction
over criminal conduct. From that year through his departure from the
NAACP Legal Defense Fund in 1961, Marshall argued sixteen times
before this Court, in cases whose names read today like a map of cross-
roads on the journey to equality: Smith v. Allwright, striking down
“white primaries” that kept black Americans disenfranchised; Morgan
v. Virginia, forbidding enforcement of state segregation laws on buses
and trains travelling in interstate commerce; Patton v. Mississippi,
invalidating convictions returned by juries from which African-Ameri-
cans had been systematically excluded; Sipuel v. Board of Regents and
Sweatt v. Painter, requiring the admission of qualified black students
to previously all-white state law schools; McGhee v. Sipes, reported as
Shelley v. Kraemer, forbidding state enforcement of restrictive racial
covenants in land deeds; Boynton v. Virginia, holding that refusing
service to a black man at a public restaurant in a bus terminal violated
the Interstate Commerce Act; and, of course, Brown v. Board of Edu-
cation and Cooper v. Aaron, in which this Court finally acknowledged
that ‘separate’ could not be ‘equal,’ and rejected the constitutional doc-
trine that had justified de jure segregation.
   “After the triumph of the Brown victory, Marshall was forced to
endure the heavy blow of the death from cancer of his first wife, known
affectionately as ‘Buster.’ During the period of continued frenetic activ-
ity that followed, however, it was his good fortune to meet and marry
Cecilia Suyat, his partner and companion for the remainder of his life,
and to have two fine sons, Thurgood Jr. and John William.
   “In 1961 President Kennedy nominated Marshall to a seat on the
United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit—only the sec-
ond African-American to be named to the federal appellate bench. The
Senate approved the nomination almost a year later, after a bruising
battle that reflected not upon the qualifications of the nominee, but
rather upon the power and prejudices of his political opponents. In his
relatively brief tenure on the court of appeals, Judge Marshall au-
thored, by one count, 118 majority opinions—not one of which was
reversed.
   “Judge Marshall left the court of appeals in 1964, when President
Johnson called upon him to put his formidable powers of advocacy to

use before this Court once again, this time as Solicitor General of the
United States. In his three years in that office, Solicitor General Mar-
shall argued nineteen additional cases before this Court. These cases
reflected the full range of the government’s business, from the assess-
ment of estate taxes, to the interrelationship between judicial and ad-
ministrative authority, to the complexities of securities and antitrust
law. Several, however, reflected his continuing passion for the protec-
tion and advancement of civil rights.
   “In Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections, for example, the
United States as amicus curiae successfully urged the Court to invali-
date poll taxes that burdened the right to vote. In United States v.
Guest and United States v. Price, the government successfully urged
reinstatement under the federal criminal civil rights statutes of indict-
ments brought against state officers and private citizens who cooper-
ated in the violation of other citizens’ civil rights, including those ac-
cused of the abduction and murder of civil rights workers James
Chaney, Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman. In Katzenbach v.
Morgan, the Court upheld, at the Solicitor General’s behest, the valid-
ity of the Voting Rights Act’s prohibition on disenfranchisement,
through an English literacy test, of voters educated in Puerto Rican
schools; and in Reitman v. Mulkey, the Court ultimately accepted the
position supported by the United States, as amicus curiae, that the
voters of a State could not enshrine in their fundamental law a public
endorsement of private discrimination. Finally, the Solicitor General
argued the government’s position in Westover v. United States, a com-
panion case to Miranda v. Arizona—perhaps the only case of his ca-
reer which the future Justice may not have been altogether sorry to
see his client lose.
   “On June 13, 1967, President Johnson nominated Thurgood Marshall
to fill the vacancy on this Court created by the retirement of Justice
Tom Clark. The first African-American to join this Court, Justice Mar-
shall took his seat on October 2, 1967. In his 24 terms on the Court,
the Justice delivered a total of 769 opinions, including 322 majority or
plurality opinions, 84 concurrences, and 363 dissents. In every case, he
could be counted on to combine a deep respect for the law and for the
institutional role of the Court, with an equally deep appreciation of
how both the law and the Court’s decisions actually affected real people
in an uncloistered world.
   “Justice Marshall’s first opinion for the Court reflected his abiding
concern that criminal defendants be afforded the professional assist-

being done in the courts. In Mempa v. Rhay, he spoke for a unanimous
Court in holding that the Court’s earlier decision in Gideon v. Wain-
wright, requiring appointment of counsel for indigent defendants in
felony cases, applied at ‘every stage of a criminal proceeding where
substantial rights of a criminal accused may be affected,’ including a
post-probation sentencing proceeding. Similarly, his opinion for the
Court in Bounds v. Smith confirmed that prison authorities were re-
quired to make their prisoners’ right of access to the courts meaning-
ful—while reserving to those authorities appropriate discretion to de-
termine whether they would do so by providing adequate law libraries,
furnishing professional assistance, or through some other means.
   “Even when he found himself in disagreement with the Court’s hold-
ings in criminal matters, Justice Marshall could write eloquently to
remind us all that as eternal vigilance is the price of liberty, so vigilant
protection of the rights of others is the price that we must be prepared
to pay to preserve the rights we take for granted for ourselves. In
United States v. Salerno, for example, he dissented from the Court’s
holding that Congress and the courts could constitutionally provide for
the pre-trial detention of certain defendants deemed to present a
threat to the public safety. Whatever our views on that particular issue,
we can all recognize the wisdom of Justice Marshall’s warning that:
  ‘Our Constitution, whose construction began two centuries ago, can
  shelter us forever from the evils of . . . unchecked power. . . . But it
  cannot protect us if we lack the courage, and the self-restraint, to
  protect ourselves.’
   “Although a believer in consensus, compromise, and precedent, Jus-
tice Marshall could be implacable when his conscience and his legal
judgment led him to conclude that one of this Court’s conclusions was
in error. His long and scholarly concurring opinion in Furman v. Geor-
gia set forth his carefully considered view that capital punishment was
excessive, unnecessary, and morally unacceptable. Having reached that
conclusion, he steadfastly refused to depart from it during the remain-
der of his tenure on the Court, consistently dissenting in cases where
the Court upheld imposition of the death penalty, and from innumera-
ble denials of certiorari in capital cases.
   “Justice Marshall retained, of course, advocate Marshall’s pressing
interest in issues of equal protection of the laws and the safeguarding
of fundamental rights. In his second term on the Court the new Justice
delivered the opinion in Stanley v. Georgia, holding that a person could

                        MONDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 1993                   311
not be prosecuted for mere possession of obscene material in his own
home. Rejecting what he termed ‘the assertion that the State has the
right to control the moral content of a person’s thoughts,’ he made
clear that
  ‘[i]f the First Amendment means anything, it means that a State has
  no business telling a man, sitting alone in his own house, what books
  he may read or what films he may watch. Our whole constitutional
  heritage rebels at the thought of giving government the power to
  control men’s minds.’
A few years later, Justice Marshall wrote for the Court in striking
down more than minimal state residency requirements imposed on a
citizen’s right to vote. He supported the enforcement of a constitutional
right of privacy, and argued in dissent for a fundamental right to child-
hood education, and for close constitutional scrutiny of legislative
schemes that he believed denied some citizens equal treatment or op-
portunity solely on the basis of their wealth. In his early years on
the Court he lent his powerful voice and personal experience to its
consideration of cases involving the continuing struggle for desegrega-
tion; and when he believed that the Court had strayed from the correct
path on those issues or in cases involving related questions of affirma-
tive, race-conscious remedies for past discrimination, he did not hesi-
tate to raise that voice in public dissent.
   “Justice Marshall’s contributions to the work of the Court extended,
of course, far beyond cases dealing with criminal prosecutions and civil
rights. During his time on the Court, he authored important opinions
in areas as diverse as securities law, federal environmental law, Indian
law, and tax law. In all contexts, his fundamental concern for ensuring
both fair procedures and substantial justice—and his sense of the law
as functional and evolving, rather than static and formalistic—re-
mained steadfast.
   “In Shaffer v. Heitner, for example, Justice Marshall led the Court
in holding that defendants could not be held to answer to suit in Dela-
ware merely because they owned stock and other intangible assets
with a nominal legal situs in that State. His opinion carefully traced
the historical development of limitations on state court jurisdiction,
and concluded that the functional standard that had gradually evolved
for purposes of in personam jurisdiction, focusing on ‘the relationship
among the defendant, the forum, and the litigation,’ should be applied
to in rem jurisdiction as well. In adopting that standard, he wrote for
the Court that:
JNL93$1115—10-04-00 15:28:11     JOURNAPGT          MILES




312                     MONDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 1993

  ‘traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice’ can be as
  readily offended by the perpetuation of ancient forms that are no
  longer justified as by the adoption of new procedures that are incon-
  sistent with the basic values of our constitutional heritage. * * * The
  fiction that an assertion of jurisdiction over property is anything but
  an assertion of jurisdiction over the owner of the property supports
  an ancient form without substantial modern justification. Its contin-
  ued acceptance would serve only to allow state-court jurisdiction
  that is fundamentally unfair to the defendant.’
   “That willingness to regard legal history and traditions with a re-
spectful but sharp eye, and to modify or reject them forthrightly if
they no longer served their purposes in the modern context, was char-
acteristic of Justice Marshall’s jurisprudence. He believed deeply in the
law; but he saw the law not as an impersonal abstraction, but as a
living instrument in the service of a living people. In reflecting on
the bicentennial of the United States Constitution, Justice Marshall
cautioned pointedly that:
  ‘We must be careful, when focusing on the events which took place in
  Philadelphia two centuries ago, that we not overlook the momentous
  events which followed, and thereby lose our proper sense of perspec-
  tive. If we seek, instead, a sensitive understanding of the Constitu-
  tion’s inherent defects, and its promising evolution through 200 years
  of history, [w]e will see that the true miracle was not the birth of the
  Constitution, but its life.’
Indeed, as the Justice again reminded us, while precarious and imper-
fect in its origins, ‘[o]ver 200 years [the Constitution] has slowly,
through our efforts, grown more durable, more expansive, and more
just.’
   “Both at the bar of this Court and on its bench, Thurgood Marshall
played an uncommonly important and historic role in those efforts.
Were he here now, he would, I think, admonish us to remember that
the great work is not finished. His labors may be concluded, but he has
left the living law, and the Constitution, in our care.
   “Mr. Chief Justice, on behalf of the lawyers of this Nation and, in
particular, of the Bar of this Court, I respectfully request that the
resolutions presented to you in honor and celebration of the memory
of Justice Thurgood Marshall be accepted by the Court, and that they,
together with the chronicle of these proceedings, be ordered kept for
all time in the records of this Court.”
   The Chief Justice said:

                       MONDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 1993                   313
   “Ms. Reno and General Days, the Court thanks you on behalf of the
Bar for your presentation today in memory of our late colleague and
friend, Justice Marshall.
   “We ask that you convey to Chairman Louis H. Pollak and the mem-
bers of the Committee on Resolutions our profound appreciation for
these Resolutions. Your motion that they be made part of the perma-
nent record of the Court is hereby granted.
   “Thurgood Marshall’s service to the public spanned sixty years,
twenty-four as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United
States. For almost a quarter of a century he was an important voice in
shaping the decisional law of the Supreme Court. His contributions to
the Court, and especially to American Constitutional law, demonstrate
his dedication, desire and insightful perspective on the key issues of
our time. His legacy of decisions as a jurist speaks for itself.
   “In his twenty-four years on the Supreme Court bench, Justice Mar-
shall wrote 322 full opinions for the Court, 84 concurrences and 363
dissents. Although chiefly known for decisions championing the rights
of indigent litigants and criminal defendants which both of you have
adverted to in your presentations, his influence extended well beyond
those issues. He authored, for example, in the opinion for Court in
Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., and FCC v. Florida
Power Corp., watershed decisions interpreting the Constitution’s pro-
hibition against the governmental taking of private property without
just compensation. These cases show how Justice Marshall contributed
across a wide range of constitutional law.
   “The great majority of Supreme Court Justices are almost always
remembered for their contributions to constitutional law as a member
of this Court. Justice Marshall, however, is unique because of his con-
tributions to constitutional law before becoming a member of the Court
were so significant. Beginning with his solo practice in Baltimore in
the early 1930s, and extending through his tenure as chief legal counsel
for the NAACP Legal defense and Education Fund, he became a cham-
pion of minorities, the poor, and individual rights. He fought many
rounds in the battle against school segregation, a battle which culmi-
nated with his victory in the case of Brown v. Board of Education.
   “Justice Marshall argued 31 additional cases before this Court, thir-
teen as a private attorney and eighteen as Solicitor General of the
United States. He won twenty-eight of those cases. Included in those
cases are some that both of you mentioned, Smith v. Allwright, Shel-
JNL93$1115—10-04-00 15:28:11     JOURNAPGT          MILES




314                     MONDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 1993

ley v. Kraemer, and Sweatt v. Painter. These efforts alone would entitle
him to a prominent place in American history had he never entered
upon judicial service.
   “We who sat with him during the time on the Court learned to value
his wise counsel in Conference. We also looked forward to those occa-
sions on which he would recount some of his experiences as a civil
rights lawyer in often bitterly hostile towns and distinctly unfriendly
courtrooms. He had the remarkable facility—not given to most story-
tellers—of not re-telling the same story to the same audience. Many of
these stories had a humorous twist to them, but they also gave us a
sense of what he had been up against in many of his cases. His forays
to represent his clients required not only diligence and legal skill, but
physical courage of a high order.
   “As a result of his career as a lawyer and judge, Thurgood Marshall
left an indelible mark not just upon the law but upon his country. In-
scribed above the front entrance to this Court building are the words,
‘Equal Justice Under Law.’ Surely no individual did more to make
these words a reality than Thurgood Marshall.”

  The Chief Justice said:
  “The Court today notes the retirement of the Marshal of the Court,
Alfred Wong. Mr. Wong has called the Court to order and has recessed
the Court since his appointment in July 1976. The Marshal of the
Court is responsible for all those housekeeping functions that keep the
building running smoothly such as paying the bills, preparing the pay-
roll, maintaining security for the Court and for those of us who work
here, and coordinating the numerous official and social functions that
take place here daily. Mr. Wong has performed his duties with due

diligence, and the Court thanks him. The entire Court family extends
to Mr. Wong and his family best wishes for a healthy and happy retire-
ment. The Court has appointed Dale E. Bosley as Marshal of the Court,
effective August 1, 1994.
   “The past decade or so has brought the Court into the age of comput-
erization, and the person principally responsible for the smooth transi-
tion—James Donovan—is retiring this summer. The Court, and the
Staff of the Court, extend to him our sincerest thanks for making this
transition easier for all of us. We wish Mr. Donovan and his family
happiness in the coming years.
   “I also wish to note for the record that my very capable Administra-
tive Assistant, Robb Jones, is leaving the Court family this summer.
Mr. Jones has served not only me and my colleagues on the bench in
an exemplary manner, but he has served well the federal judiciary and
this Court’s staff. I wish him and his family well in future endeavors.
Mr. Jones’ successor will be named in due course.”
  The Chief Justice said:
  “And we must also note with sadness that this is the last session in
which our friend and colleague Harry Blackmun will be with us, and
on this occasion we have sent Justice Blackmun the following letter
which I will now read:
                                                          June 21, 1994
  “Dear Harry,
  “Your colleagues are sad that you have chosen to retire from the
Court. You came here twenty-four years ago—longer ago than any of
us—and have served with no less than sixteen different members.
  “Your opinions have covered a wide range of the issues that come
before the Court. You are undoubtedly best known for having authored
the Court’s opinion in Roe v. Wade in 1973, but that distinction should
not obscure the many other important issues on which you have spoken
for the Court. Your contributions have not been limited to signed opin-
ions, but include as well your wise counsel in our Conference. And,
though it has nothing to do with our judicial work, you have made a
major improvement in the cultural life of the Court with your sponsor-
ship of our biennial musical performances.

  “We shall miss you—especially if you go through with your present
plans to move to Florida. But whether in Washington or Jacksonville,
we wish you the very best.”

                                  Sincerely,

  Justice Blackmun said:
  “I suppose I should read my response to the cordial letter that has
just been written and here it is:
                                                        June 22, 1994
  “My Dear Colleagues:
  “Your cordial letter brightens my day.
  “It has been a privilege for me to have been on the Federal Bench
for over three decades and on this Court for over two. I have sat now
with 17 Justices of the Court, about 15% of all those who have served
since 1790. And I have had the privilege of knowing eight others whose
service was complete before I arrived here. You and the ones before
you who have departed since 1970 have provided pleasant friendship,
professional inspiration, imagination, instruction, and a sense of worth-
while service in a common devotion to our imperfect but beloved coun-
try. At times, our task has been heavy, the hours long, and the stress
substantial. Byron reminded us that ‘the Court is a very small organi-
zation for the weight it carries.’ But always there was an awareness
that we were all in this together, and that the system seemed to be
working. And there was the conviction that this was the way it was
meant to be and that it would work out all right. What a comfort that
has been, and what a comfort it has been to work with each of you
and with others of our predecessors who have deliberated around our
conference table.
  “As an old canoeist myself, I share Bill Douglas’ vivid and eloquent
description of our work together, the occasional long and strenuous
portages, and the last night’s and the last morning’s campfires, as he

set it forth in his retirement letter of November 14, 1975. 423 U. S. ix.
It is so true that the Justices of the Court are ‘strangers at the begin-
ning but almost invariably are close friends at the end.’ So it was for
him. So it was for me. And so it has been, I think, for each of us. We
have been gathered from different places and through the influence of
different forces. That is one of the remarkable aspects of this Court
and of the experience of service upon it.
   “Let us hope that, in the years far down the line, when history even-
tually places us in such perspective as we deserve, it at least will be
able to say: ‘They did their best and did acceptably well.’ If that comes
to be said, it is because of your cooperation, your understanding, your
patience, and your acknowledgment that ours is a common, not an indi-
vidual, task, and that we strove, in our small ways and with our limited
capabilities, for the righting of injustices of both ancient and current
origins. For all this, I am grateful.”

                                 Sincerely,

                                 Harry
  The Chief Justice said:
  “I am authorized to announce that all cases submitted to the Court
for decision have been acted upon by the Court. An order list disposing
of additional cases will issue later this afternoon. Accordingly, it is
ordered that those cases remaining on the docket, but not ready for
consideration, are continued to the session of the Court beginning Oc-
tober 3, 1994, at which time the October 1993 Term will adjourn.
  “For the first time in history, the Court this Term had over 7700
cases on its docket. Without the commitment and professionalism of
the Court staff, such a docket might not be manageable. This dedication
by the staff to the work of the Court is recognized by the Bar and the
public. On behalf of each Justice, I thank all members of the Supreme
Court staff for their sustained dedication to the work of the Court
during the Term.”


  Adjourned until Monday, October 3, 1994, at 10 o’clock.

  The Marshal said:

  The Chief Justice said:
  “On behalf of the Court, Mr. President, I extend to you a warm
welcome. This special sitting of the Court is held today to receive the
Commission of the newly appointed Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court of the United States, Stephen Breyer. The Court now recognizes
the Attorney General of the United States, Ms. Janet Reno.”
  The Attorney General said:
  “Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, I have the Commis-
sion which has been issued to the Honorable Stephen Breyer as an
Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. The Com-
mission has been duly signed by the President of the United States
and attested by me as the Attorney General of the United States. I
move that the Clerk read the Commission and that it be made part of
the permanent records of this Court.”
  The Chief Justice said:
  “Thank you, Ms. Reno, your motion is granted. Mr. Clerk, will you
please read the Commission?”
  The Clerk read the Commission:
  “William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States of
America,
  “To all Who Shall See These Presents, Greeting:
  “Know Ye; That reposing special trust and confidence in the wisdom,
uprightness, and learning of Stephen G. Breyer, of Massachusetts, I
have nominated, and, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,
do appoint him an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the
United States and do authorize and empower him to execute and fulfill
the duties of that office according to the Constitution and Laws of the
said United States, and to Have and to Hold the said Office, with all
the powers, privileges and emoluments to the same of right appertain-

  “In Testimony whereof, I have caused these Letters to be made pat-
ent and the seal of the Department of Justice to be hereunto affixed.
  “Done at the City of Washington, this Second Day of August, in the
year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and ninety-four, and of
the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred
and nineteenth.
  “By the President: William Jefferson Clinton.
  “Janet Reno, Attorney General.”
  The Chief Justice said:
  “I now ask the Chief Deputy Clerk of the Court to escort Justice
Breyer to the bench.”
  The Chief Justice said:
  “Justice Breyer, are you ready to take the oath?”
  Justice Breyer said:
  “I am.”
  The Chief Justice said:
  “Please repeat after me.”
   Justice Breyer said:
   “I, Stephen Breyer, do solemnly swear that I will administer justice
without respect to persons and do equal right to the poor and to the
rich and that I will faithfully and impartially discharge and perform
all the duties incumbent upon me as an Associate Justice of the Su-
preme Court of the United States under the Constitution and laws of
the United States, so help me God.”
   The Chief Justice said:
   “Justice Breyer, on behalf of all the members of the Court, it is a
pleasure to extend to you a very warm welcome as the 108th Justice
of the Court and to wish you a long and happy career in our common
calling.
   “Justice Breyer is the sixth member of the Court to be appointed
since I became Chief Justice eight years ago. Justices Scalia, Kennedy,
Souter, Thomas and Ginsburg preceded him during that period. This
rapid rate of change in our membership contrasts markedly with the
period beginning in 1972, when Justice Powell and I came on the
Court, and ending in 1986, when Chief Justice Burger retired. During
that fourteen year period only four new Justices—I, Justice Powell,
Justice Stevens, and Justice O’Connor—were appointed to the Court.
And with the retirement of Justice Blackmun this summer, for the
first time in nearly a half century—since Harlan Stone presided over

the Court from 1941 to 1946—the Chief Justice is also the senior Jus-
tice in point of service. It makes me feel very ancient, indeed.”
   “Effective with the appointment of Justice Breyer, an order has
been entered by the Court today allotting the circuit justices as
follows:
   District of Columbia, Fourth and Federal Circuits: Chief Justice
   First and Third Circuits: Justice Souter

   Sixth and Seventh Circuits: Justice Stevens
   Eighth Circuit: Justice Thomas
   Ninth Circuit: Justice O’Connor
   Tenth Circuit: Justice Breyer
   Eleventh Circuit: Justice Kennedy”
   The Marshal said:
   “The Honorable Court is now adjourned until Monday, next, at 10
o’clock. The Court requests guests to remain in the Courtroom while
