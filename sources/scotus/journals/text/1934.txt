SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
75
Present: The Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Van Devanter, Mr. Justice
Brandeis, Mr. Justice Butler, Mr. Justice Stone, Mr. Justice Roberts,
and Mr. Justice Cardozo.
Frank H. Towsley, of New York City; Thomas L. Marshall, of
Chicago, Ill.; Joseph S. Lewis, of Ponca City, Okla.; Dale Travis
Lias, of Pittsburgh, Pa.; George Henry Huft, of Philadelphia, Pa.;
H. R. Colwell, of East Falls Church, Va.; John Leo Quinlan, of New
York City; and H. Loy Anderson, of Ocala, Fla., were admitted to
practice.
The Chief Justice announced the following order:
No. 186. Fannie Abrams et al., appellants, v. George S. Van
Schaick as Superintendent of Insurance of the State of New York
et al. Appeal from the Supreme Court of the State of New York.
Per curiam: The Court of Appeals of the State of New York
reversed an order of the Special Term of the Supreme Court which
enjoined the Superintendent of Insurance from making any payments
for expenditures incurred in connection with plans of reorganization
promulgated under Chapter 745 of the Laws of 1933 relating to
guaranteed participating certificates sold by the New York Title
and Mortgage Company. The motion for injunction, denied by the
Court of Appeals, was made in advance of the promulgation of a
plan by the Superintendent of Insurance applicable to the interests
of the appellants. Whether, if a plan of reorganization is promul-
gated by the Superintendent of Insurance it will be approved by the
Court as required by the statute, or whether, if so approved, it will
be opposed by certificate holders, or will receive the assent of the
present appellants, or will operate to deprive them of any asserted
constitutional right, are matters of conjecture. The appeal is dis-
missed for the want of a substantial Federal question. Liverpool,
New York & Philadelphia S. S. Co. v. Commissioners of Emigration,
113 U. S. 33, 39; California v. San Pablo & Tulare R. R. Co., 149
U. S. 308, 314; Stearns v. Wood, 236 U. S. 75, 78; Cincinnati v.
Vester, 281 U. S. 439, 449.

MONDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1934
The Chief Justice said:
76
"The other orders of the Court appear upon the list certified to
by the Chief Justice and filed with the Clerk and will not be
announced orally."
No. 42. E. R. Squibb & Sons v. Mallinckrodt Chemical Works.
On certificate from the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for
the Eighth Circuit. Per curiam: The Circuit Court of Appeals has
certified the following questions: "Question 1. Where, on an appeal
properly in this court, the appellee contends that one of the assign-
ments of errors has been abandoned and all others are not presentable
because defective either as assignments of errors or as specifications
of errors and urges affirmance of the decree appealed from, and this
court determines that such contention is well founded in all respects
and that no issue on the merits is, for such reasons, presentable to it,
is it proper to affirm the decree appealed from?
66
Question 2. If question 1 should be answered in the negative,
should the order of this court be a dismissal without prejudice?”
Where an appellant fails to file assignments of error as required
by the applicable rule (28 U. S. C. 862, 880; Rule No. 11 of the Rules
of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit), the appeal
may be dismissed. Compare Rules of this Court No. 9 and No. 27,
pars. 4, 5. But where an appeal is properly before the Court and,
upon hearing the appeal, the Court determines that such assignments
of error as have been duly filed have been abandoned, the Court may
affirm the decree from which the appeal is taken. Question No. 1
is answered in the affirmative. It is so ordered.
No. 91. Louise M. Hunt, a Femme Sole, Personally and as
Guardian of the Estate of Jack Russell Hunt and Sarah Ann Hunt,
Minors, petitioner, v. Western Casualty Company. On writ of cer-
tiorari to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit. Per curiam: While, under the applicable law of Texas, the
District Court was without authority in this suit to enforce an award
of the Industrial Accident Board to afford a trial de novo (Vestal v.
Texas Emp. Ins. Ass'n., 285 S. W. 1041; Texas Emp. Ins. Ass'n. v.
Neal, 11 S. W. (2d) 847; 14 S. W. (2d) 793), the question of the true
construction of the award was necessarily presented, and the decision
of the Circuit Court of Appeals in reviewing the judgment of the
District Court may be regarded as resting upon the determination of
that question. The writ of certiorari is dismissed as improvidently
granted.
No. 219. Abraham Posner, petitioner, v. Gustave Anderson, Indi-
vidually and as Administrator of the Estate of Mary Moran Ander-
son, etc. On writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the State
of New York. Per curiam: It appearing that petitioner is not a

party to the record, the writ of certiorari is dismissed as improvi-
dently granted.
No. 62. Frances Wetzel, appellant, v. Ira J. Fulton, Superin-
tendent of Banks of the State of Ohio, etc. Appeal from the Su-
preme Court of the State of Ohio. Per curiam: The appeal herein
is dismissed for the want of jurisdiction: (1) Lynch v. New York
ex rel. Pierson, 292 U. S. (decided November 5, 1934); (2)
Gibbes v. Zimmerman, 290 U. S. 326, 332.

No. 461. Martha Bright Farms, Inc., Everglade Farms, et al.,
appellants, v. Harry C. Davis, Bradford-Irving Corporation, et al.

granted, and the appeal is dismissed for the want of a substantial
Federal question. Milheim v. Moffat Tunnel District, 262 U. S. 710,
717-721; Rindge Co. v. Los Angeles, 262 U. S. 700, 705-708; Olcott v.

conduct unbecoming a member of the Bar of this Court in connec-
tion with litigation in the District Court of the United States for
the Eastern District of Virginia, it was, on October 8, 1934, ordered
that the complaint be held by this Court for the purpose of affording
opportunity to the complainant to present the subject of the com-
plaint for the consideration of the said District Court, and for the
further consideration of this Court in the light of whatever action

And it now appearing from a certified copy of an order of the

Virginia that the charges against Raymond M. Hudson, as a mem-
ber of the Bar of that Court, came on for hearing before the said
District Court, sitting at Alexandria, Virginia, on December 6,
1934, after written notice had been duly given to all parties in
interest, at which hearing, the said Edmond C. Fletcher failing
to appear in proper person or by counsel, the Court proceeded to
hear and determine said charges on the merits, and, being of opinion,
after fully hearing the testimony produced and considering the
said complaint and answer thereto, that the said charges were with-
out merit, ordered that the said complaint be, and it was, dismissed;

"The other orders of the Court appear upon the list certified to

No. In the Matter of Thomas Marshall.
It is ordered that Thomas Marshall, of Chicago, Illinois, show
cause on or before Monday, February 4, 1935, why he should not
be adjudged in contempt of this Court because of the character of
the statements contained in his briefs presented to this Court on
the application for certiorari in Marshall Electric Co. v. Pullman,
Inc. et al., No. 536 on the present docket, with particular reference
to the statements contained on pages 8 and 9 of the reply brief on
said application, as follows:
"The association of Blair and Dunne, Jr., still has the appearance
of a device and attempt to gain from a judge special personal con-
sideration and favor and nothing said in the reply of Respondents
in any way changes the situation.
"The 'odor' existing in this case was created by the acts of Blair
and his associates presumably to benefit their clients in this case.
Perhaps such methods can be shown in true perspective when it is
made manifest that for many years past Blair has daily engaged in
the practice of law in New York City without being licensed by
New York state so to do. Men who begin by fraud upon the courts
may be expected to continue such methods in daily practice. The
reply they have filed in this Court demonstrates their utter dis-
regard for truth and honor-and explains the level of which they
now complain."
and why he should not be punished accordingly.

et al., No. 536 on the present docket, as set forth in the order to
show cause;
And it now appearing that the said Thomas Marshall makes the
following answer:
"I am humiliated at the realization that certain remarks in my
reply brief have transgressed the bonds of propriety and offended
the Court. I am very sorry and apologize.
"The reply brief was written under pressure of time, and believe
me when I say that my failure to realize the impropriety of the
remarks in question was due solely to the heat of the controversy.
I own control by a substantial majority of the stock in the petitioner
and have personally had the active management of this litigation on
behalf of petitioner for a period of six years, through many courts";
The Court, upon consideration of his answer, finds and adjudges
that the offending statements contained in his briefs constitute con-
tempt of this Court, and now reprimands Thomas Marshall for the
use of the said statements, and as punishment therefor suspends him
from his rights and privileges as a member of the bar of this Court
for six months from this day and orders that he pay a fine of $250.

Present: The Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Van Devanter, Mr. Jus-
tive McReynolds, Mr. Justice Brandeis, Mr. Justice Sutherland, Mr.
Justice Butler, Mr. Justice Stone, Mr. Justice Roberts, and Mr.
Justice Cardozo.

The Chief Justice announced the following orders of the Court:
No. 70. Fred L. Fox, in his individual right and in his official
capacity as Tax Commissioner of the State of West Virginia, appel-
lant, v. Gulf Refining Company. Appeal from the District Court
of the United States for the Southern District of West Virginia.
Per curiam: Respondent brought this suit to restrain the enforce-
ment of the West Virginia Chain Store Act (Chapter 36, West Vir-
ginia Acts, 1933), upon the grounds (1) that gasoline filling stations
were not "stores" within the meaning of the Act; (2) that, if the
Act were interpreted to include such filling stations, it violated the
due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amend-
ment of the Constitution of the United States; and (3) that if the
foregoing questions were resolved against respondent, there were
certain filling stations, particularly described, which were not stores
"belonging to, operated or controlled " by respondent.
The District Court of three judges (28 U. S. C. 380) entered a
final decree permanently enjoining the enforcement of the Act, and
the case comes here on appeal. In so deciding, the District Court
sustained the first of the above-mentioned contentions of respondent,
and also the second contention with respect to the denial of the equal
protection of the laws, following its decision to the same effect in
Standard Oil Company v. Fox, 6 F. Supp. 494. That decision was
reversed by this Court. Fox v. Standard Oil Company, decided
87900-35-75

MONDAY, APRIL 8, 1935
186
January 14, 1935. The District Court did not determine the third
contention of respondent, as to its relation to certain gasoline sta-
tions, and that is the only question now sought to be presented to
this Court. The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded
to the District Court, composed as above stated, in order that it may
consider and decide that issue.
No. 788. General Construction Company, appellant, v. Earl L.
Fisher, Charles V. Galloway and John B. Carkin, Tax Commission-
ers of the State of Oregon et al. Appeal from the Supreme Court
of the State of Oregon. Per curiam: The appeal herein is dis-
missed for the want of a substantial federal question. Trinityfarm
Co. v. Grosjean, 291 U. S. 466, 472; Metcalf & Eddy, v. Mitchell,
269 U. S. 514; Lucas v. Howard, 280 U. S. 526; Lucas v. Reed, 281
U. S. 699; Alward v. Johnson, 282 U. S. 509, 514; Willcuts v. Bunn,

The Public Service Commission of West Virginia et al. In view of
the grounds stated on behalf of the appellee, The City of Wheeling,
in opposition to the appellant's motion to advance this cause, that
motion is denied. The provision of the order herein of April 1, 1935,
relating to the preparation of the case so that it may be advanced
and heard, at the date mentioned, is rescinded; otherwise the said
order shall remain in full force and effect.
No. 812. James B. O'Neal, petitioner, v. The State of California.

No. 816. E. J. Wilson, petitioner, v. G. C. Haynes. On petition

No moneys deposited as required by the Act shall be drawn
from the depository unless by check or warrant, signed by the
clerk of the court, or by a trustee, and countersigned by the judge
of the court, or by a referee designated for that purpose, or by the
clerk or his assistant under an order made by the judge, stating
the date, the sum, and the account for which it is drawn; and an
entry of the substance of such check or warrant, with the date
thereof, the sum drawn for, and the account for which it is drawn,

4. The commissions of the referee and of the custodian or re-

ruptcy, and the amount of the debts whose maturity is to be ex-
tended shall be included for that purpose as part of "the amount

liquidated under the provisions of subdivision (1) of section 74 of
the Act, the referee shall return to the estate any commissions pre-
viously received and shall be entitled to commissions on all moneys
disbursed to creditors by the trustee as provided in section 40 of

It is further ordered that the General Orders in Bankruptcy be,

1. The clerk of the district court in which proceedings under sec-
tion 77B are brought shall forthwith transmit to the Secretary of
the Treasury copies of (a) the petition of the corporation, or of the

the answer, if any, of the corporation in those cases in which an
involuntary proceeding is pending; (c) the order approving or dis-
missing the petition; (d) any order determining the time in which
the claims and interests of creditors may be filed or evidenced and

all orders extending the time in which such claims may be filed or
evidenced; (e) any order for a hearing issued upon the report of
the special master; (f) the plan of reorganization, amendments, or
modifications; (g) any order (1) fixing the time for confirming the
plan or dismissing the proceedings; (2) adjudging the corporation
to be solvent or insolvent; (3) confirming the plan or directing the
liquidation of the estate; (h) such other papers filed in the proceed-
ings as the Secretary of the Treasury may request of the clerk or the
court may direct him to transmit. The clerk shall also transmit to
the Collector of Internal Revenue for the district in which the pro-
ceedings are pending copies of the petition or answer above described
in subdivisions (a) and (b):

receipt of the petition or answer, shall ascertain that the United

whereupon the clerk may dispense with the transmittal of further
papers. All papers filed with the court shall have attached thereto
such copies as the clerk may require for carrying out this general
order.
2. Any order fixing the time for confirming any plan which deals
with the interests or claims of the United States shall include a
reasonable notice to the Secretary of the Treasury of at least thirty
days.
3. The provisions of this general order shall not apply to any
action heretofore taken; and failure to comply with any provision
