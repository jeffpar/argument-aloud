SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Present: Chief Justice Burger, Justice Brennan, Justice White, Jus-
tice Marshall, Justice Blackmun, Justice Powell, Justice Stevens, and
Justice O'Connor.
ORDER IN PENDING CASE
No. 85-5220. Jay Kelly Pinkerton, Petitioner v. O. L. McCotter,
Director, Texas Department of Corrections. The application for stay
of execution of the sentence of death scheduled for Thursday, August
15, 1985, presented to Justice White and by him referred to the Court is
granted pending the disposition by this Court of the petition for writ of
certiorari. Should the petition for a writ of certiorari be denied, this
stay terminates automatically. In the event the petition for writ of cer-
tiorari is granted, this stay shall continue pending the sending down of
the judgment of this Court. Justice Powell concurring in the granting
of the application for stay: Ordinarily, I would vote to deny the petition
for writ of certiorari and the application for stay as I find no substance
to any of petitioner's claims. But it is not clear from the votes of the
other Justices absent from Washington, whether there will be four
votes to grant the petition for writ of certiorari, and at this late hour
it has not been possible to clarify their positions. In view of this doubt,
I will vote to grant the stay. The Chief Justice and Justice White would
deny the application. Justice Rehnquist took no part in the consider-
ation or decision of this application.
