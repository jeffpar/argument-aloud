SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES.

Present: Mr. Justice McKenna, Mr. Justice Holmes, Mr. Justice
Day, Mr. Justice Van Devanter, Mr. Justice Pitney, Mr. Justice
McReynolds, Mr. Justice Brandeis, and Mr. Justice Clarke.
Mr. Justice McKenna said:
"GENTLEMEN OF THE BAR: This empty chair, and the sombre
drapery upon it, announce that since the last sitting of the Court a
grievous affliction has come to the country, and to us, an affliction
which to some of us and, it may be, to all of us, can never have com-
plete solace. A great life has ceased to exist, one replete with
achievements achievements in many fields of endeavor, all typical
and demonstrative of ability and merit, of which, to adopt the words
of another, 'it would be difficult to say anything that would trans-
cend the bounds of a just and decorous eulogy.' Eulogy, however,
will be the purpose and appointment of another time, and of other
lips than mine. To mine now is the humbler and sadder deputation
to express the sorrow of my brethren and myself at the death of our
Chief Justice. But, expressing a more poignant and personal sor-
row, may I not say, at the death of our associate in duties, our com-
panion in council, our friend and intimate. He was all of these to
us, and by them animated and directed our work; his precedence
veiled under a considerate courtesy, our intercourse with him made
a real enjoyment. I use the word 'enjoyment' because I speak in
retrospection-speak of a time upon which sorrow had not cast its
shadow.
"I hope I shall be pardoned these personal considerations. I do not
overlook or underestimate the greater abilities that attracted the
Nation's commendation in his life, and has caused the Nation's sor-
row in his death-a sorrow in which we participate. But his facul-
ties need not be distinguished; they were comprehensive in their
action, had connection and purpose, were as manifest in private life
as in official life.
"In private life he was a gentleman in the best sense of that much-
abused word. He was considerately kind and courteous, and not in
passing show for he was incapable of artifice or dissimulation.

"In official life he had a high and earnest sense of duty, and duty
to a judge has a special incentive, its object is justice and justice to
the fullness of its definition: 'The constant and perpetual wish to
render to every man his rights.' This wish was ever in the Chief
Justice's mind-its insistent motive and animation. And in this
duty to the individual serious questions came-questions of the
validity of laws and executive acts, and the ordination of the powers
of the United States and the States, granted or reserved to them, re-
spectively, by the Constitution. To the questions thus presented the
Chief Justice directed a consideration proportioned to their imme-
diate and ultimate effect, the public welfare depending upon them.
He realized, as all of us must realize, that the necessity of passing
upon them marks the place and power of the Federal judiciary in
our scheme of government-the condition, it may be, of its stability
and permanence, preserving always the splendid conception of the
Constitution-one sovereignty constituted of many-it being su-
preme within the sphere of its powers; they being supreme within
the sphere of their powers, resulting in Governments, National, and
State, competent to encounter and resolve the problems incident to
or emergent in the lives and affairs of a people.
"This is of the past in barest outline-What of the future? An-
ticipating it, I see no shadow on his fame, no lessening of his ex-
ample nor of the impression his life and services have made upon
the country. I venture comparisons. I make full concession of the
recognized and illustrious merit of those who have preceded him.
I make full admission, in assured prophecy, of the abilities of those
who will succeed him, yet, considering his qualities and their exer-
cises, I dare to say that, as he has attained, he will forever keep, a
distinct eminence among the Chief Justices of the United States.
"In testimony of his worth, in tribute and respect to his memory,
the court will adjourn until to-morrow at 12 o'clock."
Adjourned until to-morrow at 12 o'clock.

Mr. Justice McKenna said:
"GENTLEMEN OF THE BAR: It is my sad office to announce that
another sorrow has come to the Court in the death of Mr. James D.
Maher, its clerk-a sorrow following close upon that of which this

264
empty chair is testimony-a sorrow having particular emphasis,
and we are impelled to its expression and manifestation.
"Our association with him was personal and official. Where
personal, he exhibited an attractive courtesy; where official, he.
impressed a sense of ability and that trust could be reposed in him.
"His connection with the Court began over a half a century
ago-to be exact, in 1865, as a page, and from that humble begin-
ning he rose successively to be junior clerk, deputy clerk, and
clerk. By this advancement his ability was availed of as much as
rewarded, and it was justified to the last moment of his service--
service ending only with his life.
"What more need be said? The successive promotions proclaim
his merit; verbal enunciation or eulogy of it is an unnecessary sup-
plement. I, however, venture some particulars. Among other
powers he had the power of taking pains, and that in high degree.
It was a constituent of his efficiency which gave an assurance of
exactness and confident reliance upon whatever he did or was to do.
"And he thought nothing a trouble; he was prompt, therefore, to
grant any request or obey any direction, heightening thereby his
courtesy or duty. In this I am repeating the appreciation of our
Chief Justice, who in greater degree than the rest of us, had occa-
sion to demand or receive the aid of Mr. Maher, and could make,
therefore, an exact estimate of him and his services. And, of course,
his exact and comprehensive knowledge of the procedural precedents
and practices of the court was of inestimable service to the members
of the bar, and he was always ready to render that service.
"One other word in summary of his merit and our appreciation
of it: In private life he was as exact to fulfill his duties and obliga-
tions as he was in official life, and his example and services will
remain with us a cherished and intimate memory; to those who suc-
ceed us they will be an instructive tradition."
No. 5. The United States, appellant, v. American Can Company
et al. Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the
District of Maryland. Dismissed, on motion of Mr. Solicitor Gen-
eral Frierson for the appellant.
No. 29, original. Ex parte in the matter of Lincoln Gas & Elec-
tric Light Company, petitioner. Leave granted to present petition
for rehearing within 60 days, on motion of Mr. C. B. Ellis in that
behalf.
Order. The reporter having represented that owing to the number
of decisions at the present term it would be impracticable to put the

265
reports in one volume, it is, therefore, now here ordered that he
publish an additional volume in this year pursuant to section 226
of the Judicial Code, approved March 3, 1911.
Order. It is now here ordered by the Court that all the cases on
the docket not decided and all the other business of the term not
disposed of be, and the same are hereby, continued to the next term.
Adjourned to the time and place appointed by law.
