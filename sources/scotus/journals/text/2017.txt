  No. 16–658. Charmaine Hamer, Petitioner v. Neighborhood Housing

  Adjourned until Wednesday, October 11, 2017, at 10 o’clock.


                Certiorari—Summary Disposition
   No. 16–1436. Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, et al.,
Petitioners v. International Refugee Assistance, et al. We granted cer-
tiorari in this case to resolve a challenge to “the temporary suspension
of entry of aliens abroad under Section 2(c) of Executive Order No.
13,780.” Because that provision of the Order “expired by its own
terms” on September 24, 2017, the appeal no longer presents a “live
case or controversy.” Burke v. Barnes, 479 U. S. 361, 363 (1987). Follow-
ing our established practice in such cases, the judgment is therefore
vacated, and the case is remanded to the United States Court of Ap-
peals for the Fourth Circuit with instructions to dismiss as moot the
challenge to Executive Order No. 13,780. United States v. Munsing­
wear, Inc., 340 U. S. 36, 39 (1950). We express no view on the merits.
   Justice Sotomayor dissents from the order vacating the judgment
below And would dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently
granted.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

   Present: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Kennedy, Justice Thomas,
Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, Justice Alito, Justice Sotomayor, Jus-
tice Kagan, and Justice Gorsuch.

                      Order in Pending Case
   No. 17A440. Jefferson S. Dunn, Commissioner, Alabama Department
of Corrections, et al., Applicants v. Torrey Twane McNabb. Application
to vacate the injunction entered by the United States District Court
for the Middle District of Alabama on October 16, 2017, presented to
Justice Thomas and by him referred to the Court, is granted. “[I]n-
mates seeking time to challenge the manner in which the State plans to
execute them must satisfy all of the requirements for a stay, including
a showing of a signiﬁcant possibility of success on the merits.” Hill v.
McDonough, 547 U. S. 573, 584 (2006). The All Writs Act does not ex-
cuse a court from making these ﬁndings. Because the District Court
enjoined respondent’s execution without ﬁnding that he has a signiﬁ-
cant possibility of success on the merits, it abused its discretion. We
accordingly vacate the injunction.
   Justice Breyer and Justice Sotomayor would deny the application to
vacate the injunction.


                         Certiorari Denied
  No. 17–6400. Torrey Twane McNabb, Petitioner v. Jefferson S. Dunn,
Commissioner, Alabama Department of Corrections, et al. Petition for
writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Elev-
enth Circuit denied.


                      Order in Pending Case
  No. 17A437. Torrey Twane McNabb, Applicant v. Jefferson S. Dunn,
Commissioner, Alabama Department of Corrections, et al. Application
for stay of execution of sentence of death presented to Justice Thomas
and by him referred to the Court denied. The order heretofore entered
by Justice Thomas is vacated.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

   Present: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Kennedy, Justice Thomas,
Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, Justice Alito, Justice Sotomayor, Jus-
tice Kagan, and Justice Gorsuch.

                Certiorari—Summary Disposition
   No. 16–1540. Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, et al.,
Petitioners v. Hawaii, et al. We granted certiorari in this case to re-
solve a challenge to the temporary suspension of entry of aliens and
refugees under Section 2(c) and Section 6 of Executive Order No.
13,780. Because those provisions of the Order have “expired by [their]
own terms,” the appeal no longer presents a “live case or controversy.”
Burke v. Barnes, 479 U. S. 361, 363 (1987). Following our established
practice in such cases, the judgment is therefore vacated, and the case
is remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-
cuit with instructions to dismiss as moot the challenge to Executive
Order No. 13,780. United States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U. S. 36, 39
(1950). We express no view on the merits.
   Justice Sotomayor dissents from the order vacating the judgment
below and would dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently
granted.

                       Order in Pending Case

   No. 17A550. Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, et al.,
Applicants v. Hawaii, et al. The application for a stay presented to
Justice Kennedy and by him referred to the Court is granted, and the
District Court’s October 20, 2017 order granting a preliminary injunc-
tion is stayed pending disposition of the Government’s appeal in the
United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and disposition
of the Government’s petition for a writ of certiorari, if such writ is
sought. If a writ of certiorari is sought and the Court denies the peti-
tion, this order shall terminate automatically. If the Court grants the
petition for a writ of certiorari, this order shall terminate when the
Court enters its judgment.
   In light of its decision to consider the case on an expedited basis, we
expect that the Court of Appeals will render its decision with appro-
priate dispatch.
   Justice Ginsburg and Justice Sotomayor would deny the application.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

  Present: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Kennedy, Justice Thomas,
Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, Justice Alito, Justice Sotomayor,
Justice Kagan, and Justice Gorsuch.

                      Order in Pending Case
  No. 18A65. United States, et al., Applicants v. United States District
Court for the District of Oregon.
  The application for stay presented to Justice Kennedy and by him
referred to the Court denied.
  The Government’s request for relief is premature and is denied with­
out prejudice. The breadth of respondents’ claims is striking, however,
and the justiciability of those claims presents substantial grounds for
difference of opinion. The District Court should take these concerns
into account in assessing the burdens of discovery and trial, as well
as the desirability of a prompt ruling on the Government’s pending
dispositive motions.
