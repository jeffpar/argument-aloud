  No. 13A594. Don Roper, Warden, Applicant v. Allen L. Nicklasson.
Application to vacate the stay of execution of sentence of death entered
by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit on De­
cember 9, 2013, presented to Justice Alito and by him referred to the
Court granted. Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Breyer, Justice
Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan join, dissenting. I would deny the appli­
cation to vacate the stay of execution entered by the Court of Appeals.
See Bowersox v. Williams, 517 U. S. 345, 347 (1996) (Ginsburg, J., dis­
senting). (“At the very least, before acting irretrievably, this Court
might have invited prompt clariﬁcation of the Court of Appeals’ [stay]
order. Appreciation of our own fallibility, and respect for the judgment
of an appellate tribunal closer to the scene than we are, as I see it,
demand as much.”)

   The Chief Justice said:
   “I am authorized to announce that the Court has acted upon all cases
submitted to the Court for decision this Term. Disposition of items
scheduled for conference today will be reﬂected on an Order List that
will be released at 9:30 tomorrow morning.”
   “The Court will be in recess from today until the ﬁrst Monday in
October 2014, at which time the October 2013 Term of the Court will
be adjourned and the October 2014 Term of the Court will begin, as
provided by law.”
   “On behalf of my colleagues, I would like to thank the Supreme
Court employees for their outstanding work and dedication to their
important responsibilities during this Term. The commitment and pro­
fessionalism of all Court staff contribute signiﬁcantly to the accom­
plishment of the Court’s mission. The Court also thanks the members
of the Court’s Bar for their professionalism and cooperation.”
   “Now before we rise for the summer, I would like to take the oppor­
tunity to note a number of retirements: Wilma Grant, Manager of the
Publications Unit retired in April, but is here today. She served her
adopted country at the Court for 34 years. We are grateful for her
crucial contributions in overseeing the publication of our decisions.
Sarah Miller, a building support technician in our Marshal’s ofﬁce is
leaving the Court on July 31st after 25 years of Supreme Court service.
She spent each of those years working the night shift. My colleagues
and I appreciate her hard work and tireless devotion to the Court. Toni
Singleton, Secretary in the Reporter of Decisions ofﬁce has announced
her retirement, effective September 1st of this year after 37 years of
Government service, 31 of them at the Court. We commend her many
valuable contributions to the work of the Reporter’s ofﬁce.
   “Finally, Chris Vasil, Chief Deputy Clerk, will also be leaving us
before we reconvene in the fall. He will retire on September 1st with
38 years of Government service, 32 at the Court. Mr. Vasil has per­
formed the vital role of assisting both the Bench and the Bar in the
management of our docket, and in navigating the nuances of our Rules,
Practices, and Customs. He has done so with grace, good judgment,
and distinction. The Court thanks these employees for their dedicated
public service to the Court and Country. We wish them well in their
retirement.”


  Adjourned until Monday, October 6, 2014, at 10 o’clock.
