SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

  Present: Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice O’Connor, Justice Scalia,
Justice Kennedy, Justice Souter, Justice Thomas, Justice Ginsburg, and
Justice Breyer.
  The Chief Justice said:
  “As we open this morning, I announce with sadness that our friend
and colleague Warren Earl Burger, former Chief Justice of this Court,
died yesterday in the early morning, at Sibley Hospital in Washing-
ton, D.C.
  “He was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1907. He was a self-made
man. Not having the finances to attend college full time he sold insur-
ance during the day to pay his way through night school. He spent two
years at the University of Minnesota and then graduated with honors
four years later from the Mitchell College of Law, formerly the St. Paul
College of Law.
  “His remarkable professional career began with a long tenure at a
private firm in St. Paul where he specialized in civil and administrative
practice. While in private practice, he made time to be an adjunct pro-
fessor of contracts and actively participated in local civic and political
organizations. In 1953, President Eisenhower appointed him to the De-
partment of Justice as an Assistant Attorney General in charge of the
Civil Division. A few years later, he was nominated to the United
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where he
served for 13 years until his appointment as Chief Justice of the United
States by President Nixon in 1969.
  “He served as Chief Justice for 17 years and will long be remem-
bered as a major contributor to the decisional law of this Court. He
was also an innovative reformer of the administration of justice. As
appellate judge he had helped establish the Appellate Judges’ Seminar
at New York University and later cochaired an eight-year study for
the ABA on standards of criminal justice. As Chief Justice, he reduced
the time for oral arguments in our own Court from two hours to one
hour, he introduced modern technology to the processing of opinions,

    “Following his retirement as Chief Justice in 1986, he continued his
commitment to public service and devoted large amounts of his time to
the Chairing of the Commission on the Bicentennial of the United

energy and warmth, and I speak for all of them in expressing our
profound sympathy to his son Wade, his daughter Margaret Mary, his
grandchildren, and to all those whose lives were touched by this re-
markable man and his wife Vera, who died last year. The recess the
Court takes today will be in his memory. At an appropriate time, the
traditional memorial observance of the Court and Bar of the Court will
be held in this Courtroom.”
    “Today’s orders of the Court have been certified by The Chief Jus-
tice, filed with the Clerk, and will not be announced orally.”
