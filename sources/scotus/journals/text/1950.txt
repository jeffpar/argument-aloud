No. 8, Original. The State of Kansas, complainant, v. The State of

parties in this case to amend the decree of this Court (322 U. S. 654),
it is ordered that the joint motion be, and it is hereby, granted and
the decree is amended to read as follows:
"This cause was argued by counsel at the October Term, 1943, upon
the pleadings and exceptions to the Report of the Special Master. On
June 5, 1944, this Court entered a decree establishing a boundary
between the States. Since the entry of the decree the States of Kansas
and Missouri through their legislatures have agreed upon a boundary
and such agreement has been ratified by joint resolution of the Con-
gress of the United States and the resolution approved by the Presi-
dent of the United States. Public Law 637, approved August 3, 1950.
Therefore, in order to conform this Court's decree to the agreement
of the parties as ratified by the Congress of the United States,
"It is Ordered, Adjudged, and Decreed that the boundary line
between the States of Kansas and Missouri, which extends from the
intersection of the Missouri River with the 40th parallel, north lati-
tude, southward to the middle of the mouth of the Kaw or Kansas
River, be and it is hereby established as the middle line of the main
navigable channel of the Missouri River as said river flows through-
out its entire course from its intersection with the 40th parallel, north
latitude, southward to the middle of the mouth of the Kaw or Kansas
River, subject only to changes which may occur by the natural proc-
esses of accretion and reliction, but not by avulsion.
"The costs of this suit are equally divided between the two States,
Complainant and Defendant."

No. 372. Vivian E. Simpson, Secretary of State of Maryland, peti-

Court of Appeals of Maryland.
No. 371 is a motion to advance and expedite the hearing of an
appeal from a decision of the Court of Appeals of the State of Mary-
land affirming the denial of a petition for writ of mandamus.
Appellant, petitioner below, was nominated by the Progressive Party
for Governor of Maryland at a convention held on August 7, 1950.
On August 18, nine days before the last date permitted by law, he
tendered a certificate of nomination to the Secretary of State, a pre-
requisite to appearing on the ballot for the election on November 7.

MONDAY, OCTOBER 23, 1950
49
On the same day, August 18, the tender was rejected for failure to file
an affidavit required by the Maryland Subversive Activities Act of
1949. On September 14, petitioner obtained from the Circuit Court of
Anne Arundel County an order to show cause why a writ of mandamus
should not be issued to compel the Secretary of State to accept the
certificate. The Secretary, on September 27, demurred to the petition;
and on October 9, after a hearing, the court sustained the demurrer and
dismissed the petition. On appeal to the Maryland Court of Appeals
argument was heard on October 12. That Court entered a per curiam
order, two judges dissenting, the same day, affirming the judgment
against the petitioner and, obviously deeming an exposition of the
statute necessary, stated that an opinion would thereafter be filed.
On October 18 petitioner filed an appeal from this order. In this
situation the motion to advance and expedite is denied.
The Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Black and Mr. Justice Douglas, dis-
senting in No. 371:
The order denying the motion to advance and expedite No. 371 in
all probability deprives this appellant of an opportunity to have a
final decision on the grave constitutional questions which he presents.
This means that before the Court can consider the case in the course
of ordinary procedure, the election in which he desires to run for
Governor will undoubtedly have been held and the controversy thus
rendered moot. We cannot agree to deny appellant a hearing in this
manner.
The nature of typical election laws is such that only a limited time
is available for judicial review. This fact has presented difficulties
in this Court before, see Colegrove v. Green, 328 U. S. 549, 565;
MacDougall v. Green, 335 U. S. 281, 285; Cook v. Fortson, Turman
v. Duckworth, 329 U. S. 675, 677, and generally advancement has had
to be requested in cases of this nature. MacDougall v. Green, supra;
Cook v. Fortson, Turman v. Duckworth, supra; South v. Peters, 339
U. S. 276. Where, as here, a justiciable controversy and substantial
federal questions coexist, the court can and should advance a deter-
mination of the case. There is no showing of lack of diligence on
appellant's part. Under the present circumstances the absence of an
opinion by the Maryland Court of Appeals is no reason for refusing
consideration here. Whatever the Maryland court may later say,
appellant has been deprived of his opportunity to become a candidate
in the election.
No. 372 is a petition for writ of certiorari from the same order of
the Court of Appeals insofar as it reversed the dismissal by the Circuit
Court of the petition for writ of mandamus brought by a Progressive
Party nominee for the United States House of Representatives. The
petition is denied.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Present: Mr. Chief Justice Vinson, Mr. Justice Black, Mr. Justice
Reed, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, Mr. Justice Douglas, Mr. Justice Jack-
son, Mr. Justice Burton, Mr. Justice Clark, and Mr. Justice Minton.
Mr. Solicitor General Perlman addressed the Court as follows:
"May it please the Court: At a meeting of members of the Bar of
the Supreme Court, held this morning, resolutions expressing their
profound sorrow at the death of Justice Frank Murphy were offered
by a committee, of which the Honorable Benjamin V. Cohen was
chairman. Addresses were made to the Bar by Edward G. Kemp,
Esquire, who was closely associated with the late Justice through most
of his career, Judge Charles Fahy of the United States Court of Ap-
peals for the District of Columbia, and Thurgood Marshall, Chief
Counsel of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People. The resolutions, adopted unanimously, are as follows:
"RESOLUTIONS
"We of the Bar of the Supreme Court of the United States are
gathered here to commemorate the life and works of Mr. Justice
Murphy, whose untimely death occurred in Detroit, Michigan, on
July 19, 1949. The brief words of tribute uttered today can give but
inadequate expression to the great qualities of his mind and heart. His
life was indeed an abundant one, dedicated to the noblest and highest
traditions of our civilization. In every step of his varied career of
public service, he exhibited a passionate and selfless regard for the
rights of his fellow men. We do well, therefore, to reflect upon the
life of one who has enriched the history of the Court and of the nation.
"Frank Murphy was born in the village of Sand Beach, now the
city of Harbor Beach, Michigan, on April 13, 1890, the third of four
children of John F. and Mary Brennan Murphy. The father was re-
spected as an able lawyer and as a public-spirited citizen in Huron
County; he served two terms as prosecuting attorney and achieved
notable success in jury cases as a private practitioner. He was also
the leading Democrat in an overwhelmingly Republican community.
From him the young Frank acquired an interest in law and politics, a
rugged spirit of independence and a capacity for leadership. The
spirituality and gentleness of the mother were of the rarest quality
and it was she who endowed Frank Murphy with his deep religious
conscience. The Bible which she gave him when he was graduated
from high school he carried with him to his dying day and upon it
he took the oaths of the high offices which he attained. His parents,
devout Catholics of Irish stock, inculcated in Frank Murphy not only
908025-51-48

TUESDAY, MARCH 6, 1951
141
deep faith in his religion and genuine pride in his ancestry, but an
unusual sense of security regarding his religion and ancestry. He
never felt that his own religion could be hurt by the peaceful rivalry
of other faiths. Nor did he think that he could add a cubit to his own
pride of ancestry by disparaging that of others. From his parents he
learned at an early age that true self-respect involves an abiding re-
spect and tolerance for the rights of others, a principle that was to
have a profound influence upon his political as well as his judicial
work.
"The early education of Justice Murphy was acquired in the pub-
lic schools of Harbor Beach. There he demonstrated his natural
talents as a student, an orator, an athlete, and a leader of his fellows.
These talents he carried with him to the University of Michigan, where
he pursued his undergraduate studies and received a Bachelor of Laws
degree in 1914.
"Following his admission to the Michigan Bar in 1914, he began
work as a law clerk with the Detroit firm of Monaghan & Monaghan
and he quickly received recognition as a promising trial lawyer. Dur-
ing his first years at the Bar he also taught at the Detroit College of
Law.
"Soon after the entry of the United States into World War I,
Justice Murphy sought active service in the Army where he served
as a first lieutenant and later as a captain in the Fourth and Eighty-
fifth Infantry Divisions. After the Armistice he served with the
occupation army in the German Rhineland. Upon his discharge from
the service, he continued his legal studies at Lincoln's Inn, London,
and Trinity College, Dublin. In Ireland the growth and vitality of
the movement for independence enlisted his keen and sympathetic
interest, and his understanding of that movement was to be of in-
valuable assistance to him in later years in his work with the leaders
of the Philippine movement for independence.
"He returned to the United States in 1919 and became Chief Assist-
ant in the office of the United States District Attorney in Detroit. It
is said that in this capacity he lost practically no cases among the
many in which he participated. Notable was his work in obtaining
convictions for graft and fraud against the Government on large war
contracts. He also assisted the Government in the successful prosecu-
tion of the condemnation proceedings resulting in the widening of the
River Rouge and which in later years made possible the development
of the vast River Rouge plant of the Ford Motor Company.
"It was in the election of 1920 that he made his first and unsuc-
cessful bid for public office, the office of Congressman from the First
District of Michigan. A Wilsonian Democrat, he was defeated in the
Republican landslide. After his service in the District Attorney's
office, a brief interlude of private law practice in Detroit ensued.
"In 1923, in a spirited campaign, he was elected to the Recorder's
Court, a criminal court of Detroit. Judge Murphy took an active
interest in the administrative affairs of the court. He helped to make
the psychopathic clinic and probation department indispensable,
nonpolitical adjuncts of the court.

TUESDAY, MARCH 6, 1951

"The most noteworthy trial that he presided over was the Sweet
murder case growing out of bitter racial tensions. Dr. Sweet, a Negro,
had established his home in a neighborhood previously reserved for
whites. A threatening mob gathered near his home, frightening him
and other Negroes with him. Shots were fired. A white man was
killed. Dr. Sweet and several other Negroes were indicted for murder.
Public feeling was inflamed against them. To administer justice in
these circumstances required more than a mere crusader's zeal; it
required more than book-learning. It required courage, human under-
standing, dignity, and a grasp of the essential principles of criminal
procedure. At the trial young Judge Murphy showed that he possessed
all these qualities in good measure. It is important to recall not only
that the trial resulted in the acquittal of the defendants in face of
public clamor, but that the community, despite its original hostility,
was convinced that the trial was fairly conducted from the standpoint
of the community as well as the defendants. Clarence Darrow, counsel
for the defendants, later remarked that Murphy was 'a judge who
not only seemed human, but
proved to be the kindliest and
most understanding man I have ever happened to meet on the bench.'
"In 1929, he was reelected to the Recorder's Court. A year later
he resigned to become the successful candidate for the office of Mayor
of Detroit. As chief executive of a great industrial city struck by the
full force of unemployment and depression he recognized the import-
ance of making all citizens conscious of their interest in the continued
maintenance of the orderly processes of government. His bold ad-
vocacy of the principle of government responsibility for the destitute
attracted Nation-wide attention. At the same time, however, he
pursued a program of rigid economy in other services of the city gov-
ernment. He succeeded in fulfilling his campaign pledge that 'not one
deserving man or woman shall go hungry in Detroit because of circum-
stances beyond his control.' Public appreciation of his efforts was
demonstrated in 1931 by his reelection as Mayor.

"In 1933 he was appointed by President Roosevelt to the post of
Governor General of the Philippines. He quickly gained the con-
fidence of the Filipino people and their leaders. Because he believed
in them and in their right to freedom, they believed in him and eagerly
sought his counsel long after he had left the Philippines. With the
inauguration of the Commonwealth Government in 1935 he became
the first United States High Commissioner of the Philippines. Dur-
ing his three years of service in the Philippines he was instrumental
in placing the fiscal affairs of the government in good order and insti-
tuted several needed social reforms, including the modern probation
system and public health services.
"Frank Murphy returned home in 1936 to become the successful
candidate for Governor of the State of Michigan. He assumed office
on January 1, 1937, and was immediately confronted with the grave
problems arising out of the historic sit-down strike then in progress
at the Flint plant of the General Motors Corporation. His insistence
that peaceful methods be exhausted before resort to force made him the
center of Nation-wide attention and controversy. Some thought that
he was condoning the flouting of the law, yet he never attempted to

TUESDAY, MARCH 6, 1951
143
justify or condone the sit-down strike. He delayed sending troops
into the plant when the strikers refused to obey a court order so that
a peaceful settlement could be obtained which would avoid the use of
force that he feared would result in bloodshed and resentment rather
than respect for law. He continuously sought to convince the strike
leaders that it was their duty to obey the law and within a few days
a peaceful settlement was obtained.
"Frank Murphy was profoundly convinced that collective bargain-
ing and the settlement of labor disputes through direct negotiation
of employer and employee representatives were fundamental prereq-
uisites to our ultimate industrial and economic welfare, and even to
the preservation of our system of government. In the bitter dispute at
Flint, and in those which followed, he saw a serious threat to these
objectives. Men may differ as to the wisdom and propriety of his
patient restraint. But both management and labor now testify that
Governor Murphy's humane action prevented bloodshed. And it seems
fair to say that by avoiding the use of force he strengthened the proc-
esses of peaceful settlement of industrial disputes.
"During his term as Governor many reforms were accomplished-
among these a civil-service law, an occupational-disease law, a mod-
ernized corrections system, a mental hygiene program, a modernized
central accounting system, and an expanded old-age assistance pro-
gram. He also initiated studies with a view to the modernization of
the State government, the reorganization of the tax structure, and
the stabilization of the milk industry.
"He was defeated_for reelection in 1938 but his great talents did
not lie fallow. On January 1, 1939, President Roosevelt announced
his appointment as Attorney General of the United States. Impressed
by the growing threat of totalitarianism to our free world he had hoped
to be given a position in which he could take an active part in building
up our armed strength, but like a good soldier he accepted the post to
which he was assigned. During the year that he served as the
Nation's chief law officer he accomplished much of more than transient
importance and value. Notable appointments to the Federal bench
were made on his recommendation. He proceeded firmly against
corruption in the judiciary and other high public offices. He set up a
committee on Administrative Law under the Chairmanship of Dean
Acheson whose work has had a great effect on the development of ad-
ministrative law and practice. He also set up a committee on the
administration of the Bankruptcy Act under the Chairmanship of
Francis M. Shea and its recommendations led to important changes
and improvements in the administration of insolvent estates in the
Federal courts. A Civil Rights Section was established in the Crimi-
nal Division of the Department to encourage more vigorous use of the
civil rights statutes and to centralize responsibility for their enforce-
ment; in 1947 the President's Committee on Civil Rights stated that
'the total achievement of the Department of Justice in the civil rights
field during the Section's existence goes well beyond anything that had
previously been accomplished.'
"Attorney General Murphy was nominated to be Associate Justice
of the Supreme Court by President Roosevelt on January 4, 1940, and

TUESDAY, MARCH 6, 1951
144
he took his seat on the Court on February 5, 1940 (309 U. S. III).
"Frank Murphy thus brought to the Supreme Court uniquely signi-
ficant talents and experiences. He brought to it a thorough and practi-
cal understanding of the interests and longings of masses of men and
women in a highly mechanized society, an alert sensitiveness to the
individual rights of a free people, an exceptional comprehension of
the respective roles of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches
of our Government, an acute awareness of the social and economic
wrongs, and a determination to translate our constitutional and legal
ideals into judicial reality.
"Justice Murphy's labors on the Supreme Court bore rich fruit.
In the decade of his association with the Court, he made a contribu-
tion that will forever be enshrined in the hearts of those devoted to
the preservation and advancement of individual liberties. Time and
again he spoke eloquently on behalf of the constitutional and legal
rights of the accused, the unpopular, and the oppressed. Sometimes
he spoke on behalf of the Court, sometimes for a minority of the
Court, and not infrequently he spoke alone. But always he reflected
a humane and an understanding sense of justice.
"His forthright and eloquent defense of the rights of nonconform-
ing individuals and groups, and his burning condemnation of racism,
long will cheer and inspire defenders of freedom in a troubled world.
His ability to rise above the popular passions of the moment to affirm
the eternal virtues of freedom despite the transient emotions engen-
dered by crisis and war will long stand as an example of judicial
fearlessness.
"At the same time, the Justice was more than a humanitarian in his
judicial labors. He was a hard-headed realist, a courageous fighter
for his beliefs in all matters of judicial importance. And he helped
to shape significant developments in the fields of constitutional law,
labor law, administrative law, Federal-State relationships, and in
numerous other aspects of the Court's jurisdiction. But he will proba-
bly be remembered, as he would probably want to be remembered, for
his defense of human rights and freedoms under the Constitution.
While he recognized the limited role of the judiciary in a democratic
society, he believed and acted vigorously and constantly on the belief
that the protection of the fundamental rights of the individual to
freedom of thought, speech, and religion was essential to the preserva-
tion of democracy. He was concerned to protect the individual from
the abuse of both political and economic power.
"It is accordingly resolved that we express our deep sorrow at
the untimely death of Mr. Justice Murphy and our grateful recog-
nition of the enduring contribution made by him to the humanizing of
the law, to the vindication of human rights, and to the preservation
of the ideal of freedom.
"It is further resolved that the Attorney General be asked to pre-
sent these resolutions to the Court and to request that they be per-
manently inscribed upon its record."
Mr. Attorney General McGrath addressed the Court as follows:
"May it please the Court: The Resolutions which have just been
read, and the addresses which were delivered earlier this morning

before the Bar of this Court, have described how the late Justice
Frank Murphy devoted almost his entire adult life to a most dis-
tinguished career of public service. That career is one to which
fruitful consideration will be devoted at far greater length than is
possible in these proceedings. I speak with personal knowledge, as
it was my great privilege to have close associations with him during
the major part of his public service. I came to know and value him
when he was the Mayor of Detroit, and our friendship continued when
he was Governor of Michigan and when he was Governor General
of the Philippines. I was United States Attorney for the District
of Rhode Island during the period when Justice Murphy was At-
torney General of the United States, and, being an officer of the
Justice Department, of which the Attorney General is the head, our
duties brought us into frequent contact. After Justice Murphy be-
came a member of this Court I appeared here as Solicitor General of
the United States.
"So it is that I am here, not only to pay a deserved tribute to a
predecessor in the office I now hold, but also to speak of one who
was my own chief in the Department of Justice, and who was my
personal friend over a long period of years. It is, I believe, rare,
indeed, that one who takes part in such ceremonies in an official
capacity is privileged to bring to the occasion such an intimate and
personal knowledge as I do of the departed Justice in whose memory
we are gathered here today.
"Justice Murphy was not one of those who thought that the only
necessary or proper support for judicial action was a carefully con-
structed edifice of precedent. He by no means ignored the past; he
accorded it all the respect that he felt was its due. But his realistic
humanitarianism convinced him that the problems of today must be
handled in a manner that will resolve them practically. He found
abhorrent and incomprehensible the idea that old forms, which might
indeed have contributed effectively to the attainment of justice in the
past, should be permitted to govern in current cases where their opera-
tion seemed to him to result only in injustice. "The law knows no
finer hour,' he wrote in his dissent in the Falbo case,¹ 'than when it cuts
through formal concepts and transitory emotions to protect unpopular
citizens against discrimination and persecution.' Similarly, in his
concurring opinion in the Hooven & Allison Co. case, wherein this
Court held that imports from the Philippine Islands were protected
against taxation by the States during the period immediately preced-
ing the attainment of Philippine independence, Justice Murphy sup-
ported this view as 'compelled in good measure by practical consid-
erations,' as well as by the 'moral and legal obligations' of the United
States to those Islands. Like many great judges of the law before
him, Justice Murphy subordinated strict precedent to an altogether
human ideal of justice. His was an instinct which is most intimately
intertwined with our basic national ideals. And I am profoundly
convinced that his decisions were motivated throughout by a deep
awareness of those ideals, with an ungrudging and unquestioning dis-
1 Falbo v. U. S., 320 U. S. 549, 561 (1944).

regard of any personal preferences of his own that might have stood
against what he felt to be required by our national principles.
"An outstanding instance of this appears in his actions in the var-
ious cases concerning the religious sect called Jehovah's Witnesses,
members of which were involved in cases before this Court almost
constantly during Justice Murphy's tenure. Another instance is his
insistence that constitutional protection be accorded communists.³ A
devout Roman Catholic, he disregarded personal preferences which
we all know were very dear to him in favor of what his conscience
told him to be his duty as a Justice of this Court. His views on the
freedoms of religion and of communication were thorough. He con-
sistently believed that their enjoyment should be guaranteed to all
persons in whatever manner indulged in except when, as in the
Chaplinsky case, the conduct in question was so deeply offensive to
other principles vital to our society that the claim to freedom as an
exercise of religion could not be tolerated. Thus, for instance, the
late Justice wrote in his opinion for the Court in Hartzel v. U. S.,5
that:
66 6* * *
4
an American citizen has the right to discuss these
matters either by temperate reasoning or by immoderate and
vicious invective * * * '
"Justice Murphy was humanitarian in the deepest sense. He had
profound confidence and faith in, and complete respect for, the indi-
viduals who constitute society. For him it followed logically from
such a belief that the personal guarantees contained in the Bill of
Rights should occupy a preferred position in the constitutional scheme.
These guarantees, often referred to as 'civil liberties' or 'civil rights,'
seemed to him to merit special protection by the judiciary, so that the
usual presumption of constitutionality should be reversed when the
question concerned statutes impinging on these guarantees. In one
of his most famous and influential opinions, written for the Court
in the case of Thornhill v. Alabama, the late Justice declared that:
*
*
"The safeguarding of these rights to the ends that men may
speak as they think on matters vital to them and that falsehoods
may be exposed through the processes of education and discussion
is essential to free government. *
It is imperative that,
when the effective exercise of these rights is claimed to be abridged,
the courts should "weigh the circumstances" and "appraise the
substantiality of the reasons advanced" in support of the chal-
lenged regulations.'
7
"The same emphasis appears in his vigorous dissent from the Court's
holding in the first decision in Jones v. Opelika. Tersely, but sol-
emnly, Justice Murphy declared his conviction that 'If this Court is
to err in evaluating claims that freedom of speech, freedom of the
press, and freedom of religion have been invaded, far better that it
err in being overprotective of these precious rights.'

"He expressed this conviction perhaps most plainly in his dissenting
opinion in Prince v. Massachusetts. "In dealing with the validity of
[these] statutes,' the late Justice declared:
66 6* * *
* *
we are not aided by any strong presumption of the
constitutionality of such legislation.
* On the contrary,
the human freedoms enumerated in the First Amendment and
carried over into the Fourteenth Amendment are to be presumed
to be invulnerable and any attempt to sweep away those freedoms
is prima facie invalid. It follows [he concluded] that any re-
striction or prohibition must be justified by those who deny that
the freedoms have been unlawfully invaded.'
"Justice Murphy was anxious that democracy should exist in action,
in practice rather than merely in theory. Accordingly, he was pro-
foundly distressed by manifestations of discriminatory treatment
based on race. Governmental actions based on this factor were par-
ticularly abhorrent to him. In the Kahanamoku case, which arose
from the imposition of martial law in the Hawaiian Islands during
the recent war, he protested strongly against the implication that the
people of Hawaii, because of their racial situation, should be deprived
of trials by jury. He expressed his deep feeling in these moving
words:
66
'Especially deplorable, however, is this use of the iniquitous
doctrine of racism to justify the imposition of military trials.
Racism has no place whatever in our civilization. The Constitu-
tion as well as the conscience of mankind disclaims its use for any
purpose
* * * "
"In the Hirabayashi case, 10 Justice Murphy expressly pointed out
in his concurring opinion that 'Distinctions based on color and an-
cestry are utterly inconsistent with our traditions and ideals.' Never-
theless, he did not feel that he could declare unconstitutional the cur-
few order applied to persons of Japanese ancestry on our West Coast
in the early days of the recent war, even though he warned that he
considered that the 'restriction * * * goes to the very brink of
constitutional power.' But further than this he could not go. When
the Court in the Korematsu case 11 held constitutional the wartime re-
moval of Japanese-Americans from the West Coast, Justice Murphy
dissented. Solemnly, he declared:
66 6* * *
Such exclusion goes over "the very brink of con-
stitutional power" and falls into the ugly abyss of racism.
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
"'I dissent, therefore, from this legalization of racism. Racial
discrimination in any form and in any degree has no justifiable
part whatever in our democratic way of life. It is unattractive
in any setting but it is utterly revolting among a free people who
have embraced the principles set forth in the Constitution of
the United States.'
"The strength of his feeling on this subject never waned while he
lived. In the Restrictive Covenant cases 12 and in Smith v. Allwright,

the White Primary case, 13 he joined the Court in invalidating the
enforcement of restrictions against Negroes. Similarly, in the Steele
case, the late Justice concurred, expressly on constitutional grounds,
in the Court's decision invalidating conduct by a labor union, under
the Railway Labor Act, to discriminate deliberately against Negroes
because of their race. Once again, Justice Murphy gave expression
to the principle that 'The Constitution voices its disapproval whenever
economic discrimination is applied under authority of law against
any race, creed, or color.'
"The importance of procedure and administration in the rendition
of justice has long been recognized as fundamental. The late Justice
Murphy regarded it to be the duty of the Court to insist on strict
adherence to all the requirements of procedural fairness set out in
Constitution and statute. His vigorous dissent in the Yamashita
case, 15 objecting to 'the needless and unseemly haste' of the conviction
there; his strong statements in the Lyons case 16 on the extreme impro-
priety of admitting in evidence a second confession which was obtained
after a first one had been coerced; the exceptionally clear analysis
characterizing his dissent in Akins v. Texas," which involved the con-
stitutionality of the selection of a jury; his insistence on the fullest
definition of an accused person's right to counsel in the Canizio case; 18
his attitude toward police search and seizure as evidenced in his
Harris 19 and Trupiano 20 opinions: these and many others of his
written expressions from this Bench amply testify to his awareness
of and concern with the procedural protections to individual liberty.
"The late Justice Murphy was a great humanitarian, who combined
with his humanity and idealism a practical realism which moved
him always to emphasize the need for effective solutions to actually
existing problems. His practical idealism proved to be a precious
endowment to the people of his city, his State, and his Nation. It
is a quality all too rarely found in men. All of us have reason co
feel deeply the absence of Frank Murphy from our midst.
"Therefore, may it please the Court: On behalf of the Bar of this
Court, who speak in this matter for all the lawyers in our land, I move
that the Resolutions in memory of the late Justice Frank Murphy be
accepted by the Court and that, together with the chronicle of these
proceedings, they be spread upon the permanent records of this Court."
THE CHIEF JUSTICE said:
"Mr. Attorney General: It is with a satisfaction tinged with sad-
ness that I accept on behalf of the Court the Resolutions which have
just been tendered-satisfaction, because those Resolutions demon-
strate the appreciation which the Bar has for the works of Frank

of this kindly friend and brother. It is often said in ceremonies of
this nature that the esteem of one's fellows is the highest accolade
which can be accorded one in the legal profession. The many elo-
quent expressions of regret which came from so many different ele-
ments of our Nation at his demise have been no more sincere or lauda-
tory than your own. For one who never attempted or professed to
be a 'lawyer's lawyer,' your Resolutions thus become the highest of
praise.
"Full of the proverbial Irish wit and charm, Frank Murphy created
an atmosphere of warmth and friendship wherever he went. His
companionship was a constant delight to those of us who shared it.
Although you, Mr. Attorney General, and you, Mr. Solicitor General,
have indicated the awareness of the Bar to some of his most out-
standing services, I should like to recount them once again, for I
believe that the essence and spirit of Frank Murphy can best be re-
vealed by the manner in which he administered the many distin-
guished offices which he attained.
"Frank Murphy's history is one of Government service. He held
high office almost from the day he finished his graduate work in Lon-
don and Dublin to the date of his death. As an Assistant United
States Attorney, he prosecuted with effective vigor the graft and cor-
ruption which plague government systems. As a municipal judge
from 1923 to 1930, he instituted criminal reforms in his court and
won Nation-wide praise for the manner in which he conducted the
Sweet case. This trial took place in an ugly atmosphere of race prej-
udice and hysteria. Your Resolutions set forth that 'the commu-
nity, despite its original hostility, was convinced that the trial was
fairly conducted from the standpoint of the community as well as
the defendants.' His steadfastness was an application of a facet of
his belief which remained with him always—that our democratic sys-
tem insists upon equal protection for all persons, including minorities,
at all times. As Mayor of Detroit, in the depression years of 1930-
1933, he labored to diminish the unhappy plight of the jobless and
needy.
"Serving as Governor General and United States High Commis-
sioner to the Philippines from 1933 to 1936, he won and retained the
affection and esteem of the people of those Islands till the day of his
death. With his assistance and counsel, necessary reforms in the
government of those Islands were instituted and the transition from
the status of possession to independence was made easier.
"His administration as Governor of the State of Michigan from
1937 to 1938 was marked by his efforts to resolve two evils-depres-
sion and industrial strife. Both he met characteristically, the former
by calling a special session of the legislature in order to obtain money
to feed the starving-a function of the State he called 'elementary
humanity' the latter by refusing to evict forcibly the sit-down
strikers. This decision, which brought him national prominence
once again, illustrated his belief in the ability of the American people
to solve the most difficult problems of the day by the use of the peaceful
means of negotiation and conference. Indeed, this insistence upon
the measures of the conference table, rather than the bayonet, char-

TUESDAY, MARCH 6, 1951
150
acterized his entire administration of the industrial-relations dilemma
of one of our most highly industrialized States. Criticized at the
time as ineffectual and too partial, that approach, in the minds of
many, has been vindicated by the subsequent history of labor-manage-
ment relationships.
"And, as Attorney General of the United States from 1939 to 1940,
he attained a large measure of renown because of the integrity and
care with which his recommendations for judicial office were made.
But, his proudest achievement during this period was the establish-
ment of a Civil Rights Section in the Department of Justice to provide
the full weight of the Executive Branch of the Federal Government
in assuring the civil liberties of all of its citizens.
"Let it not be thought, however, that this impressive list of Frank
Murphy's achievements, which I have related and those character-
istics which I have emphasized, derogate from the other and perhaps
more routine aspects of his positions, for what ranked this man above
so many of his fellow citizens was his ability to accomplish ably and
to the fullest every detailed requirement of his offices, while never
neglecting or forgetting his ideals. Rare is the man with courage and
conviction who attains an office which will enable him to effectuate
those convictions. Frank Murphy held many such offices. Rarer still
is the man who, having attained high office, is able to hold fast to those
ideals without serious compromise, and yet is able to effect substantial
practical achievements consistent with those ideals. Frank Murphy
was such a man.
"The particularized actions and positions I have cited do not com-
pletely describe the man; they remain but indicia of his character.
Though he was sociable and friendly, he limited himself in joining
organizations lest there be a question as to the obligations he owed
those associations. Devout, he joined in opinions of this Court that
protected those who most bitterly assailed the religion to which he
was deeply devoted. Peace-loving, he volunteered and served his
country as an infantry officer in the First World War, and indeed
sought service in World War II, because of his conviction that it was
necessary to fight to preserve the democracy he loved. Tolerant, in
the noncondescending sense of the word, he became the protagonist
of the freedoms of those who were charged with attempting to destroy
those very freedoms.
"When Frank Murphy was appointed an Associate Justice of this
Court in 1940, he had already prosecuted fraud in high places. He
had witnessed the devastating effects of race prejudice and had bat-
tled poverty and hunger. He had assisted labor to rise to a new
position of respect in the community, and had helped mediate some
of the most violent struggles between management and labor. He
had seen imperfections in a criminal system in this country and had
assisted in the development of a foreign land from a possession to a
self-administering nation. It was inevitable that Frank Murphy's
frame of reference had as its centerpiece a vigilant defense of the
underdog and an unassailable belief in the overwhelming importance
of the individual.

"Frank Murphy would have been proud of the emphasis which
your Resolutions have placed on his stand on those issues which have
come to be known as civil liberties issues, for he himself characterized
civil liberties as 'the hallmarks of civilization' and the 'finest contribu-
tion America has made to civilization.' This conviction, formed in
those earlier years and nurtured while on this Court, crystallized in
his statement that ‘the law knows no finer hour than when it cuts
through formal concepts and transitory emotions to protect unpopular
citizens against discrimination and persecution.' In his philosophy,
the most important function of government in general, and this Court,
in particular, was the protection of individual freedom and thought
from restriction.
"In our accentuation of his vigorous stand on civil liberties and
labor issues we tend to forget the many other problems which received
his attention. Whatever the problem, each of his votes was his con-
sidered judgment, each of his opinions a clear and careful develop-
ment of the issues. It is interesting to note, for example, that almost
one-third of the majority opinions he wrote for this Court were con-
cerned with tax matters. His views on the power of both State and
national legislatures to alter existing economic conditions; his belief
that State statutes should not be upset merely because there was a
possibility that they conflicted with federal law; his respect for the
determinations of administrative tribunals all received eloquent ex-
pression in his opinions. It was in those areas of the law, however,
with which his experience had made him most familiar, that he be-
came the zealot, the protagonist, the valiant defender. I shall not
repeat at this time the citations to those opinions which are still fresh
in our memories. No matter what our own conclusions of the merits
of his views of those famous cases, Frank Murphy's fluent and cogent
presentation will ever force us to reflect on considerations which are
often submerged by the stress of modern times.
"Frank Murphy was, is, and, for years, will continue to be a con-
troversial figure. Whenever and wherever democracy is lived or dis-
cussed, the problem of the individual versus the state will occupy
men's thoughts and deeds. Frank Murphy's opinions, whether he was
writing for the Court, for himself and others in separate agreement,
or vigorous dissent, will be censured or revered, depending upon one's
own predilections. Whatever may be history's decision, however,
on his wisdom or the accuracy of his fears, all who read his words
will be impressed with his integrity, his courage, and his faith in the
principles for which he stood.
"As municipal, State, territorial, or federal executive, administrator,
or judge, Frank Murphy lived by the conviction that all men, if not
created in equal circumstances, must be treated equally before the law
and the majority who enact the law-that all men must be given the
opportunity to attain that equality of circumstance. By his life and
his deeds, those ideals were nourished and grew strong. By virtue
of his own character, the democracy he loved gained compassion and
vigor.
"Let the minutes of the Resolutions be spread on the records of this
Court."

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Present: Mr. Chief Justice Vinson, Mr. Justice Black, Mr. Justice
Reed, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, Mr. Justice Douglas, Mr. Justice
Jackson, Mr. Justice Burton, Mr. Justice Clark, and Mr. Justice
Minton.
Mr. Solicitor General Perlman addressed the Court as follows:
"At a meeting of members of the Bar of the Supreme Court, held
this morning, resolutions expressing their profound sorrow at the
death of Justice Wiley Rutledge were offered by a committee, of which
the late Roscoe Anderson, Esquire, was chairman. Addresses were
made to the Bar by Professor W. Willard Wirtz of the Northwestern
University School of Law, Judge Charles R. Clark of the United
States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and Professor Ralph
F. Fuchs of the University of Indiana School of Law. The resolu-
tions, adopted unanimously, are as follows:
"RESOLUTIONS
"Mr. Justice Rutledge died on September 10, 1949. The members
of the Bar of this Court have met in the Supreme Court Building on
Tuesday, April 10, 1951, to record their respect for him and their
heartfelt appreciation for his contribution to the law and life of our
Nation.
"Wiley Blount Rutledge was born on July 20, 1894, in the small
Ohio river town of Cloverport, Kentucky. He grew to manhood in
the heart of America. In many respects his life's history exemplifies
the fundamental soundness of our American democratic beliefs.
"The first six years of his life were spent in Cloverport. At the
end of that time, the family moved to Asheville, North Carolina, where
his father, a circuit-riding Baptist minister, had been called to a
church. Later the family moved back to Kentucky and then, in order
to be near better schools, they moved to Maryville, Tennessee. For
five years young Wiley Rutledge attended Maryville College, where
he majored in the classics. Here, his interest in the classics assumed
a personal aspect which transcended academic study. One of his
teachers of Greek was attractive, gracious, young Annabel Person.
He courted and won her heart, and they later became man and wife
on August 28, 1917. Of this marriage came three children: Mary Lou,
Jean Ann, and Neal.
"Meanwhile, however, young Rutledge transferred for the last year
of his undergraduate work to the University of Wisconsin, where he
majored in chemistry and received his B. A. degree in 1914.
"He then became interested in law but was confronted with the
stark necessity of financing his legal education by his own efforts.
Eight years passed and there were many interruptions before Wiley
Rutledge obtained his LL. B. degree from the University of Colorado.
908025-51-57

In the interim he taught commercial subjects at the Bloomington, Indi-
ana, High School while concurrently studying law at Indiana Univer-
sity, and he also taught school at Connersville, Indiana. During this
period of intense work he became the victim of an attack of tubercu-
losis, necessitating a year's rest at Asheville, North Carolina. He
then served as secretary to the Board of Education at Albuquerque,
New Mexico, for two years. In 1920, he moved to Boulder, Colo-
rado, where he again resumed the arduous task of concurrently teach-
ing in the public schools and studying law. His LL. B. degree was
finally obtained in 1922. After two years of private practice at
Boulder, he became a member of the University of Colorado Law
Faculty. This was the beginning of an eminently successful career
as law teacher and law school administrator, a career which con-
tributed richly to the sound development of legal education in the
midwest. In 1926, he became a member of the faculty of Washington
University School of Law in St. Louis, Missouri, becoming acting
Dean of that School of Law in 1930, and Dean from 1931 to 1935.
From 1935 to 1939, he was Dean of the College of Law of the State
University of Iowa. During his stay in Missouri and Iowa, he served
as a commissioner of the National Conference of Commissioners on
Uniform State Laws.
"As a teacher of law he had the happy faculty of arousing the
interest and latent talents of his students, and of stimulating their
best efforts. He was especially attracted by young people and his
sincere and genuine interest in his students was rewarded by their
warm and abiding affection. Throughout the late world war, in
spite of the increasing cares and burdens of his judicial office, he
found time to carry on a thoughtful and extensive correspondence,
frequently in longhand, with former students stationed throughout
the world in the various branches of the armed services, and these
students felt free to write to him for inspiration, encouragement,
and advice. To his former students he was always, in spite of his
exalted position, still a good friend and adviser.
"In April, 1939, President Roosevelt appointed him Associate
Justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia, on which Court he served until 1943, when the President
nominated him to the Supreme Court. This nomination was con-
firmed by the Senate, with only one Senator raising any question with
respect to the appointment. On February 15, 1943, Mr. Justice
Rutledge was inducted to the Court. He died at the age of fifty-five
on September 10, 1949, in York, Maine.
"There is the bare chronological history of Wiley Rutledge's life.
While it tells a good deal about him as a man, it leaves untold the
nature of his spirit and of his faith.
"Wiley Rutledge loved people. He believed deeply in the dignity
and worth of the individual. This was no theoretical or abstract
philosophical concept to him; it was a matter of daily living. During
the years of his development in the midwest, Wiley Rutledge learned
well the beliefs, hopes, fears, thoughts, emotions, disappointments,
pleasures, ambitions, and labors of people of all walks of life. He
constantly and frequently sought the company of other people. He
enjoyed nothing more than having an evening with a group of friends
in his home where the warmth of his hospitality afforded his guests
a privilege long to be remembered. The universality of his interest

TUESDAY, APRIL 10, 1951
177
in people was demonstrated by his attendance not only at meetings
of the American, State, and Local Bar Associations, but also at
gatherings of numerous civic and professional groups, Rotarians,
and Masons. He sought associations with all kinds of people whose
life stories and opinions he liked to hear informally. Wiley Rutledge
wanted to hear what others were thinking, what they believed. He
was a man of merry heart and cheerful countenance. He had the
faculty of generating sincere discussion without himself dominating
the group. He listened well and he understood. Having under-
standing, he had wisdom.
"He knew that men must be free, yet he knew also that there must
be order. Long ago, he realized that freedom and order have the
capacity for destroying each other. Without both, neither freedom
nor order can long endure. Wiley Rutledge believed that man can
accommodate freedom and order through the medium of justice. He
stated his beliefs simply:
666* * *
I believe in abstract justice, though I cannot define it.
But in any legal sense, I believe in it only as the source from which
conceptions of concrete and legally relevant justice arise. I believe in
concrete justice, in particular justice, and in the possibility of its
growth and expansion. I believe in it as the end of legal institutions
and in them as the means by which it may be achieved. I believe too
in the growth of the law and in this as the only means for making
reconciliation between the conflicting forces and conceptions, sepa-
rately considered, of order and freedom. Only thus may right accom-
modations in social living and the maintenance of stable, just social
relations be fulfilled.'
"As a judge, Wiley Rutledge boldly applied this simple creed to
the intricate problems presented to both the Supreme Court and the
Court of Appeals. Perhaps he was most widely known and is most
vividly remembered for his staunch position in the protection of indi-
vidual civil liberties. He was convinced that there is an irreducible
number of liberties which occupy a preferred position. He was as
adamant as the Rocky Mountains he loved so well in his belief that
these liberties especially must be protected if man is to remain free.
He insisted that the preferred position of the indispensable freedoms
secured by the First Amendment gives them 'a sanctity and a sanction
not permitting dubious intrusions.' To him this was a matter of prin-
ciple necessary to assure the vitality of our Nation, irrespective of the
character of the individual involved in any particular case. Thus, he
would protect the right of a labor organizer to address an audience
without first being required to procure a license. He would similarly
protect the right of an employer to talk to his employees. He would
be certain that even 'a thoroughgoing Nazi,' whose ideas he undoubt-
edly despised, be given due process. While he recognized the value
and necessity of the administrative process in today's complex life,
he would readily strike down administrative action which had not
provided due process of law.
"One reason Mr. Justice Rutledge is always associated with civil
liberties is the dramatic circumstances surrounding his entrance on
the Supreme Court. On February 15, 1943, the day he was inducted
to the Court, the Court announced that it was granting rehearings in
three cases.
One of those cases was Jones v. Opelika.¹ On June 8,
1319 U. S. 103.

TUESDAY, APRIL 10, 1951
178
1942, the Court, by a 5 to 4 decision, had upheld as constitutional a
municipal licensing ordinance as applied to the distribution of reli-
gious tracts by members of Jehovah's Witnesses. Upon retirement of
one of the justices from the Court, on the rehearing, the Court in a
5 to 4 decision vacated the prior judgment and found the ordinance
abridged freedom of press and restrained the free exercise of reli-
gion. Mr. Justice Rutledge cast his vote as one of the new majority.
"The emphasis on Mr. Justice Rutledge's concern for civil liberties
also arose from his practice of facing facts squarely. He always stated
his position straightforwardly. This was true whether he was writing
the opinion of the Court, a concurring or a dissenting opinion. As
noted by the New York Times, some of the questions he met head-on
were of 'a nature that might have tempted another judge to express
his dissenting views in a manner calculated to dodge the issue. This
Justice Rutledge never did.' A memorable example of this straight-
forwardness was his dissenting opinion in In re Yamashita.2 Mr.
Justice Rutledge was loath to be a dissenter in that case, but his deep
conviction that due process of law, as he understood it, could not be
abandoned forced him to dissent. It was with great tribulation, yet
with a profound sense of rightness, that Wiley Rutledge wrote:
*
*
"'More is at stake than General Yamashita's fate. There could be
no possible sympathy for him if he is guilty of the atrocities for which
his death is sought. But there can be and should be justice adminis-
tered according to law. *
It is not too early, it is never too
early, for the nation steadfastly to follow its great constitutional
traditions, none older or more universally protective against unbridled
power than due process of law in the trial and punishment of men,
that is, of all men, whether citizens, alien enemies or enemy belliger-
ents. It can become too late.'
3
"If the facts in a particular case revealed that a person was, in
substance, being denied due process of law, Mr. Justice Rutledge
would incisively condemn the procedure which permitted such denial.
This is well illustrated in his concurring opinion in Marino v. Ragen.³
There, he found that men convicted in violation of their constitutional
rights in Illinois were confronted by a 'procedural labyrinth ***
made up entirely of blind alleys.' To him, due process required that
such men have an adequate opportunity to be heard in court. He said:
'This opportunity is not adequate so long as they are required to ride
the Illinois merry-go-round of habeas corpus, coram nobis, and writ of
error before getting a hearing in a federal court.'
"He firmly believed that the 'main end of our society' and of our
constitution is the securing and perpetuating of individual freedom.
As he recognized in his concurring opinion in In re Oliver, the Bill of
Rights does restrict state authority in the invasion of personal free-
dom and such restriction is sometimes inconvenient to the authority.
Yet, the collapse of liberty in Europe in recent years emphatically
demonstrated to Mr. Justice Rutledge that ‘it is both wiser and safer
to put up with whatever inconveniences that charter creates than to
run the risk of losing its hard-won guarantees by dubious, if also more
convenient, substitutions imported from alien traditions.'

"The boldness with which Mr. Justice Rutledge took his stand on
basic individual liberties has tended to overshadow, temporarily at
least, other great contributions which he made to the law. Wiley Rut-
ledge was particularly fond of the word 'accommodation.' He used
that word much more frequently than it is ordinarily used today. It
was a word commonly used, sometimes in a colloquial fashion, by
the people of the midwest during the time Wiley Rutledge was grow-
ing up there. He used it in the several facets of its meaning. To him
this word meant 'To adjust, reconcile, to compose, settle, to bring to
harmony or agreement." To him this word meant To minister con-
venience to; to aid, speed, facilitate.' To him it meant 'To furnish
something requisite or convenient; to equip, supply, provide, to do
what is necessary to meet felt requirements.' After first securing in-
dispensable individual liberties, the primary function of the law
was, to him, a matter of accommodation. He cast labels aside and
sought the practical operation, actual or potential, of judicial action
upon any set of facts. To him, the greatest value of the commerce
clause of the Constitution was that it has enabled the Courts to make
the essential 'accommodation between nation and states.' He
thought the problem of justice is to find the right accommodation
in that 'never-ending process of accommodating freedom to law and
law to freedom.'
"Mr. Justice Rutledge might well be called the law's great accommo-
dator because he skillfully plied his ability to achieve significant
accommodations. This is readily apparent in his opinions involving
the application of the commerce clause, and its role in enabling the
accommodation of state and federal interests, in such cases as Pruden-
tial Insurance Co. v. Benjamin, Robertson v. California, Aero May-
flower Transit Co. v. Board of Railroad Commissioners, and Free-
man v. Hewit.

"There were times when he had to decide the point of accommoda-
tion between individual liberties and the requirements of society. One
such case was Brinegar v. United States which involved a claim that
there was unreasonable search and seizure where police officers had,
without a warrant, stopped the accused while he was traveling on the
highway and seized some liquor he was transporting. Under the
facts of that case, Mr. Justice Rutledge found that the officers had
probable cause for so acting. He said: 'Because many situations
which confront officers in the course of executing their duties are more
or less ambiguous, room must be allowed for some mistakes on their
part. But the mistakes must be those of reasonable men, acting on
facts leading sensibly to their conclusions of probability. The rule
of probable cause is a practical, nontechnical conception of affording
the best compromise that has been found for accommodating these
often opposing interests. Requiring more would unduly hamper law
enforcement. To allow less would be to leave law-abiding citizens at
the mercy of the officers' whim or caprice.'
"In this process of accommodation, Mr. Justice Rutledge respected
the acts of the legislative bodies of the Nation, both Federal and State,
as expressions of the people as to what laws were desirable to meet

felt requirements. He was prone to find acts of the legislature valid
unless they invaded some indispensable liberty. Moreover, he en-
deavored to apply and construe statutes in a workable manner and in
the spirit in which they were enacted. He abhorred the use of dog-
matic logistics in the construction and interpretation of statutes. In-
stead, he scrutinized the particular facts and the concrete consequences
so that considerations of policy were brought into the open.
"It was his belief in the potentialities of man to make accommoda-
tions that led Wiley Rutledge to have faith in the principle of
federalism. He advocated ardently the federal principle as a possible
solution to the world dilemma of today. Indeed, he believed that
federalism offers the only hope for the survival of democracy in our
time.
"Wiley Rutledge was a careful and thorough scholar. He brought
to the Court sound legal knowledge in a wide range of legal subjects.
His opinions were documented, meticulously and fully. Perhaps some
of his opinions are lengthy and discursive but he wrote so that those
who read would know what went through his mind in reaching his
decisions. Sometimes, he disclosed what he had considered and had
rejected and why he had done so. He did not want any potentially
relevant fact or principle of law to go unconsidered. He was willing
to expose his reasoning to the test of the future, for he knew that rea-
son is the life of the law; he knew that, too often, legal rules outlive
the reasons which bring them into being.
"A man of hearty good humor with an engaging twinkle in his eye,
Wiley Rutledge was a fine human being who lived life fully. He had
courage that manifested itself in gentleness. He had wisdom that ex-
pressed itself in simplicity. He had integrity that disclosed itself in
modesty. He had a faith that saw beyond the partial fact. While he
knew that we could not establish a perfect way of life, he accepted the
challenge of our fathers to make our Nation a more perfect union. He
had faith in the future and trust in life. He confidently believed in
the capacity of men to live and work together, to resolve their differ-
ences and to create and maintain a framework for existence in which
they could find a satisfying, if not a perfect, way of life. His own life
was a testament to this belief. He demonstrated the validity and the
practical soundness of his beliefs. Wiley Rutledge has given those of
us who remain a heritage of faith.
"It is accordingly-
"Resolved, That we, the Bar of the Supreme Court of the United
States, express our deep sorrow at the death of Mr. Justice Wiley
Rutledge and our thankfulness for the contributions which he made
to our profession and toward making our Nation a more perfect union.
"Resolved, That the Solicitor General of the United States be asked
to present this resolution to the Court; that the Attorney General of
the United States be asked to request that it be accepted by the Court
and inscribed upon its permanent records; and that copies of this
resolution be forwarded to the widow and children of Mr. Justice
Rutledge."
Mr. Attorney General McGrath addressed the Court as follows:
"May it please the Court: It has been related by a close personal
friend of the late Wiley Rutledge that he received consideration as a
possible nominee to fill three vacancies on this bench-and that on

TUESDAY, APRIL 10, 1951
181
each of those occasions he was, characteristically, supporting another
man for the appointment.10 To ignore his own superlative qualities,
and to speak out on behalf of another whom he thought better quali-
fied, was a typical course of conduct for the jurist in honor of whose
memory the Bar of this Court gathered together this morning. The
career of Wiley Rutledge was marked by the humility of the truly
great man.
"A short seven years, from 1943 to 1949, constitute the whole pe-
riod that the late Justice Rutledge occupied a seat on this bench,
and a single decade embraces the full span of his service in the ju-
diciary. Most of his professional life, after a brief period of private
practice in Boulder, Colorado, was spent in the academic field. There,
as teacher and as Dean, he served at the University of Colorado,
Washington University of Saint Louis, and the University of Iowa.
Thoughout his all-too-short life, his humility, all the more profound
in that its bearer was unconscious of its rarity among his fellow men,
characterized his every action.
"But there never was any suggestion of servility, or of any moral
or intellectual dependence upon others. On the contrary, he viewed
himself as a self-respecting man among men, with a philosophy that
was egalitarian in every sense. This was his own, a modest, view. To
others, his courage and independence of thought, his ability and his
intellectual capacity, and especially his determination to do his best
at any task, was enormous.
"Wiley Rutledge was humble rather as Lincoln was humble, with
the humility of one who recognizes that the spark of divinity has been
implanted in equal measure in every man. He felt deeply, I think,
that every individual, irrespective of his ancestry, his color, his re-
ligious beliefs, or his endowments personal or material, was entitled to
the basic respect of his fellows and of society. He was profoundly
aware of that measure of human dignity which is given to each of us,
and equally to each among us.
"Together with these fundamental attributes of the late Justice's
character, was a deep feeling of sympathy with humanity. This
manifested itself in an eager friendliness, and in the fullest enjoy-
ment of human companionship. Students, colleagues, friends-all
seemed to find comfort and counsel in his company. Each one who
needed or desired the attention or guidance of this man found the way
open to his affection and his interest. He loved humanity, and he
found time for many human beings to share in his life.
"It seems to me that this open-handed friendliness toward his
fellow men was closely related to another aspect of the late Justice's
philosophy. All of us who have grown to mature years have had
frequent occasion to realize the truth of the observation that a man's
essential character is revealed by his deeds. In the case of Justice
Rutledge, the humility, friendliness, and generosity which I have
attempted to describe were evidences of a living philosophy, of a mo-
rality in action. Justice Rutledge lived as he thought and felt. The
respect he felt for others he also accorded to himself, and felt no
need or wish to dissemble or to conceal. Toward mankind in general,
and for every human being in particular, he could not help but evi-
dence a true tolerance, so basic to his personality that he seemed not

182
even cognizant of its presence there. And this was, I think, one of
the foundation stones on which rested his conduct as a judge.
"For he was one who did not think in absolutes; to him it seemed
rather that the nature of man in society required the constant applica-
tion of change and adjustment. Always he seemed to be thinking that
the constant need is for balance, for the mutual accommodation of each
interest with others, to the maximum extent possible. No interest,
generally speaking, was considered by him as existing alone, in a
moral or legal vacuum, with all others disregarded. On the contrary,
Wiley Rutledge felt that truth lay in another direction, in the com-
position of inconsistent interests, and in the balancing of opposing
forces. He believed this process of accommodation, constantly in flux
because of the unceasing change in society itself, was of the utmost
importance to proper legal and moral thought and conduct. It per-
meated his thinking and his actions, both on and off the bench.
"Recognizing inevitable human fallibility, and yet ever cognizant
of the heavy obligations weighing on him as one having a share in
making decisions from whose consequences there was no appeal, Jus-
tice Rutledge could satisfy his conscience in the discharge of his obli-
gations only by contributing his best and fullest efforts to the decision
of every case. It was not in him to dispose of any question on the
basis of summary consideration, relying on others to bear the brunt
of the work. His zeal for rendering the best service that lay in him
was coupled with the unassumed modesty that refuses to allow its own
imperfections the generous understanding it accords the imperfec-
tions of others. This complicated his task, and made each new prob-
lem result in an increasing depletion of his strength and physical
stamina. He gave, literally, of himself until, finally, he had expended
the whole treasure of his vitality. I cannot believe, even if it had
been given him to peer through the mists that veil the future, and to
see in advance the exhaustion toward which he was moving, that
Wiley Rutledge would have altered his course by a single point of his
moral compass toward a safer haven. It was not his way to give less
than all he could.
* *
"I cannot let this occasion pass without reference to the effect of po-
sitions that Justice Rutledge took on the issues that came before this
Court during his tenure. Fundamental among all our basic tenets, in
his view, were the individual liberties of the Bill of Rights and the
Fourteenth Amendment, and of these he valued the freedom of com-
munication in particular. "*

scheme,' he remarked in his opinion for this Court in Thomas v. Col-
lins, 11
,11 'to the great, the indispensable democratic freedoms secured by
the First Amendment
gives these liberties a sanctity and
a sanction not permitting dubious intrusions.' And he meant to
cherish these great rights not as a mere academic shibboleth, unrelated
to practical considerations, but as a means of urging others to act.
For to Wiley Rutledge, the law had life. Our basic constitutional
guarantees, he insisted, were-

ing. "Free trade in ideas" means free trade in the opportunity to

"In In re Oliver, he declared his heartfelt belief that the Bill of
Rights is not 'a strait jacket of Eighteenth Century procedures,' but is
'a basic charter of personal liberty.' 13
"His sensitivity to issues wherein these protections might be com-
promised was extraordinary, and events gave him the opportunity to
contribute staunchly to their defense. His perspicacity in discerning
the basic danger to religious freedom in Busey v. District of Colum-
bia, which involved a tax on the sale of religious printed matter on
the public streets by members of Jehovah's Witnesses, has been at-
tested to by one of his brethren on the United States Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia.15 The dramatic circumstances in which
he was instrumental in bringing about a reversal of this Court's first
decision in Jones v. Opelika, 16 and its companion cases, is too well.
known for comment here. His opinions in the Everson 17 and Mc-
Collum 18
cases testify to his devotion to the principle of separation of
church and state.
"But his views were by no means doctrinaire. This very devotion
to freedom of religion, for instance, was qualified by his recognition
of the special responsibilities of a State toward young children, in
Prince v. Massachusetts. 19
"The importance of judicial procedure in the rendition of justice
was fully appreciated by Justice Rutledge, and he was consistently
scrupulous in insisting on the right of an accused to the established
safeguards of a fair trial. He found intolerable any departure from
those protections, and spoke out boldly in their defense. The repul-
sion he felt, for instance, at the procedure governing the trial and
conviction of the Japanese General Yamashita, called forth an elo-
quent dissent. He inferred that the opinion of the majority meant
that they considered the requirements of due process not to apply to
this accused, and wrote:
* *
*
66 6* * * I cannot believe in the face of this record that the peti-
tioner has had the fair trial our Constitution and laws command.
Because I cannot reconcile what has occurred with their measure,
I am forced to speak. At bottom my concern is that we shall not
forsake in any case, whether Yamashita's or another's, the basic
standards of trial which, among other guaranties, the nation fought
to keep;
and that this Court shall not fail in its part under
the Constitution to see that these things do not happen.' 20
"Justice Rutledge stood immovably for the proposition that an ac-
cused is absolutely entitled to the meticulous observation of essen-
tially fair procedures. 'In some respects,' he said in his United Mine
Workers 21 dissent, 'matters of procedure constitute the very essence of
ordered liberty under the Constitution.' In the Kotteakos case, he
declared that--

ciency. It too has a stake, with every citizen, in his being afforded

our historic individual protections, including those surrounding
criminal trials.' 22
"He felt strongly that the procedures by which fundamental rights
were assured to those accused of crime should be clear, effective, and
readily available. In his concurring opinion in Marino v. Ragen, 23
he protested vigorously against the procedural labyrinth' which he
felt made the choice of remedy within one jurisdiction so complex
that the accused's right was for practical purposes actually denied.
'One who does not know until the end of litigation what his pro-
cedural rights in trial are, or may have been,' he asserted, 'has no such
rights.' 24 To him, as he himself put it, 'the elemental protections
thrown about the citizen charged with crime,' which 'secure fair play
to the guilty and vindication for the innocent,' ranked equal in im-
portance with 'the great liberties of speech and the press
[and] religious freedom.' 25

"In the last analysis, it is the intangible heritage that a man leaves
behind him that constitutes his truly enduring monument. The faith
of Wiley Rutledge lay, he said, in ‘law, freedom, and justice.'
26 It is
a faith to which all of us, in good conscience, can repair.
"Therefore, may it please the Court: On behalf of the Bar of this
Court, who speak in this matter for all the lawyers in our land,
I move that the Resolutions adopted unanimously by the Bar of this
Court in memory of the late Justice Wiley Rutledge be accepted by
the Court and that, together with the chronicle of these proceedings,
they be spread upon the permanent records of this Court."
The Chief Justice said:
"Mr. Attorney General: I accept with deep personal appreciation
the Resolutions which have been proffered. The portrayal of Wiley
Blount Rutledge's career, which you have done so well, makes it easier
to understand and appreciate his contribution to this Court and our
Nation. At a Memorial Service held soon after the death of him whom
we honor today, it was said that 'he won both love and esteem in equal
and overflowing measure.' The wisdom of that statement has been
indicated by your Resolutions, which contain throughout, the golden
threads of love, respect and honor.
"Though Wiley Rutledge attained far greater national prominence
in his later years as a judge, the influence of his own personality and
character during his teaching years was a powerful force upon all
whom he touched. His students and his colleagues will esteem the
memory of Wiley Rutledge as that of a great teacher. He taught ably
the substantive matter which is described in the syllabi of courses in
catalogues. But, his niche in the hall of great teachers will be due to
his ability to bring home to his students the essentials of truth and
humanity. Characteristic, I think, of his constant search for the basic
values of society is the question he posed: 'Of what use is the law if it
does not meet human needs?' As a teacher, he was able to come into
close contact with people, to impart to them his own principles of
democratic living, his own sense of right and wrong. These years
played a great part in the development of his love for his fellow man,
and his awareness of their character, their aims, and their problems.

"President Roosevelt appointed him to the United States Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia in 1939. It is said that he as-
sumed this post reluctantly, in part because of his innate humility; in
part because of his unwillingness to leave those associations which had
become so dear to him; and in part because he feared his own effective-
ness would be diluted as a judge, rather than as a teacher. Fortunately
for those of us who shared his companionship after he came to the
bench, his humility and his reluctance did not prevail.
"My own acquaintance with Wiley Rutledge commenced when he
took his seat on the Court of Appeals. That friendship is one which
I shall ever cherish. It was one of the sweetest, truest friendships I
have ever encountered. His graciousness, his good humor, his sim-
plicity, his patience-to name but a few of his endearing traits-
brought a fresh breeze to the Court and made lighter its burden.
"The problems of the Court of Appeals proved peculiarly suited to
Wiley Rutledge's talents. Like the late Justice Cardozo, he derived
much satisfaction and renown from his treatment of problems which
are usually the concern of the state courts. One of the unique func-
tions of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Colum-
bia is to deal with local law, with the common law of torts, contracts,
wills and other problems, at times removed from the social and political
matters with which this Court is faced. These questions require schol-
arship, intimate familiarity with everyday problems, and a willingness
to adapt traditional forms to modern requirements. All these attri-
butes, Wiley Rutledge possessed to the maximum. His training had
been that of scholarship itself. His attitude was that of the progres-
sive and forward-looking judge. His philosophy placed him in har-
mony with those who sought solutions to the problems of daily living
in a complex society. And, while a judge on the Court of Appeals, he
manifested that concern for individual rights and freedom of thought,
speech and religion which was to bring him great tribute.
"Upon his appointment to this Court in 1943, Wiley Rutledge
brought with him a wealth of academic experience, a faith in the
law as the means by which freedom and justice are to be attained, and
a background of judicial technique. The years which he served on
this Court are too fresh in memory to warrant a detailing at this
time of the struggles and problems which concerned it. His own
stand on these problems is equally well known. Less familiar, per-
haps, is the fact that every case was for Wiley Rutledge an emotional
challenge. Every case required, not only the complete research of
authority and precedent his opinions demonstrate, but also a struggle
with his inner self to determine whether the result 'felt' right. Since
the law is the means by which society moves forward and achieves
freedom and justice for its people, every decision necessitates an
analysis of the consequences upon the individuals concerned and the
democracy in which we live. The answers to his questions never came
easily. His understanding of the law as a fluid thing did not allow of
the fast answer, the summary disposition. Nor was he reluctant to
speak out of his difficulties in reaching solutions. The Court has been
faced with many a problem which Wiley Rutledge had already fore-
cast and discussed in a concurrence or dissent of his own. His opin-
ions show the result of his struggles. Detailed and comprehensively
researched, they indicate the physical and emotional strain which

TUESDAY, APRIL 10, 1951
186
they caused him. It may be that his thoroughness and complete soul
searching in every case contributed to his leaving us in his prime. The
very factors which made Wiley Rutledge a great man made him a
great judge.
"In 1947 he published his 'Declaration of Legal Faith.' In it, he
analyzed the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution, which he
termed a 'federal device.' He conceived the Commerce Clause as the
means by which a unique balance between the states and the Federal
Government is achieved-on the one hand preventing concentrated
authority in any single place from sapping the lifeblood of the
people; on the other hand, by preventing 'Balkanization,' giving them
sufficient power to develop their own energies and abilities. His
philosophy of the relations between the state and Federal Govern-
ment, so clearly articulated in this short work, found expression in
many of the cases which treated the various aspects of this general
problem. Your Resolutions have mentioned his approach to these
issues, and I shall not reiterate. It is well to bear in mind, however,
in analyzing Wiley Rutledge's opinions in this field, that to him the
Commerce Clause was not the measure, but the means by which the
proper federal-state balance was to be achieved.
"This little treatise indicated, in an introductory chapter, his views
in another field in which he attained renown. This is his position in
cases involving the problems of governmental regulation of speech,
press and religion, and of criminal procedures.
"In your Resolutions, you referred to the decisive vote he cast in
Jones v. Opelika. This is but one example of the leading role he
played in the vindication of what he felt were those human values
which could not be transcended by governmental authority. The
opinions in which he gave voice to those convictions are fresh in the
memory. Still clear and distinct is the memory of his dissent in In re
Yamashita, an opinion which I always have felt expressed his demo-
cratic philosophy in his most eloquent and persuasive style. What-
ever may be history's decision on the merits of his position, no one
can read his words without admiration and, perhaps, a touch of awe
at his unqualified faith in the Anglo-American system of jurispru-
dence which is our heritage.
"Faith was the essence of Wiley Rutledge. He himself said that
the choice which nations and men must make as to what is valid and
true, must be at the last 'intuitive, must be felt.' What was right for
him had to be not only logically and analytically right-it had to be
intuitively right.
"Cases involving this conflict between individual and governmental
action received a substantial portion of this Court's attention during
the period Wiley Rutledge was an Associate Justice. To state that
he was one of the most outspoken and consistent defenders of indi-
vidual and group rights is to do no more than to redefine that faith
I have attempted to outline. On many occasions, he wrote for the
majority of this Court. In others, a majority felt that other interests.
or considerations were paramount in the particular case before the
Court. But, whether his opinion became the law or fell into dissent,
each of his determinations was an honest, conscientious judgment,
consistent with his instinctive sense of right and wrong. Regardless
of the divergence in opinion, no colleague ever had doubt that Wiley
Rutledge believed he was right.

"Many men who have been possessed of dogged determination or a
fiery belief in what they conceived to be the right have been trans-
formed in their personalities into cross-grained, narrow fanatics, who
will not listen to the views of others. It is to the glory of Wiley
Rutledge that his faith and his purpose never warped his relationships
with others. Whether positions coincided or diverged made no differ-
ence in the warmth of his friendship. The spiritual goodness of his
person remained a constant.
"His home was what a home should be. His wife, son and two
daughters are testimonials and exhibits to the beauty of his character
and the concrete manner in which he practiced those ideals he ex-
pressed so consistently. As a teacher, judge, father and husband,
Wiley Rutledge was a supreme advocate, by his very example, of the
way of life his faith bade him follow.
"In the introduction to his 'Declaration of Legal Faith,' he stated:
'I believe in law. At the same time I believe in freedom. And I know
that each of these things may destroy the other. But I know too that,
without both, neither can long endure.' Wiley Rutledge's life was
devoted to an attempt to effect an accommodation between freedom
and law, to conjoin freedom and justice with law. If aims alone were
the measure of a man, he would be listed among the great of our
Nation. But his implementation of those aims, his own career and
influence, prove that his greatness extended beyond mere aims. His
spirit and character will ever remain a noble point in the history of
this Court.
