Order. It is hereby ordered that James D. Maher be appointed
clerk of this court in the place of James H. McKenney, deceased,
and that he forthwith take the oath of office and give bond condi-
tioned according to law.
The Chief Justice then said:
In entering the order appointing a clerk because of the death of
Mr. McKenney, the court is unwilling to let the occasion pass with-
out making some note on its records of the character of the services.

18
rendered by Mr. McKenney to the court and the country for so long
a time, and also without expressing for permanent record the sorrow
which the members of the court feel at the loss which has been occa-
sioned by the death of Mr. McKenney. Mr. McKenney became con-
nected with the work of the court as far back as 1858, first as a
junior clerk, then as acting deputy, then, when the statute authorized
it, as the deputy clerk; and finally, in 1880, upon the death of Mr.
Middleton, he became clerk of the court. During all that long period
of more than 50 years, with diligence, with fidelity, and with honor,
he served the court and the country. The consolation at his loss to
the court and the country is this: That no one can look over the period
of time during which he served and consider the grave subjects with
which the court dealt during that time, and with reference to which
the clerk was called upon within his sphere of duty to act, and deny
that the effect of those services so faithfully rendered redounded to
the benefit of the people of the country and to the preservation of
our constitutional system of government which remains as the safe-
guard of every right and the guaranty of the liberties of all. The
consolation of those united to him by ties of kindred and personal
affection is that they have the heritage of a long, virtuous, and well-
spent life which, if contemplated in the light of faith, brings to
them the assurance that its rectitude finds place on the minutes of that
court of everlasting and infinite power to which all human conduct
must come for ultimate judgment; and that that record affords ground
for faith to believe that the one whose loss they deplore is gone to his
everlasting reward.
