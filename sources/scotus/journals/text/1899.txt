No. 74. The United States, petitioner, v. H. Wolff & Co. In these
cases leave is given to file further briefs, and the attention of counsel is
called to the following questions: What is the precise scope and effect,
in this court, of the stipulation of March 18, 1897, respecting the char-
acter and alternative classifications of the merchandise whose proper
classification is at issue? When, if at all, might the purpose for which
beads were threaded or strung be held not to prevent their classification
as beads, loose, unthreaded, or unstrung, under paragraph 445 of the
tariff act of 1890? As respects articles which were in fact beads, and
which were threaded and strung and were intended to be used for the
purposes for which beads are normally used, was it the intention of
Congress that such as imitated precious stones, and did not exceed one
inch in dimensions, and were not set, should be cutiable under paragraph
454 of the tariff act of 1890, and that such as did not imitate precious
stones should be the subject of a different classification?
