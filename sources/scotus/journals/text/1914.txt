SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES.
MONDAY, OCTOBER 12, 1914.
The Court met pursuant to law.
Present: The Chief Justice, Mr. Justice McKenna, Mr. Justice
Holmes, Mr. Justice Day, Mr. Justice Hughes, Mr. Justice Van
Devanter, Mr. Justice Lamar, and Mr. Justice McReynolds.
The Chief Justice said:
"It gives me pain to say that since the court adjourned at the
end of the last term it has come to pass that the nation may no
longer enjoy the fruitful and beneficent results to arise from the
continued enlightened and devoted discharge by Mr. Justice Lurton
of his public duties. He died at Atlantic City on the 5th day of
July. In addition to the sorrow which they share with their country-
men at so great a loss, the members of the Court have suffered the
pang caused by the severance of the close personal ties which bound
them to Mr. Justice Lurton; ties the strength of which can not be
fully appreciated without understanding how completely his attain-
ments and his lovable traits of personal character commanded the
respect and drew to him the warm affection of those who had the
privilege of being associated with him in the performance of his
judicial duties.
"In the month of August the Hon. James Clark McReynolds
was appointed an Associate Justice of this court, to fill the vacancy
caused by the death of Mr. Justice Lurton, and on the 3d day of
September the oath of office required by section 1756 of the Revised
Statutes was administered to Mr. McReynolds by the Chief Justice.
The new Justice is present to-day, and before he takes his seat the
Clerk will read the commission and will administer to him the oath
pointed out by section 257 of the Judicial Code; that is, the judicial
oath."
The Clerk then read the commission, and Mr. McReynolds took
the oath of office, and was escorted by the Marshal to his seat on
the Bench.
The Chief Justice continued:
"To enable the members of the court to pay their respects in a
body to the President, as has been the usage from the beginning,
the court will adjourn to-day without transacting business until the
65349-14-1

2

usual hour to-morrow. All motions, therefore, which are noticed for
to-day will stand over until to-morrow, when the call of the docket
will be begun. Before adjourning to-day, however, applications for
admission to the bar will be entertained, as well as any other formal
motion which may be disposed of as a matter of course. "
"

"Gentlemen of the bar: It is my painful duty to announce that
since we last met the marshal of the court, Maj. Wright, has died.
This day 27 years ago he entered upon the performance of his duties
as marshal of this court, and from that time until a few hours ago,
when he was called to his last account, with that modesty, simplicity,
and honorable devotion to duty exhibited in so many instances by
the children of that great school out of which he came the Military
Academy of West Point-he discharged the responsibilities resting
upon him as the marshal of this court. In war and in peace he
exemplified in his life a patient, simple, brave, single-minded, and
devoted performance of public duty. Therefore, as a token of the
affection we bore him and of the respect we had for him, we shall do
nothing to-day but hear motions to admit and other motions and
adjourn until to-morrow morning."

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES.
MONDAY, JUNE 14, 1915.
Present: The Chief Justice, Mr. Justice McKenna, Mr. Justice
Holmes, Mr. Justice Day, Mr. Justice Hughes, Mr. Justice Van
Devanter, Mr. Justice Lamar, Mr. Justice Pitney, and Mr. Justice
McReynolds.
The Attorney General addressed the court as follows:
May it please your Honors: In presenting the resolutions adopted
by the memorable meeting of the bar, held in this room on March 27,
to do honor to the memory of Mr. Justice Horace Harmon Lurton, I
might well be contented with the observation that the resolutions
show such intimate acquaintance with his eventful career and such
discriminating appreciation of his character and attainments as man
and judge as to demand nothing more.
With respect to Justice Lurton, my lines were so cast that a meas-
ure of the personal appropriately attaches, without which the part
I am performing might in a sense be regarded somewhat in the light
of one of the graceful functions belonging to the official station I
hold. My personal acquaintance with Justice Lurton began when as
a youth I attended college at Clarksville, Tennessee, where he, subse-
quent to his service as chancellor, was the ascendant light at an
unusually strong bar. After leaving college and moving West I next
saw him some ten years later in Nashville presiding as chief justice
of the Supreme Court of Tennessee. My presence on this occasion
was almost accidental, but I recall with interest the fact that the
attorney addressing the court was the distinguished gentleman who
succeeded Justice Lurton upon this bench and whose former official
position I now hold.
Justice Lurton possessed a singular charm of candid affability.
He took a lively interest in the aspirations and endeavors of younger
men, particularly young lawyers. Whenever the opportunity offered,
he encouraged them and gave them incentive to noble endeavors. I
am one of the many who profited by his friendship.
That the men who strive are the men who succeed was eminently
illustrated in the achievements of this life. He was denied the advan-
| tages of a completed college education. The hardships of the soldier,
the privations of the prisoner, and the experience of the practitioner,
89149-15 117

239
quickened by a keen interest in public affairs and a studious disposi-
tion, were all utilized. The winds blew and the waters rolled to him
knowledge and power, and the influences of the eventful times of his
youth and early manhood so broadened him that he understood the
varying phases of life and character, though he studied them to the
end.
In the enchanted circle of home, around friendship's shrine, in
the conflicts of the forum, in the temple of justice, in the sanctuaries
of the living God, Justice Lurton was the same open, wholesome
model of uplifting human character-a Christian gentleman. As a
man, he bound himself to us by the strongest and tenderest ties.
It was as a judge, who ripened and gathered strength from the
period of his early chancellorship, through service in the Supreme
Court of Tennessee and the seventeen years of larger vision on the
circuit court of appeals, culminating in, and completed by, his brief
but valuable work on the Supreme Court of the United States, that
the deceased won his most enduring laurels.
When he went to the Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit he
found it established in the confidence of the profession, and he con-
tributed to the maintenance of its high standing. Coming to this
court from a section so prolific in great judges, he fulfilled the
measure of the expectation thus engendered.
Justice Lurton was appointed at a riper age than any other man ever
elevated to this bench. The deviation from what is generally a sound
and acceptable rule was justified by the scope and length of his
varied judicial experience and the richness of the results which had
flowed therefrom.
While death claimed him sconer than could have been reasonably
contemplated, his service here was singularly useful and beneficent.
Aside from the invaluable work performed in connection with the
preparation and adoption of the equity rules, Justice Lurton, in the
four and one-half years he adorned this bench, wrote the opinion of
the court in ninety-eight cases, many of them involving issues of
the gravest importance. Some of these opinions are destined to
stand as leading authorities. He found himself constrained to dis-
sent from the majority of the court in eighteen cases, and with
respect to two of them filed dissenting opinions ably sustaining his
views.
His style was admirable because of the clear and logical way in
which he illuminated the subject in hand, each step in his reasoning
following steadily after that which had gone before, with the rythm
and certainty of a soldier's tread, so that when the end was reached
there was no element of uncertainty as to what he had decided or
meant to decide. He systematized facts and decomposed them into

240
their elements, applying to them the principles of law and equity
with unfailing precision.
To his other great qualities Justice Lurton added powers of pains-
taking investigation, depth of research, and an accuracy in the use
of our language that must ever make his opinions models of judicial
composition. The loss of such an one may indeed be rightly regarded
as a public calamity.
Actuated by these sentiments, sharing the spirit of these appropri-
ate and appreciative resolutions, I present them to the court, as I am
bidden by the bar to do, and request that a befitting order be entered,
directing their perpetuation on the minutes of the court.
I now read the resolutions:
We, members of the bar of the Supreme Court of the United States,
moved by our high regard for the character and public services of
Mr. Justice Horace H. Lurton, who departed this life on the 12th
day of July, 1914, have met at Washington, this 27th day of March,
1915, for the purpose of discharging what we regard as a high public
duty in honoring the memory and recording our estimate of one who
as a man, a citizen, a jurist, and a judge has greatly honored our
country, and adopt the following:
Horace Harmon Lurton was born on February 26, 1844, in New-
port, Ky. His early life was passed partly at Clarksville, Tenn.,
and partly in the city of Chicago.
When the Civil War began he was a student at the old University
of Chicago. He at once returned to Tennessee, and at the age of
sixteen joined the army of the Confederate States, enlisting in the
Thirty-fifth Tennessee, of which he became sergeant major.
He was captured at Fort Donelson and was imprisoned at Camp
Chase, from which, after a brief confinement, he escaped. He re-
enlisted in the Third Kentucky Cavalry, and while serving under
Gen. John H. Morgan, during his raid in Ohio, was again cap-
tured in 1863 and imprisoned, where he was confined until early in
1865. At that time, on account of his health, and in response to a
personal appeal made by his mother to President Lincoln, he was
released on parole.
His collegiate education thus interrupted was never completed,
but it was richly supplemented by constant study and copious
reading.
He graduated in law at Cumberland University, Lebanon, Tenn.,
in 1867. There he met Miss Frances Owen, who, in the same year,
became his wife, and survives him. Their married life was an unin-
terrupted period of mutual love and comfort.
He entered upon the practice of his profession at Clarksville,
Tenn., and continued until 1875, when he became a chancellor of
Tennessee.

241
In 1878 he resigned and returned to the bar. He was associated
in partnership at various times with Gustavus A. Henry, William A.
Quarles, James E. Bailey, and Charles G. Smith, who were among
Tennessee's most distinguished lawyers. He was a recognized leader
and enjoyed a large practice.
In 1886 he was elected as judge of the Supreme Court of Ten-
nessee, and served continuously until April, 1893, being chief justice
the last four months of his service.
In that year he was appointed United States circuit judge by
President Cleveland, and became a judge of the Court of Appeals
for the Sixth Circuit.
He became professor of constitutional law at Vanderbilt Univer-
sity in 1898 and dean of the law school in 1905, which positions he
held until 1910.
In 1899 he received the degree of doctor of civil laws from
Sewanee University, and in 1912 the degree of doctor of laws from
the University of Pennsylvania.
In December, 1909, he was appointed by President Taft to the
Supreme Bench of the United States, and took his seat January 3,
1910, in which position he served until his death.
Upon his appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States
he was sixty-five years of age, being the oldest man ever appointed to
that court. There were sound reasons for such distinction. He had
been upon the bench thirty years and had achieved as chancellor a
high reputation as an able, learned, conscientious, industrious, and
impartial jurist, which was maintained, with increased prestige,
throughout his long service on the Supreme Bench of Tennessee and
as United States circuit judge.
He came to the Supreme Court equipped with an experience and
learning that few appointees to that court have had. His long
service upon the Federal bench especially qualified him to enter at
once with full efficiency upon his duties.
President Taft had collaborated with him seven years in the Cir-
cuit Court of Appeals and well knew his fitness for the high office
for which he nominated him.
During a continuous service on the bench, State and National, for
a period of over thirty years, he decided almost every kind of case
which human affairs could give rise to. His opinions, which are to be
found in Pickle's Tennessee Reports, the Federal Reporter, and the
Reports of the Supreme Court of the United States, are character-
ized by learning, conciseness, and lucidity, are convincing witnesses
of his justice, wisdom, industry, and comprehensive grasp of legal
principles, and constitute a great and enduring monument to his
fame.

242
He was thoroughly grounded in the fundamental principles of
the law, and always maintained a profound reverence for constitu-
tional safeguards.
In an address made at a joint meeting of the Maryland and Vir-
ginia Bar Associations in 1910 he said:
"The contention that the obligation of a constitution is to be
disregarded if it stands in the way of that which is deemed of
public advantage, or that a valid law, under the Constitution, is to
be interpreted or modified so as to accomplish that which the execu-
tive administering it or a court called upon to enforce it shall deem to
the public advantage, is destructive of the whole theory upon which
our American Commonwealths have been founded, to say nothing
of the constitutional relation of the Union and the States to each
other. It is a substitution of men for a government of law. It is
against this that I raise a warning voice."
He fully recognized the rights of persons and property, but did not
hesitate to give full effect to constitutional legislation changing such
rights.
He rendered no startling or sensational decisions. While this is
true, he recognized fully the expanding and complex affairs of mod-
ern life and government and the necessity for the application of old
principles to changed conditions. However, he never under this
guise gave sanction to judicial legislation. His attitude on this vital
principle is well shown by his own utterance in the case of John D.
Park & Son against Hartman, in which he said:
"It has been suggested that we should have regard to new com-
mercial conditions and a tendency toward a relaxation of old com-
mon-law principles which tend to prevent development on modern
lines. This is an argument better addressed to legislative bodies
than to the courts. Neither is it wise for the courts to countenance
the introduction of artificial distinctions dependent upon the variant
economic views of individual judges. Distinctions which are specious
or analogies which are but apparent will but afford opportunities to
whittle away broad economic principles lying at the bottom of our
public policy, principles which have long received the sanction of
statesmen and the approving recognition of a long line of jurists. A
like argument is expected whenever some new method of circumvent-
ing freedom of commerce comes under the tests of the law."
He was frank in expressing his views and always courageous in
the performance of duty. He was quick to see and comprehend the
points of argument, and clear, direct, and forceful in stating his
conclusions.
He had an amiable disposition and a charming personality, which
endeared him to a large circle of warm friends.
His associates loved and honored him, and the members of the bar
who came before him entertained profound respect for his ability

243
and efficiency as a judge, and hold his conduct toward them, which
was always characterized by unfailing graciousness, attention, and
patience, in most pleasing remembrance.
Both on and off the bench he was affable and courteous, without
any appearance of seeking popularity. He was firm and impersonal
in his rulings, without any touch of harshness. His manner was
impressive and dignified, without show of authority.
He bore a conspicuous part in drafting the new Federal Equity
Rules, and went to England for the purpose of informing himself
as to the changes there in equity practice and their effect.
He left to his family the rich legacy of a stainless and unquestioned
life.
He early became a member of the Episcopal Church, was constant
in church duty, and for a long time preceding and at the time of his
death held the position of vestryman in that church. His religion
was not merely a profession, but its principles were constantly illus-
trated in his daily life.
In politics he was a Democrat.
Although he was a strict party man and believed that government
should be administered through parties, and took a deep interest in
politics and frequently was prominent and influential in political
affairs, State and National, he never sought political office.
He and his colleague, Mr. Justice Harlan, twice during the Civil
War were opposed in battle. Notwithstanding they had fought on
opposite sides in support of conflicting views as to the Constitution,
they were in substantial accord in their judicial utterances on the
fundamental principles of our Government.
The fact that one who had borne arms against a government and
had been imprisoned by that Government, subsequently through its
expressed will, sat in a tribunal which had final jurisdiction over the
property, liberty, and lives of its people, and the interpretation of
its Constitution, is a tribute to the qualities that found such dis-
tinguished recognition. It bears, however, for our whole Nation,
for all time, and especially now, when the passions of a great war
are manifesting themselves with fearful violence, a deeper lessonâ
that of a great people subduing in so short a time their prejudices,
and following the injunction of Mr. Lincoln "with malice toward
none, with charity for all," turning their backs with magnanimity
upon the strife of the past, and doing those things which reunited our
country in a common destiny, based upon a reconciliation, genuine
and complete, and without example in history.
Respect for those in office, because they represent the sovereign
power, is essential for stability of government. It is fortunate for a
people to be served by those to whom honor is rendered, not only

244
during incumbency of office but after they have passed out of office
and out of life. The record of the lives of such men is the richest
heritage and the highest inspiration that a people can possess.
This meeting is not to render grateful praise to one who can show
appreciation to those who are present. It is not a perfunctory tribute
to place, for we are met to solemnly record our estimate of the
services of one who has passed beyond the sense of praise or censure.
Tried by the standards which constitute the just test of title to the
esteem of his countrymen, we confidently say that Mr. Justice Lurton
is worthy of lasting commemoration in the annals of the Nation:
Therefore be it
Resolved, By the Bar of the Supreme Court of the United States,
that in the death of Mr. Justice Horace H. Lurton, the bar and the
people of the United States have sustained a great loss; that we
deeply sympathize with his family and friends in their bereavement;
that a copy of these proceedings be sent to Mrs. Lurton, and that,
through the Attorney General, it be asked that they be spread upon
the minutes of the Supreme Court of the United States.
The Chief Justice responded:
Mr. Attorney General, the motion which you make gives us solace,
since it affords us an opportunity, by putting of record the resolutions
which you so appreciatively present, to become participants in the
action of the bar and thus again to manifest our sense of sorrow at
the death of Mr. Justice Lurton.
The attachment between Mr. Justice Lurton and a member of this
court resulting from prior association in judicial work in another
forum and between others resulting from a personal friendship of
long standing, came when he took his seat upon this bench to unite
him with all its members because of the resulting knowledge of his
attainments and endearing character.
I asked one of my brethren not long since what was the mental
quality of Mr. Justice Lurton which most impressed him. He said,
"He was a lawyer, fully equipped by training and by experience to
do the work which came to him to do." How terse and yet how
comprehensive the analysis, since it embraced the developed powers
of discrimination controlled by a trained and ripened intellect which
enabled him intelligently to consider and clearly to understand the
complex conditions and problems concerning which he was called
upon as a judge to act. Accurate as was the portrayal, the inade-
quacy of the likeness which results is manifest unless there be added
to the picture the lineaments of the man, his simplicity, his fidelity,
his warmth of friendship, his tenderness to those he loved, all unit-
ing with his intellectual qualities to make him what he was-a

245
lovable and true man, an able and conscientious lawyer, and an
intelligent, courageous, and devoted judge.
If there were time to review his public services, it would be un-
necessary, since the mere mention of the landmarks of his career
will bring out in bold relief his title to the admiration and respect
of his countrymen. A practicing lawyer, a chancellor, a member of
the Supreme Court of Tennessee. either as an associate member or
its chief justice, from 1886 to 1893. a United States circuit judge
from 1893 until he became a justice of this court in 1910. Mark the
progressive evolution of his career and the irresistible inference of
duty faithfully done which it affords. And to add to this demonstra-
tion take into view the judgment of the bar who practiced before him
and the reports of the several courts during his service. The re-
sponsibility which he thus so worthily met is indicated by consider-
ing the grave duties which have rested upon State courts of last resort
and upon the circuit courts of the United States from the beginning
and the services which both have rendered to the security of life,
liberty, and property, to the progress of our country, and to the
perpetuation of our constitutional institutions. But that view does
not give a full appreciation of the value of the work of Mr. Justice
Lurton as a United States circuit judge. Bear in mind that when he
became a circuit judge the circuit courts of appeals had been rela-
tively newly created and the necessity for their existence as well as
their future usefulness was in some minds far from certain. The
benefit, therefore, to the country of the work of the court of ap-
peals of the sixth circuit during his membership can not be judged
alone by the volume and character of the business which came before
it and by the enlightened manner in which that business was dis-
posed of, but by considering how its discharge of duty cooperating
in its full proportion with the work of the courts of appeals of
other circuits demonstrated the wisdom of having created those
courts and besides made certain how much the progress and develop-
ment of our judicial institutions would be benefited by their con-
tinued existence.
I do not review the work of Mr. Justice Lurton on this bench. It
speaks for itself, since it demonstrates the benefit to the court and
country which arose and would have continued to result had it been.
given to him, as we had all hoped it would be, to devote his matured
powers to the service of the country for a long period of time. But
this was not to be vouchsafed. Illness came, and when its serious
character was apparent, in company with that comrade, high cour-
age, which had been with him all the days of his life, comforted by
the care and tenderness of those he so much loved and sustained by

246
Christian faith and hope, he passed beyond our mortal vision. The
unbidden thought which comes as to the fleeting result of all human
effort, its perishability and the resulting despondency, is natural
from such a loss, and the miasma of pessimism which they produce
enveloped me as with those of my brethren who could do so we jour-
neyed to Clarksville, Tenn., where he began his active career after
the Civil War, there to lay him to rest. But as I stood by the open
grave, surrounded by the kindly faces of so many of the warm-
hearted people of Clarksville, who had gathered to pay their tribute
of respect and affection, and heard the plaintive melodies of the old
hymns telling of Christian faith and hope, pessimism vanished, and
I came to feel death is not forever, and good works do not perish,
but remain. Yes; it was given to me to think, as the waving wheat
field in sunshine and in rain conserves its energy in the grain which
long after the stem has been cut down and perished, pressed under
the millstone, gives forth the nutriment of our material existence,
why may we not believe that in the vast reservoir of Divine Provi-
dence the energy of our good deeds is conserved, so that they may
continue when we have gone to aid and bless our country and our
countrymen? What can better illustrate this truth than the work of
the lawyer and the judge, since the rule of justice which solves the
controversy of to-day becomes the rule of conduct preventing the
arising of contention in the years to come? Can we doubt if we listen
to the voices of Ulpian and Trebonian calling us through the turmoil
and dust of ages to the regions where reason dominates and hence
justice prevails? But so distant an example need not be sought.
Who of us has not known controversies as to powers of government
whose complexities and difficulties were so great that their solution
threatened the destruction of our constitutional system either by the
disregard of national power or the overthrow of local authority?
Insoluble, indeed, they have seemed when from out the past the voice
of Marshall spoke and order prevailed, and State and Nation con-
tinued to move in harmony and majesty in their allotted orbits to the
safety and blessing of our country and mankind.
Indeed, the truth of which I am speaking is illustrated in an epi-
sode in the life of Mr. Justice Lurton. We all recall that when he
was in his youth a private in the southern army he was a prisoner
of war, confined, I believe, on Johnsons Island, enduring the hard-
ships of prison life and suffering from the intense rigor of the north-
ern winter climate, to which he was not habituated. The youth's
health failed and the fear came that his end was not far off. His
mother, learning of the situation, pleaded from person to person
until she came into the presence of President Lincoln to state her
89149-15-118

247
sorrow and out of the depths of her anguish to make her prayer for
relief. Let us transport ourselves in imagination to the scene and
listen to the mother's supplication and hear the answer from the
lips of President Lincoln, springing from that well of compassion
which was one of the supremest attributes of his nature: "Yes; let
the mother have her boy." Ah! If it had been given to us to stand
in reality where we have stood in fancy to-day, who of us would
have thought when the storm of war which was then raging had
ceased it would come to pass through the enduring power of the in-
fluence of the patriotism of our forefathers and of the wise institu-
tions they had established that on the very dawn of peace one would
seek in vain to find the erstwhile embattled armies, for they had
vanished, leaving only a great host of devoted citizens seeking to
serve their united country in peace with the devotion with which,
as they had understood it, they had sought to serve it in war? And
who of us would have thought that it would soon be seen that the
giving of the youth to the mother was the giving to the country of
an enlightened and faithful public servant who, when the storm of
war had passed, having been freed from imprisonment himself,
would yet seek by a devoted discharge of his public duties to im-
prison his countrymen by binding them with enduring ties of respect
and affection for the institutions of our forefathers, and who would
be found dedicating his life to such work when the voice of the
Father called him from the highest judgment seat in the land to
what we would fain believe was his reward eternal.
These thoughts, while they afford consolation for our loss, should
stimulate our endeavors. In this latter aspect let us, both judge and
lawyer, before we leave these hallowed precincts to-day-hallowed
because here justice is administered and here we each and all have
avowed our fealty to the Constitution and our purpose to maintain
it-resolve to seek more devotedly to discharge the duties which are
upon us, to the end that, following in the footsteps of our brother
whose life we to-day recall and of all those noble souls who have gone
before, we may live by our good works; yes, continue to live when
we are gone.
The resolutions of the bar and your remarks, Mr. Attorney Gen-
eral, will be spread upon the minutes, and any other tributes that may
be received will be placed upon the files.
