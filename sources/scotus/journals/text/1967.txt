MONDAY, OCTOBER 2, 1967
In the Supreme Court of the United States
1
Present: Mr. Chief Justice Warren, Mr. Justice Black, Mr. Justice
Douglas, Mr. Justice Harlan, Mr. Justice Brennan, Mr. Justice Stew -
art, Mr. Justice White, Mr. Justice Fortas, and Mr. Justice Marshall.
The Chief Justice said:
"The 1967 Term of the Supreme Court of the United States is now
convened, and thankfully with a full Court.
"As was announced on June 12, 1967, the last day of the 1966 Term,
Justice Clark retired after 18 years of distinguished service on the
Court. While we still feel the loss of his wisdom and companionship,
the felicitous reason for his retirement compels us to forego the regret
which we would otherwise have.
"Happily, during the Summer recess, the President, with the ad-
vice and consent of the Senate, has appointed the Honorable Thur-
good Marshall of New York an Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court to succeed Justice Clark.
"Justice Marshall has taken the Constitutional Oath administered
by Mr. Justice Black. He is now present in Court. The Clerk will read
his commission. He will then take the Judicial Oath, to be adminis-
tered by the Clerk, after which the Marshal of the Court will escort
him to his seat on the Bench."
The Clerk then read the commission as follows:
"LYNDON B. JOHNSON,
"President of the United States of America,
"To All Who Shall See these Presents, Greeting:
"Know Ye; That reposing special trust and confidence in the Wis-
dom, Uprightness, and Learning of Thurgood Marshall of New York,
I have nominated, and, by and with the advice and consent of the
Senate, do appoint him Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of
the United States, and do authorize and empower him to execute and
fulfil the duties of that Office according to the Constitution and Laws
of the said United States, and to Have and to Hold the said Office,
with all the powers, privileges and emoluments to the same of right
appertaining, unto Him, the said Thurgood Marshall, during his good
behavior.
"In testimony whereof, I have caused these letters to be made patent
and the seal of the Department of Justice to be hereunto affixed.
"Done at the City of Washington this thirtieth day of August, in
the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and sixty-seven, and
300-278-67—1

of the Independence of the United States of America the one hun-
dred and ninety-second.
[SEAL]
"By the President:
"LYNDON B. JOHNSON.
"RAMSEY CLARK,
"Attorney General."
The oath of office was then administered by the Clerk, and Mr. Jus-
tice Marshall was escorted by the Marshal to his seat on the bench.
The oaths taken by Mr. Justice Marshall are in the following words,
viz:
“I, Thurgood Marshall, do solemnly swear that I will support and
defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, for-
eign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the

through the inconvenience and expense of arbitration
before they can obtain a binding decision that the arbi-
tration forum is in fact the proper one.
Since this gross
waste of time and effort is neither required by the ap-
plicable statutes nor consistent with fair and efficient
judicial procedure, I would grant certiorari and reverse.
The dispute over which tribunal should determine
the merits of this case arises in this way. Cunard, the
respondent, chartered a ship owned by petitioner and
also acted as stevedore in unloading the ship when it
reached New York. A longshoreman employee of Cunard
was injured during Cunard's stevedoring operation and
sued petitioner. the ship's owner. Petitioner owner then
claimed that Cunard was liable to indemnify it for any
damages it might have to pay Cunard's employee. If
the claim of indemnity is considered to be a dispute
arising under the charter contract, that contract governs
and the controversy must be arbitrated in London. If,
however, the controversy arises not under the Charter
but under the stevedore's warranty of workmanlike
service implied by law, Ryan Stevedoring Co. v. Pan-
Atlantic Steamship Corp., 350 U. S. 124 (1956), then
36A

the case must be tried by the District Court in New York.
The District Judge decided that the dispute arose under
the Charter and stayed the judicial proceedings pending
arbitration. The Court of Appeals, while expressing
considerable doubt as to whether arbitration was in fact
proper, nevertheless followed what it considered to be
the requirements of Schoenamsgruber v. Hamburg Line,
294 U. S. 454 (1935), and ruled that the District Judge's
order was not yet appealable. I think decent and expe-
ditious judicial procedure requires that the principles
governing appealability announced in Schoenamsgruber
be repudiated and that the Court of Appeals be held
obligated to determine the proper tribunal now, either
on the ground that the order is a "final" judgment and
appealable as such, 28 U. S. C. § 1291, or on the ground.
that it is an interlocutory decision amounting in all
substance and effect to an "injunction" and therefore
appealable under 28 U. S. C. § 1292 (a) (1).
"
Section 1292 (a)(1) permits appeals from "Interlocu-
tory orders. . . granting, continuing, modifying, refus-
ing or dissolving injunctions .
An order should
be appealable within the meaning of this statute if in
substantial effect it is equivalent to an injunction, and
as a matter of fact we have so held. Ettelson v. Metro-
politan Insurance Co., 317 U. S. 188 (1942). It is true
that some doubt has been cast on the Ettelson test by
City of Morgantown v. Royal Insurance Co., 337 U. S.
254 (1949), and Baltimore Contractors v. Bodinger, 348
U. S. 176 (1955). But these more recent cases have
introduced confusion and technicality into the law, re-
quiring resolution of this statutory question in terms of
the fiction of separate law, equity, and admiralty "sides"
of the United States District Court. I think the time
has come to abandon this outmoded fiction about "sides.
☐ of the Court" and return to the sound principles an-
nounced in Ettelson, supra. Here as in Ettelson plain-
tiffs are "in no different position than if a state equity

ERRATA
36c
court had restrained them from proceeding in [a] law
action." Ettelson, supra, 317 U. S., at 192. Since the
stay entered in this case was an injunction in every prac-
tical sense, I would hold that it was an injunction in
the statutory sense and allow the present appeal.
I also think this order was "final" within the meaning
of 28 U. S. C. § 1291. Our cases dealing with the mean-
ing of finality have provided no satisfactory definition
of this term, as this Court has itself repeatedly recog-
nized. McGourkey v. Toledo & Ohio Railway, 146 U. S.
536 (1892); Dickinson v. Petroleum Conversion Corp.,
338 U. S. 507 (1950). Certainly we have time and
again departed from the statement in Catlin v. United
States, 324 U. S. 229, 239 (1945), that the decision to be
final and appealable must be one which "leaves nothing
for the court to do but execute the judgment," and we
have held numerous orders final and appealable which
had left open major questions in litigation but were
nevertheless "in that small class which finally deter-
mine claims of right separable from, and collateral to,
rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied
review, and too independent of the cause itself to require
that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole
case is adjudicated." Cohen v. Beneficial Loan Corp.,
337 U. S. 541, 546 (1949). See also Roberts v. U. S.
District Court, 339 U. S. 844 (1950); Brown Shoe Co. v.
United States, 370 U. S. 294 (1962). The same practical
test of finality has been applied to determine whether
the judgment of a state court is "final" within the mean-
ing of 28 U. S. C. § 1257. Construction Laborers v.
Curry, 371 U. S. 542 (1963); Mercantile National Bank
v. Langdeau, 371 U. S. 555 (1963).
Accordingly, I do not regard as conclusive the fact
that in cases of this kind "[t] he parties are still before
the court and further proceedings may be moved after
the arbitrators have acted." Compare Lowry & Co. v.
S. S. Le Moyne D'Iberville, 372 F. 2d 123, 124 (C. A.

ERRATA
36D
2d Cir. 1967). The order in the present case stayed the
judicial proceedings petitioner had commenced in New
York and required the parties to go to London and con-
duct an arbitration that may prove costly and time
consuming. Under these circumstances the question
whether petitioner had a right to prompt determination
of his claim in a judicial forum is "too important to be
denied review and too independent of the cause itself
to require that appellate consideration be deferred until
the whole case is adjudicated." Cohen, supra. The
court below was correct, of course, in noting that if the
arbitration award proves satisfactory to petitioner, the
question of arbitrability will then be moot, but in that
event petitioner's right-if it has one-to avoid the costs
and inconveniences incident to a foreign arbitration will
have been irretrievably lost. It was this very danger
that was the controlling consideration in Cohen, supra,
337 U. S., at 546.
It is also true that postponing review will prove to
have been the more efficient approach if the District
Judge's ruling is ultimately affirmed. But the prob-
ability of such an outcome can never be assessed from
the present vantage point. There is at least a strong
possibility that when review is finally had, the ruling
will be found erroneous by the United States courts. In
that case it will be necessary to proceed at long last to
trial. At the moment all we can say is that we must
risk either an unnecessary appeal or an unnecessary
arbitration. The former may be somewhat bothersome
for the appellate courts, but the latter will be such a
serious burden for both the parties that I would unhesi-
tatingly choose to avoid it. I would grant the writ,
reverse the judgment below, and require a ruling now
on the only controversy between the parties that is ripe
for decision at this time should the case be arbitrated
or tried in court?

ERRATA
The following should be included at page 75 at the end.
of the paragraph dealing with No. 115:
MR. JUSTICE FORTAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS
joins, dissenting from the denial of certiorari.
A policeman saw petitioner seated in an improperly
parked car at 1:50 a. m. The policeman spoke to peti-
tioner, but received no reply. He detected a strong odor
of alcohol on petitioner's breath. He took petitioner
to a nearby police station. Petitioner requested permis-
sion to call an attorney. The request was refused. He
was questioned, but refused to answer. He said he would
answer questions "if he could call a lawyer."
According to the police, petitioner was unsteady on
his feet and his clothes were disarranged. No medical
or chemical test for drunkenness was administered to
petitioner or requested by him. Petitioner refused, in
the absence of counsel, to submit to the performance tests
routinely used by police in such cases.
Petitioner was placed in a cell. He was awakened at
7:05 a. m., signed a form to the effect that he had been
warned of his right to counsel, to remain silent and to
be free on bail. Ten minutes later, he telephoned his
attorney.
Petitioner was thereafter brought to trial before a judge
of the Seventh Circuit Court of Connecticut. He was
represented by counsel. He demanded and was denied
a jury trial. He also asserted that his rights under the
Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States
Constitution had been violated because he was denied
counsel at the time of his detention and examination at
75A

the police station. These claims were denied, and judg-
ment was entered that defendant was guilty of the crime
of being "found intoxicated." Gen. Stat. Conn. § 53–246.
The maximum penalty for this offense under Connec-
ticut law is a $20 fine or a jail sentence of 30 days, or
both. Petitioner was sentenced to a fine of $20 and a
jail sentence of 10 days. Execution of the jail sentence
was suspended. On appeal, the judgment was affirmed
by the Appellate Division of the Circuit Court of Con-
necticut (24 Conn. L. J. # 42), and a petition for certi-
fication to the Supreme Court of Connecticut was denied
by that court (24 Conn. L. J. # 34). A petition for cer-
tiorari was duly filed with this Court, limited to the
right-to-counsel question.
We should grant the petition. Sharply and clearly it
presents the following important questions: (1) Whether
a prosecution for being "found intoxicated," subjecting
the defendant to as much as 30 days imprisonment, is
within the category of serious state criminal prosecutions
to which the federal constitutional guarantee of assist-
ance of counsel applies, under the decisions of this Court.
See Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963);
(2) Whether, if the answer to this question is in the nega-
tive, we should now hold that the constitutional guar-
antee of counsel applies to the present case and to other
relatively "minor" offenses or misdemeanors carrying
significant penalties for their violation; and (3) Whether
denial of a request for counsel in the circumstances here
presented, after arrest and without reference to police
interrogation or to any admission by the accused, violates
the Constitution and invalidates a conviction.
In connection with this last point, we should consider
whether a person who is arrested and jailed is entitled
to telephone his lawyer and to consult with him, even
in the absence of a showing that denial of a request to
this effect has resulted in specific prejudice. In our
society, we reject the theory that the police may seize
and hold a citizen incommunicado. This is fundamental

ERRATA
75c
to our constitutional system. I would think that a
person, plucked from the streets and put in a cell, is
entitled as of right-to let his family know that he is
in jail and to call for assistance. Cf. Haynes v. Wash-
ington, 373 U. S. 503 (1963).
The present case, however, does not depend upon es-
tablishing an absolute right to call a lawyer after arrest.
Petitioner's lawyer, had petitioner's request to call him
been granted, might have performed an important func-
tion, which was not capable of performance five or six
hours later. He might have insisted upon medical or
chemical tests; he might have summoned a private physi-
cian. At the very least, he could have informed the
arrested person's family and friends that the accused had
not disappeared without a trace, but was held, safely if
unhappily, in jail.
In contrast with petitioner's need for an attorney is
the absence of any legitimate state interest in forbid-
ding petitioner to call one. I believe the issue thus posed
is both important and certain to recur.
I would grant
certiorari to resolve that issue now.

ERRATA
The following should be included at page 77 at the end
of the paragraph dealing with No. 163 Misc.:
MR. JUSTICE FORTAS, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE
and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS join, dissenting.
Petitioner was convicted of murder on the testimony
of William Triplett, an accomplice in the crime. The
prosecutor promised Triplett leniency if he testified
against the petitioner. Triplett, however, testified that
he had not been promised anything. The prosecutor
knew this testimony was false, and the jury heard Trip-
lett's entire testimony under the erroneous impression
that he had not received promises of leniency. Later in
the trial, and over the prosecutor's objection, petitioner
called Triplett's lawyer and the prosecutor as witnesses.
Both admitted that the prosecutor promised Triplett
leniency if he would testify.
I think this case is governed by the principle of Napue
v. Illinois, 360 U. S. 264 (1959).* It is true that in the
present case, the prosecutor was called by the defense
and compelled to admit that he offered leniency to the
*In response to a question by the prosecutor, a principal state
witness in Napue testified that he had received no promise of con-
sideration in return for his testimony. In fact, the prosecutor had
promised him consideration but did nothing to correct the false
testimony. Earlier, the witness had been forced by defense counsel
to admit that someone, tentatively described as a public defender,
"was going to do what he could" to help the witness. The Court
held that the prosecutor's knowing acquiescence in the witness' lie
deprived the defendant of a fair trial under the Fourteenth Amend-
ment even though the jury had been apprised that the witness may
have been lying about whether he had any interest in testifying.

77B
witness if he testified. So, here, the jury ultimately
knew not only that the witness lied, but also that the
prosecutor knew he was lying.
It may be that upon hearing the prosecutor's recanta-
tion, the jury could properly discount Triplett's testi-
mony. However, the jury heard him under the
impression that he was not receiving benefit for his testi-
mony, and the subsequent recantation by the prosecutor,
later in the trial, could not adequately overcome the
jury's initial impression of the testimony. Accordingly,
in these circumstances, we must conclude that petitioner
was prejudiced by the prosecutor's acquiescence in the
misrepresentation by his witness.
In any event, it is by no means clear that petitioner
must show that the prosecutor's knowing acquiescence
in a material falsehood prejudiced him. There is no place
in our system of criminal justice for prosecutorial miscon-
duct. See Giles v. Maryland, 386 U. S. 66 (1967) (opin-
ion of BRENNAN, J.); Miller v. Pate, 386 U. S. 1 (1967);
Napue v. Illinois, supra; Alcorta v. Texas, 355 U. S. 28
(1957); White v. Ragen, 324 U. S. 760 (1945); Pyle v.
Kansas, 317 U. S. 213 (1942); and Mooney v. Holohan,
294 U. S. 103 (1935). See also Giles v. Maryland, supra,
at 96 (opinion of FORTAS, J.); and Brady v. Maryland,
373 U. S. 83 (1963). Especially in a capital case, a false
denial by the critical State's witness that he was promised
leniency in return for his testimony, knowingly acquiesced
in by the prosecutor, requires reversal of a state convic-
tion, even though the prosecutor was later compelled to
admit that the denial was untrue.
I would grant certiorari and reverse. Napue v. Illinois,
supra.

The petitioner created six fiberglass statues which he
offered for sale in his backyard. Two police officers
approached his home, confiscated the statues, and ar-
rested him for violating a municipal ordinance that
prohibits the knowing possession of obscene figures or
images for sale.¹
The petitioner was convicted, his conviction was
affirmed, and the Florida District Court of Appeal de-
nied certiorari. Unable to obtain review in any higher
Florida court, he brought to this Court the federal
1 Section 38 of Chapter 43 of the Miami Code provides that it
shall be unlawful for any person to commit an act which is recog-
nized by the laws of the State as a misdemeanor. Under c. 61–7,
Laws 1961; Fla. Stat. § 847.011 (1) (a), it is a misdemeanor to have
in one's "possession, custody, or control with intent to sell . . any
obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, indecent, [or] immoral. . . figure
[or] image."
The Florida Supreme Court may review by certiorari a decision
of a district court of appeal "in direct conflict with a decision of
another district court of appeal or of the supreme court on the
same point of law." Fla. Const., Art. V, § 4 (2); Fla. App. R.
4.5c (6). Although the State suggests that the petitioner might
have invoked this "conflict jurisdiction" in order to obtain review
of his conviction in the Florida Supreme Court, the petitioner states
that no Florida decision of which he is aware conflicts with that of
the District Court of Appeal, and the State's response to the petition
for certiorari refers to no decision that even purports to pass upon
the issues here involved. Under these circumstances, I am satis-

constitutional claims he had unsuccessfully advanced
at every stage of the state litigation.
It is clear that the ordinance under which he was con-
victed is unconstitutional on its face. That ordinance
adopts the definition of obscenity embodied in a Florida
statute:
3
"For the purpose of this section, the test of whether
or not material is obscene is: Whether to the aver-
age person, applying contemporary community
standards, the dominant theme of the material taken
as a whole appeals to prurient interest."
Members of this Court have expressed differing views
as to the extent of a State's power to suppress "obscene"
material through criminal or civil proceedings. But it
is at least established that a State is without power to
do so upon the sole ground that the material "appeals
to prurient interest." 4
The petitioner in this case was charged, tried, and con-
victed under a statutory provision which contains no
fied that the judgment of the District Court of Appeal in this case
was "rendered by the highest court of a State in which a decision
could be had," as required by 28 U. S. C. § 1257.
3 Chapter 61-7, Laws 1961; Fla. Stat. § 847.011 (10).
4 The "prurient interest" language of the Florida statute may be
traced to a sentence in this Court's opinion in Roth v. United States,
354 U. S. 476, 489. That language, however, cannot be taken to
establish a constitutionally sufficient "test" of obscenity. The pre-
vailing opinion by MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN in Memoirs v. Massa-
chusetts, 383 U. S. 413, recognized that a State may not suppress-
matter as "obscene" unless "(a) the dominant theme of the material
taken as a whole appeals to a prurient interest in sex; (b) the ma-
terial is patently offensive because it affronts contemporary commu-
nity standards relating to the description or representation of sexual
matters; and (c) the material is utterly without redeeming social
value," stressing that the "three elements must coalesce." 383 U. S.,
at 418. MR. JUSTICE WHITE dissented in that case, nonetheless
expressing the opinion that a legislature is not free to ban workst
of art or literature "simply because they deal with sex or because
they appeal to the prurient interest." Id., at 462. See Redrup v.
New York, 386 U. S. 767.

The following should be included at page 94 at the end
of the paragraph dealing with No. 30 Misc.:
MR. JUSTICE FORTAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS
and MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL join, dissenting.
While petitioner was in custody on a murder charge, he
sent a note to an inspector in the District Attorney's
office requesting a meeting. The inspector met peti-
tioner in a room on the mezzanine of the county jail.
Faced with a possible death penalty,¹ petitioner said he
would give some information "if he were allowed to plead
guilty [before a certain judge] and receive a life sen-
tence." The inspector testified and recounted this offer
of compromise to the jury.2
1 Petitioner was charged with two counts of murder. At his first
trial he was sentenced to death on both counts. The California
Supreme Court reversed the conviction. People v. Hamilton, 55
Cal. 2d 881, 362 P. 2d 473 (1961). At his second trial he was found
guilty on both counts again and sentenced to death on one and life
imprisonment on the other. The California Supreme Court upheld
the convictions and the life sentence but reversed the death penalty.
People v. Hamilton, 60 Cal. 2d 105, 383 P. 2d 412 (1963). Subse-
quently, petitioner was sentenced to life imprisonment on both
counts. He filed two petitions for habeas corpus in the California
Supreme Court. Both were denied without opinion. This petition
for certiorari seeks review of the second denial.
2 At a subsequent point in the trial, petitioner's counsel read to
the jury a transcript of an interrogation of defendant by the police,
conducted on the night he was apprehended. In his statement peti-
tioner said he was going to "plead guilt" but that he "never intended
to kill neither one of them." The California Supreme Court did not
refer to this statement or rely upon it in determining that the admis-
sion of petitioner's offer to plead guilty made to the inspector almost
three months later was harmless error.
94A

t

94B
Before the inspector's evidence was introduced, but
while the inspector was on the stand, petitioner asked
for an offer of proof by the prosecutor out of the jury's
presence. The request was denied. Immediately after
the inspector told about the offer to plead guilty, peti-
tioner moved to strike the evidence. The motion was
denied.
It is not uncommon for defendants or their lawyers to
negotiate with prosecutors about pleading guilty. It is
entirely possible that, in the hopelessness and loneliness
of jail, faced with a charge of murder, a prisoner may
discuss a bargain-deal with the prosecutor even if he is
not guilty of the offense. In any event, the defendant's
attempt to negotiate may well be accepted by the jury
as a convincing admission of guilt. There is, in reality,
no way in which the jury can be persuaded that the ugly
inference of guilt is not to be drawn from his statement,
however equivocal may have been his intent in making it.
Usually, the accused cannot take the stand to explain the
circumstances without peril.
We should consider whether we should not, in any
event, prohibit the use of a statement made for bar-
gaining purposes. We should not attach such a penalty
to discussion of the possibility of a guilty plea. The
general rule is that such evidence would not be admissible
in a civil suit even where the stake is as little as a few
dollars. We should at least consider the bearing of
the practice upon the constitutional guarantee of a fair
trial where the issue is murder and the possible penalty is
death.*

Rule Civ. Proc. 68 and 7 Moore, Federal Practice §§ 68.01-68.06
(1966).
4 The California Supreme Court agreed that petitioner's offer to
plead guilty was inadmissible by analogy with a provision of the
California Code making inadmissible evidence of guilty pleas which
were withdrawn. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court held that this
was "harmless error" because it thought a different result would not

There is another important issue here. Although the
prosecutor used the offer to plead guilty as he would have
used a confession, there was no separate hearing on the
question of voluntariness. Nor did the trial judge make
a specific finding that the statement was voluntary. I
think we should consider whether the proceeding out-
lined in Jackson v. Denno, 378 U. S. 368 (1964), and
Sims v. Georgia, 385 U. S. 538 (1967), were required in
this case.
have been "reasonably probable" without the error. Therefore the
conviction was not reversed. People v. Hickman, 60 Cal. 2d, at
112-114, 119–121, 383 P. 2d, at 415-416, 420-421. The admission
of the evidence here in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment would
be critically important to the trial, and the error could not be con-
sidered harmless under the standards announced by the Court in.

ERRATA
The following should be included at page 103 at the end
of the paragraph dealing with No. 401:
MR. JUSTICE STEWART, with whom MR. JUSTICE
DOUGLAS joins, dissenting.
The petitioners were drafted into the United States
Army in late 1965, and six months later were ordered to
a West Coast replacement station for shipment to Viet-
nam. They brought this suit to prevent the Secretary
of Defense and the Secretary of the Army from carrying
out those orders, and requested a declaratory judgment
that the present United States military activity in Viet-
nam is "illegal." The District Court dismissed the suit,₁
and the Court of Appeals affirmed.²
There exist in this case questions of great magnitude.
Some are akin to those referred to by MR. JUSTICE
DOUGLAS in Mitchell v. United States, 386 U. S. 972.
But there are others:
I. Is the present United States military activity
in Vietnam a "war" within the meaning of
Article I, Section 8, Clause 11 of the
Constitution?
II. If so, may the Executive constitutionally order
the petitioners to participate in that military
activity, when no war has been declared by
the Congress?

III. Of what relevance to Question II are the present
treaty obligations of the United States?
IV. Of what relevance to Question II is the joint
Congressional ("Tonkin Bay") Resolution of
August 10, 1964?
(a) Do present United States military opera-
tions fall within the terms of the Joint
Resolution?
(b) If the Joint Resolution purports to give
the Chief Executive authority to commit
United States forces to armed conflict
limited in scope only by his own abso-
lute discretion, is the Resolution a con-
stitutionally impermissible delegation of
all or part of Congress' power to declare
war?
These are large and deeply troubling questions.
Whether the Court would ultimately reach them depends,
of course, upon the resolution of serious preliminary
issues of justiciability. We cannot make these problems
go away simply by refusing to hear the case of three
obscure Army privates. I intimate not even tentative
views upon any of these matters, but I think the Court
should squarely face them by granting certiorari and
setting this case for oral argument.

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE
STEWART concurs, dissenting.
The questions posed by MR. JUSTICE STEWART cover
the wide range of problems which the Senate Committee
on Foreign Relations recently explored,¹ in connection
with the SEATO Treaty of February 19, 1955,2 and the
Tonkin Gulf Resolution.³
Mr. Katzenbach, representing the Administration, tes-
tified that he did not regard the Tonkin Gulf Resolution
to be "a declaration of war" 4 and that while the Resolu-
tion was not "constitutionally necessary" it was "polit-
ically, from an international viewpoint and from a
domestic viewpoint, extremely important." 5 He added:6
"The use of the phrase 'to declare war' as it was
used in the Constitution of the United States had a
particular meaning in terms of the events and the
practices which existed at the time it was
adopted
"[I]t was recognized by the Founding Fathers
that the President might have to take emergency
action to protect the security of the United States,

but that if there was going to be another use of the
armed forces of the United States, that was a decision
which Congress should check the Executive on, which
Congress should support. It was for that reason
that the phrase was inserted in the Constitution.
"Now, over a long period of time, . . . there have
been many uses of the military forces of the United
States for a variety of purposes without a congres-
sional declaration of war. But it would be fair to
say that most of these were relatively minor uses of
force.
"A declaration of war would not, I think, cor-
rectly reflect the very limited objectives of the
United States with respect to Vietnam. It would
not correctly reflect our efforts there, what we are
trying to do, the reasons why we are there, to use
an outmoded phraseology, to declare war."
The view that Congress was intended to play a more
active role in the initiation and conduct of war than the
above statements might suggest has been espoused by
Senator Fulbright (Cong. Rec. Oct. 11, 1967, p. 14683-
14690), quoting Thomas Jefferson who said: "
"We have already given in example one effectual
check to the Dog of war by transferring the power
of letting him loose from the Executive to the Legis-
lative body, from those who are to spend to those
who are to pay."
15 Papers of Jefferson 397 (Boyd ed., Princeton 1955). In the
Federalist No. 69, at 465 (Cooke ed. 1961), Hamilton stated:
"The President is to be Commander in Chief of the army and
navy of the United States. In this respect his authority would be
nominally the same with that of the King of Great Britain, but in
substance much inferior to it. It would amount to nothing more
than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval
forces, as first General and Admiral of the Confederacy; while that
of the British King extends to the declaring of war and to the raising
and regulating of fleets and armies; all which by the Constitution
under consideration would appertain to the Legislature."

These opposed views are reflected in the Prize Cases,
2 Black 635, a five-to-four decision rendered in 1863.
Mr. Justice Grier, writing for the majority, emphasized
the arguments for strong presidential powers. Justice
Nelson, writing for the minority of four, read the Consti-
tution more strictly, emphasizing that what is war in
actuality may not constitute war in the constitutional
sense. During all subsequent periods in our history-
through the Spanish-American War, the Boxer Rebellion,
two World Wars, Korea, and now Vietnam-the two
points of view urged in the Prize Cases have continued
to be voiced.
A host of problems is raised. Does the President's
authority to repel invasions and quiet insurrections, his
powers in foreign relations and his duty to execute faith-
fully the laws of the United States, including its treaties,
justify what has been threatened of petitioners? What
is the relevancy of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution and
the yearly appropriations in support of the Vietnam
effort?
The London Treaty (59 Stat. 1546), the SEATO
Treaty (6 U. S. T. 81, 1955), the Kellogg-Briand Pact
(46 Stat. 2343), and Article 39 of Chapter VII of the
UN Charter deal with various aspects of wars of
"aggression."
Do any of them embrace hostilities in Vietnam, or
give rights to individuals affected to complain, or in
other respects give rise to justiciable controversies?
There are other treaties or declarations that could be
cited. Perhaps all of them are wide of the mark. There
are sentences in our opinions which, detached from their
context, indicate that what is happening is none of
our business:
"Certainly it is not the function of the Judiciary
to entertain private litigation-even by a citizen―
which challenges the legality, the wisdom, or the

ERRATA
103F
propriety of the Commander-in-Chief in sending our
armed forces abroad or to any particular region."
Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U. S. 763, 789.
We do not, of course, sit as a committee of oversight or
supervision. What resolutions the President asks and
what the Congress provides are not our concern. With
respect to the Federal Government, we sit only to decide
actual cases or controversies within judicial cognizance
that arise as a result of what the Congress or the Presi-
dent or a judge does or attempts to do to a person or
his property.
In Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 1, the Court relieved a
person of the death penalty imposed by a military tri-
bunal, holding that only a civilian court had power to
try him for the offense charged. Speaking of the purpose
of the Founders in providing constitutional guarantees,
the Court said:
"They knew. . . the nation they were founding, be
its existence short or long, would be involved in war;
how often or how long continued, human foresight.
could not tell; and that unlimited power, wherever
lodged at such a time, was especially hazardous to
freemen. For this, and other equally weighty rea-
sons, they secured the inheritance they had fought to
maintain, by incorporating in a written constitution
the safeguards which time had proved were essential
to its preservation. Not one of these safeguards can
the President, or Congress, or the Judiciary disturb,
except the one concerning the writ of habeas corpus."
Id., 125.
The fact that the political branches are responsible for
the threat to petitioners' liberty is not decisive. As
Mr. Justice Holmes said in Nixon v. Herndon, 273
U. S. 536, 540:
"The objection that the subject matter of the
suit is political is little more than a play upon words.
Of course the petition concerns political action but

it alleges and seeks to recover for private damage.
That private damage may be caused by such political
action and may be recovered for in a suit at law
hardly has been doubted for over two hundred years,
since Ashby v. White, 2 Ld. Raym. 938, 3 id. 320,
and has been recognized by this Court."
These petitioners should be told whether their case
is beyond judicial cognizance. If it is not, we should
then reach the merits of their claims, on which I intimate-
no views whatsoever.

ERRATA
The following should be included at page 122 at the end
of the paragraph dealing with No. 197:
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN, dissenting.
This is no ordinary case. It is of utmost importance
to millions of investors, and concerns practices which
have an impact on the entire economy of the Nation.
It presents for consideration basic principles of antitrust
law not previously decided by this Court, and, conse-
quently, is not controlled by precedent. It comes here
without representation of the public interest by an
agency charged with enforcement of the antitrust laws.
This case draws into question the legality under the
Sherman Act of the practice of the New York Stock
Exchange in adopting rules fixing minimum rates for the
commissions charged by Exchange members for the pur-
chase and sale of securities on the Exchange. Petitioners
brought this action pursuant to § 4 of the Clayton Act,
15 U. S. C. § 15, derivatively on behalf of five mutual
fund investment companies of which they are share-
holders and representatively on behalf of other share-
holders against the New York Stock Exchange and five
of its member firms. Their complaint charges that the
practice of the Exchange in fixing minimum commission
rates for transactions in securities listed on the Exchange
constitutes a price-fixing conspiracy under $1 of the
Sherman Act, 15 U. S. C. § 1. They sought treble dam-
ages, a declaratory judgment, and an injunction, the
effect of which would be to restrain the Exchange from
interfering with the rights of individual Exchange mem-
bers to set their own competitive rates of commission.
122A

ERRATA
122B
The District Court granted summary judgment for the
Exchange and member firms. The Court of Appeals for
the Seventh Circuit affirmed.
Members of the New York Stock Exchange transact
over 90% of all brokerage business in stocks in the
United States. Based on the current trading volume,
the investing public is now paying over $1,200,000,000
annually, at the uniform minimum rate, for the privilege
of trading on the Exchange. More than 12,000,000
persons own shares listed on the Exchange. Mutual
investment funds pay about $100,000,000 annually in
commissions to trade on the Exchange, and over 3,000,000
persons own shares in mutual funds.
Only members can trade on the New York Stock Ex-
change, and its constitution severely limits membership.
Exchange rules set uniform minimum commission rates
to be charged by members for transactions on the Ex-
change. The same commission rate is charged, based.
on the value of the round lot (100 shares), for each
transaction regardless of size; the commission on an
order for 10,000 shares is 100 times that on an order for
100 shares. Commission rules prohibit any "member,
allied member, member firm or member corporation"
from making "a proposition for the transaction of busi-
ness at less than the minimum rates of commission."
Before a member is allowed trading privileges he must
sign a pledge to abide by the constitution and rules of
the Exchange, and any member or allied member
adjudged guilty of violating the constitution or a rule
may be suspended or expelled by the Board of Governors.
This Court has long held that rates fixed by agreement
are unreasonable per se. United States v. National Assn.
of Real Estate Boards, 339 U. S. 485, 489 (1950); United
States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U. S. 150, 218
(1940); United States v. Trenton Potteries Co., 273 U. S.
392, 396–398 (1927). Therefore, the Exchange practice
here attacked, just as that in Silver v. New York Stock

ERRATA
122c
Exchange, 373 U. S. 341 (1963), would, "had it occurred
in a context free from other federal regulation, constitute
a per se violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act." Id., at
347. Here, as in Silver, the other federal regulatory
scheme is the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the
clear question presented is whether there is anything
"built into the regulatory scheme which performs the
antitrust function . . . . Id., at 358.
"
Section 19 (b) (9) of the Securities Exchange Act, 15
U. S. C. § 78s (b) (9), authorizes the SEC by certain pro-
cedures "to alter or supplement the rules" of the Ex-
change "in respect of such matters as . . the fixing of
reasonable rates of commission . . . ." Respondents con-
tend that this provision sufficiently demonstrates the SEC
performs a supervisory function in respect of the Ex-
change's rate-fixing to exempt the practice from review
under the antitrust laws. Petitioners claim that for
many reasons the possibility of SEC review is an insuffi-
cient substitute for application of the antitrust laws.
For example, the SEC's review of rates is discretionary.
Further, the regulatory scheme not only fails specifically
to enjoin the SEC, in determining what rates are reason-
able, to "enforce the competitive standard," United
States v. Philadelphia National Bank, 374 U. S. 321, 351
(1963), but also neither the SEC nor the Exchange has
ever articulated any standard of reasonableness. Peti-
tioners also claim that the underlying data used by the
SEC in reviewing each of the five rate increases since
1934 have been essentially those supplied by the Ex-
change, and have been very limited in scope and content.
Finally, they claim that if and when the SEC exercises
its discretion to review rates, it is not required to hold
a hearing, and because the matter is committed to the
SEC's discretion, there is no effective judicial remedy to
require it to initiate a rate proceeding.
If, as petitioners claim, the regulatory scheme pro-
vides no assurance that antitrust policy will be imple-

ERRATA
122D
mented, perhaps a repeal of the antitrust law may be
implied "if necessary to make the Securities Exchange
Act work, and even then only to the minimum extent
necessary." Silver v. New York Stock Exchange, supra,
at 357. However, "repeals of the antitrust laws by
implication from a regulatory statute are strongly dis-
favored." United States v. Philadelphia National Bank,
supra, at 350. Moreover, petitioners claim that nothing
about the Securities Exchange Act or the workings of
the Exchange requires that the Exchange set minimum
rates.
The court below, in a two-page opinion, held that a.
repeal of the antitrust laws was required to make the Se-
curities Exchange Act work, and that "the self-regulatory
function of the exchange has been exercised by virtue
of § 19 (b)." In my view, this blunderbuss approach
falls far short of the close analysis and delicate weighing
process mandated by this Court's opinion in Silver.
The importance of the New York Stock Exchange in
the functioning and livelihood of this Nation cannot be
gainsaid. Ever-increasing millions of persons and billions
of dollars are effected by the Exchange's practices. With-
out expressing any final view on the merits of the con--
troversy, I am concerned that the law on this subject
is to be permitted to lie where it has aimlessly fallen by
virtue of the scanty opinion below. In my judgment,
the claims advanced by petitioners raise important ques-
tions not only as to the compatibility of the Exchange's:
rate-fixing practice with this Nation's commitment,
embodied in the antitrust laws, to competitive pricing,.
but also as to the fulfillment of the goal of investor pro-
tection embodied in the securities laws.
I would grant certiorari and invite the Solicitor Gen--
eral to participate in argument so that the public interest
may be fully explored.

The following should be included at page 137 at the end
of the paragraph dealing with No. 145:
MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN, dissenting.
This is an important case affecting the rights of mil-
lions of workers to vindicate their reputations and to
make a living in the military-private industrial complex.
See Greene v. McElroy, 360 U. S. 474, 507, n. 31 (1959).
According to petitioners, this case presents the follow-
ing question:
"Is a government contractor endowed with the
attributes of a Federal Agency and is it and are its
employees clothed with unqualified or absolute priv-
ilege to falsely and maliciously defame other employ-
ees in reporting a loss, compromise, or suspected
compromise of classified information, solely by rea-
son of (1) having contracted with the United States
Government to furnish it with supplies or services
which are required and necessary to the National
Defense, and (2) in connection therewith having
entered into a security agreement with the United
States Government under the terms of which it has
agreed to report the loss, compromise, or suspected
compromise of classified information." Petition for
Cert., p. 2.
Petitioners brought this action against respondent
Philco Corporation, their employer, for an alleged defa-
mation made in a report to the Department of Defense
under the terms of a contract for the manufacture of
defense items. The complaint alleged that the report
contained both false and malicious statements concerning
137A

ERRATA
137B
petitioners and resulted in the withdrawal of their secur-
ity clearances and thus the loss of their jobs. On respond-
ent's motion for summary judgment, the District Court
dismissed the complaint, holding the communication
absolutely privileged. 234 F. Supp. 10 (D. C. E. D. Va.
1964). Placing unjustified reliance on the authority of
the principal opinion in Barr v. Matteo, 360 U. S. 564
(1959), the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit
affirmed. 372 F. 2d 771 (C. A. 4th Cir. 1967). In grant-
ing an absolute privilege to government employees at the
expense of the individual's right to be free from defama-
tion, Barr v. Matteo extended the earlier decisions of this
Court to what I and others considered to be the breaking
point. That opinion did not command a majority of this
Court then, and only one of those who joined it is on this
Court today. The conclusion there was reached by
balancing
". . . on the one hand, the protection of the indi-
vidual citizen against pecuniary damage caused by
oppressive or malicious action on the part of officials
of the Federal Government; and on the other, the
protection of the public interest by shielding respon-
sible governmental officers against the harassment
and inevitable hazards of vindictive or ill-founded
damages suits brought on account of action taken in
the exercise of their official responsibilities."
v. Matteo, supra, at 565.
Barr
The deprivation of the employee's rights in the present
case is justified in the following manner: By Executive
Order, the Secretary of Defense is empowered through
regulations to safeguard classified information." Pur-
suant to that power, the Secretary has issued an Indus-
trial Security Manual which requires contractors to pro-
tect all classified information by maintaining a system of
1 Exec. Order No. 10,865, 3 CFR 1959-1963 Comp., p. 398, as
amended by Exec. Order No. 10,909, 3 CFR 1959-1963 Comp., p. 437.

137c
security controls and to report any loss, compromise, or
suspected compromise of that information to the Depart-
ment of Defense.2 The Secretary enters into a Security
agreement with his contractors to implement the provi-
sions of the Manual. The Secretary does not attempt
to clothe the contractor with any immunity from a civil
action for damages caused by defamatory reports.
From this scheme to protect classified information, the
court below took the additional and unwarranted step
of conferring an absolute privilege on the corporation.
"So it was that the company and such of its
employees as were confidants were answerable for
keeping the nation's secrets, as fully as if they were
governed by the oath of a Federal official. Closely
performing his duties and charged with equal
2 The Department of Defense Industrial Manual for Safeguarding
Classified Information provides in part:

"The contractor shall submit immediately to the cognizant security
officer-
"(b) A report, classified if approproate, of any loss, compromise
or suspected compromise of classified information.
"14. Loss, Compromise or Suspected Compromise of Classified
Information
(d) In the event of loss, compromise, or suspected compromise of
classified information outside of a facility the contractor shall estab-
lish procedures requiring that the person discovering the loss,
compromise or suspected compromise shall immediately―
"(1) Notify the local office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
and furnish sufficient information to assist in identification of the
information (if the loss, compromise or suspected compromise occurs
outside of the United States, the nearest United States authorities
shall be notified in lieu of the Federal Bureau of Investigation); and
"(2) Report the loss to the contractor by the fastest means of
communication.
"(e) The military department assigned security cognizance shall.
conduct such further inquiry as may be required."

responsibility and loyalty, we think the company
and its trusted personnel were imbued with the
official's character, and partake of his immunity to
liability, whenever and wherever he would enjoy the
absolute privilege." 372 F. 2d 771, 774.
No authority is quoted for this statement for the obvious
reason that there is none.
I do not cast any doubt on the general powers of the
Secretary of Defense in safeguarding classified informa-
tion, nor on the Executive Order, nor on the Industrial
Manual, nor on the Security Agreement entered into in
this case. None of these are pertinent to our decision.
Nor is the truth or falsity of the allegation that Philco
maliciously or falsely defamed the petitioners of any
relevance. All the case involves is whether a private
corporation under a security agreement with the Gov-
ernment is entitled to an absolute privilege to report with
"actual malice" information to the Government that
results in the deprivation of the worker's employment
and reputation.
3
We have not granted to private citizens a blanket
immunity from legal liability for defaming public offi-
cials. Instead, we have held that a public official may
recover for defamatory falsehoods relating to his official
conduct if he can prove the statement was made with
"actual malice." New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376
U. S. 254 (1964). I can see absolutely no justification
for granting to a corporation contracting with the Gov-
ernment a greater privilege to defame than we have
accorded to private citizens in commenting upon the
conduct of public officials. This seems to me to be a
complete inversion of First Amendment rights. A quali-
fied privilege is clearly sufficient in both situations to
protect the paramount public interest in the free flow
of information.
3 However, since this is a summary judgment, we are required to
take the allegations of the complaint as true.

ERRATA
137E
I disagreed with Barr v. Matteo, but even in that case
it was said there were "other sanctions than civil tort.
suits available to deter the executive official" from mak-
ing defamatory statements in press releases. 360 U. S.
564, 576. None of those "other sanctions" are present
in the instant case. While a defamatory press release
might subject the government official to both public
censure and internal discipline from his superiors, the
secrecy surrounding Philco's communication insulates
the defamer from such sanctions. Since the Department
of Defense has no disciplinary power over the employees
of a private corporation for defamatory statements, in-
ternal sanctions are unlikely. It will also be much more
difficult for the Department of Defense to recognize a
malicious and false libel prepared by a private concern
doing business with the Government. It follows then
that even assuming, arguendo, that internal reports made-
by a governmental employee to his superior should have
an absolute privilege since the superior will be able to
evaluate the accuracy of a statement concerning condi
tions within his own department, this does not justify
extending the privilege to communications from private
corporations. Thus, the privilege has been conferred in
this case without the normal concomitants of such pro-
tection, leaving the employee's reputation highly vulner-
able to injury by a corporate executive who has no direct
responsibility to the public.
It is difficult for me to understand why the importance.
of this case is not apparent to the Court. Personally,
I cannot contenance this indiscriminate extension of Barr-
v. Matteo. I would grant certiorari and invite the Gov-
ernment to make known its opinion of what the national
interest might be.

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting.
I agree with THE CHIEF JUSTICE that this is an impor-
tant case which warrants the attention of the Court.
It puts into focus several important issues, among them
an aspect of the modern corporation which has become
vital in the Federal Government's procurement program.
Professor Galbraith has referred to it in his recent book
The New Industrial State:
"Increasingly it will be recognized that the mature
corporation, as it develops, becomes part of the larger
administrative complex associated with the state.
In time the line between the two will disappear.
Men will look back in amusement at the pretense
that once caused people to refer to General Dy-
namics and North American Aviation and A. T. & T.
as private business.
"Though this recognition will not be universally
welcomed, it will be healthy. There is always a
presumption in social matters in favor of reality as
opposed to myth. The autonomy of the techno-
structure is, to repeat yet again, a functional neces-
sity of the industrial system. But the goals this
autonomy serves allow some range of choice. If
the mature corporation is recognized to be part of
the penumbra of the state, it will be more strongly
in the service of social goals. It cannot plead its
inherently private character or its subordination to
the market as cover for the pursuit of different goals

137G
of particular interest to itself. The public agency
has an unquestioned tendency to pursue goals that
reflect its own interest and convenience and to adapt
social objective thereto. But it cannot plead this
as a superior right. There may well be danger in

it is less if it is recognized." Id., at 393–394.
I think the time has come for us to explore this
problem; and the setting of the present case shows how-
pressing the problem is.

The following should be included at page 138 at the end
of the paragraph dealing with No. 483:
MR. JUSTICE BLACK, dissenting.
I would grant certiorari here and reverse the action of
the District Court and the Court of Appeals for render-
ing a summary judgment against petitioners in flagrant
disregard of the right to trial by jury guaranteed by the
Seventh Amendment to the Constitution. The case
arose in this way. Two children riding in a car were
killed in a collision with a bus. The car was driven by
one Clark, who was protected by a policy of liability
insurance issued by the respondent, American Universal
Insurance Company. The insurance company undertook
the defense of Clark in a suit for damages brought by
petitioners on behalf of the deceased children. Clark
claimed that the lawyer for the insurance company
conducted his defense in bad faith and assigned to
petitioners his claim for damages against the company.
During the settlement negotiations prior to the suit-
against Clark and the bus company, the insurance com-
pany lawyer urged lack of actionable negligence by Clark,
and Clark later testified (in depositions taken in relation
to the present action) that he went to trial with the under-
standing that his defense would be lack of negligence.
On the day of trial of the action for damages against
Clark a lawyer appeared for the insurance company and
filed an amended answer in which the lawyer-on behalf
of his client Clark-asserted the defense of assumption
138A

ERRATA
138B
of risk, charging that the deceased children had known
Clark was drunk and should not have ridden with him.
The insurance company lawyer never discussed with his
client Clark the alternative defenses available to him or
the significance of the filing of the amended complaint.
Indeed Clark was never even advised of the fact that an
amended complaint had been filed, in which he was
pleading his own drunkenness in an effort to escape
liability for damages. As the Court of Appeals noted
in the present case, no satisfactory explanation has ever
been offered for these omissions. At trial, the lawyer
not only abandoned the position that the accident had
been caused solely by the negligence of the bus driver but
made every effort to put Clark in the worst possible light.
He offered evidence that Clark had been speeding and
had gone through a stop sign at the intersection, and in
his summation he urged the jury to disbelieve his own
client's testimony to to the contrary. In addition, he
permitted Clark's guilty plea in a related criminal action
to be introduced without objection, and he gave Clark
no opportunity to explain it. This was contrary to a
specific agreement between insurance company counsel.
and Clark's personal lawyer (who did not take part in
the trial of the civil case). The general tenor of this
so-called "defense" is indicated by the insurance com-
pany lawyer's closing argument to the jury:
"I have attempted to prove that this young man
was drunk when he was driving that car on Saturday
night, the 15th of April. I have attempted to prove
that he was operating it recklessly, and that doesn't
sound like a lawyer on a man's side to try to prove
his own client is drunk, does it?
•
"[N]o one has come to this boy's aid and told you
that he stopped at that stop sign.
David
Oursler gave a statement and he said, 'I am sure
Michael didn't stop.' These things I knew and they

ERRATA
138c
convinced me, as they must you, that this young
man was at fault in the accident.
"The thing is bothering me worse than anything
else in trying to defend him was a judgment of the
Jefferson Circuit Court. Right here across the street
Judge Knight entered a judgment, for this young
man in person, being charged with wilful, felonious,
negligent, reckless, careless and wanton operation
of an automobile, . . . and there in person [Clark]
pleaded guilty to that offense.
[T]his young
man was found guilty of negligent homicide. Now
presented with that situation, believing as I do be-
lieve, I felt then and I feel now that a jury of
twelve honest people is going to reach the conclusion
that this young man, by witnesses and by his own
admissions, caused this accident."
•
This defense was theoretically in Clark's interest since
it purported to offer him hope of avoiding liability
entirely. But it was a dangerous defense for Clark since
if the jury refused to charge the plaintiffs with assump-
tion of the risk, the damages would certainly be higher-
and the amount apportioned against Clark rather than
against the bus company would certainly be greater-
than if the no-negligence defense had been attempted.
The company's interest, however, was obviously different
since from its point of view the assumption of risk
approach had no disadvantages. Its liability was limited
to $10,000 under the policy and if the strategy inflated
the damages above this figure, Clark would be responsible
to pay the additional amount out of his own pocket.
I agree with the courts below that this a cause of action
created by the law of Kentucky, and I accept the finding
that under the law of Kentucky bad faith "is not simply
bad judgment. It is not merely negligence. ... It
implies conscious doing of wrong. . . . It partakes of
the nature of fraud." Harrod v. Meridian Mutual Insur-

ance Co., 389 S. W. 2d 74, 76 (Ky. 1964). The basis
for my disagreement is that I cannot see how this evi-
dence of bad faith on the part of the insurance company
lawyer can be considered insufficient to make a case for
the jury.
This record establishes for me a rather convincing case
of bad faith; at the very least I think a jury of 12
ordinary men, with a common-sense understanding of
such matters, could reasonably conclude that the insur-
ance company's conduct in this case amounted to con-
scious wrongdoing. By ordering summary judgment for
the defendant, the courts below simply imposed their
own notions as to the most plausible inference to be
drawn from this record, thereby denying the plaintiffs.
their constitutionally protected right to have their case
decided by 12 ordinary citizens.

ORDER
ORDERED: 1. That the following rules, to be known as the Federal
Rules of Appellate Procedure, be, and they hereby are, prescribed,
pursuant to sections 3771 and 3772 of Title 18, United States Code, and

MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1967
145
sections 2072 and 2075 of Title 28, United States Code, to govern the
procedure in appeals to United States courts of appeals from the
United States district courts, in the review by United States courts of
appeals of decisions of the Tax Court of the United States, in proceed-
ings in the United States courts of appeals for the review or enforce-
ment of orders of administrative agencies, boards, commissions and
officers, and in applications for writs or other relief which a United
States court of appeals or judge thereof is competent to give:
FEDERAL RULES OF APPELLATE PROCEDURE
TITLE I. APPLICABILITY OF RULES
Rule 1. Scope of rules
(a) Scope of rules. These rules govern procedure in appeals to
United States courts of appeals from the United States district courts
and the Tax Court of the United States; in proceedings in the courts
of appeals for review or enforcement of orders of administrative
agencies, boards, commissions and officers of the United States; and in
applications for writs or other relief which a court of appeals or a
judge thereof is competent to give.
(b) Rules not to affect jurisdiction. These rules shall not be con-
strued to extend or limit the jurisdiction of the courts of appeals as
established by law.
Rule 2. Suspension of rules
In the interest of expediting decision, or for other good cause shown,
a court of appeals may, except as otherwise provided in Rule 26 (b),
suspend the requirements or provisions of any of these rules in a
particular case on application of a party or on its own motion and
may order proceedings in accordance with its direction.
TITLE II. APPEALS FROM JUDGMENTS AND ORDERS OF DISTRICT COURTS
Rule 3. Appeal as of right-How taken
(a) Filing the notice of appeal. An appeal permitted by law as of
right from a district court to a court of appeals shall be taken by filing
a notice of appeal with the clerk of the district court within the time
allowed by Rule 4. Failure of an appellant to take any step other than
the timely filing of a notice of appeal does not affect the validity of
the appeal, but is ground only for such action as the court of appeals
deems appropriate, which may include dismissal of the appeal. Ap-
peals by permission under 28 U.S.C. § 1292 (b) and appeals by allow-
ance in bankruptcy shall be taken in the manner prescribed by Rule 5
and Rule 6, respectively.
300-278-67-

MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1967

(6) Joint or consolidated appeals. If two or more persons are en-
titled to appeal from a judgment or order of a district court and their
interests are such as to make joinder practicable, they may file a joint
notice of appeal, or may join in appeal after filing separate timely
notices of appeal, and they may thereafter proceed on appeal as a
single appellant. Appeals may be consolidated by order of the court
of appeals upon its own motion or upon motion of a party, or by
stipulation of the parties to the several appeals.
(c) Content of the notice of appeal. The notice of appeal shall spec-
ify the party or parties taking the appeal; shall designate the judg-
ment, order, or part thereof appealed from; and shall name the court
to which the appeal is taken. Form 1 in the Appendix of Forms is a
suggested form of a notice of appeal.
(d) Service of the notice of appeal. The clerk of the district court
shall serve notice of the filing of a notice of appeal by mailing a copy
thereof to counsel of record of each party other than the appellant, or,
if a party is not represented by counsel, to the party at his last known
address; and in criminal cases, habeas corpus proceedings, or proceed-
ings under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, the clerk shall mail a copy of the notice
of appeal and of the docket entries to the clerk of the court of appeals
named in the notice. When an appeal is taken by a defendant in a
criminal case, the clerk shall also serve a copy of the notice of appeal
upon him, either by personal service or by mail addressed to him.
The clerk shall note on each copy served the date on which the notice
of appeal was filed. Failure of the clerk to serve notice shall not affect
the validity of the appeal. Service shall be sufficient notwithstanding
the death of a party or his counsel. The clerk shall note in the docket
the names of the parties to whom he mails copies, with the date of
mailing.
Rule 4. Appeal as of right-When taken
(a) Appeals in civil cases. In a civil case (including a civil action
which involves an admiralty or maritime claim and a proceeding in
bankruptcy or a controversy arising therein) in which an appeal is
permitted by law as of right from a district court to a court of appeals
the notice of appeal required by Rule 3 shall be filed with the clerk
of the district court within 30 days of the date of the entry of the
judgment or order appealed from; but if the United States or an
officer or agency thereof is a party, the notice of appeal may be filed
by any party within 60 days of such entry. If a timely notice of appeal
is filed by a party, any other party may file a notice of appeal within
14 days of the date on which the first notice of appeal was filed, or
within the time otherwise prescribed by this subdivision, whichever
period last expires.
The running of the time for filing a notice of appeal is terminated
as to all parties by a timely motion filed in the district court by any

MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1967
147
party pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure hereafter
enumerated in this sentence, and the full time for appeal fixed by this
subdivision commences to run and is to be computed from the entry of
any of the following orders made upon a timely motion under such
rules: (1) granting or denying a motion for judgment under Rule
50(b); (2) granting or denying a motion under Rule 52(b) to amend
or make additional findings of fact, whether or not an alteration of
the judgment would be required if the motion is granted; (3) granting
or denying a motion under Rule 59 to alter or amend the judgment;
(4) denying a motion for a new trial under Rule 59. A judgment or
order is entered within the meaning of this subdivision when it is
entered in the civil docket.
Upon a showing of excusable neglect, the district court may extend
the time for filing the notice of appeal by any party for a period not
to exceed 30 days from the expiration of the time otherwise prescribed
by this subdivision. Such an extension may be granted before or after
the time otherwise prescribed by this subdivision has expired; but if a
request for an extension is made after such time has expired, it shall
be made by motion with such notice as the court shall deem appro-
priate.
(b) Appeals in criminal cases. In a criminal case the notice of ap-
peal by a defendant shall be filed in the district court within 10 days
after the entry of the judgment or order appealed from. A notice of
appeal filed after the announcement of a decision, sentence or order but
before entry of the judgment or order shall be treated as filed after
such entry and on the day thereof. If a timely motion in arrest of judg-
ment or for a new trial on any ground other than newly discovered
evidence has been made, an appeal from a judgment of conviction
may be taken within 10 days after the entry of an order denying the
motion. A motion for a new trial based on the ground of newly dis-
covered evidence will similarly extend the time for appeal from a judg-
ment of conviction if the motion is made before or within 10 days after
entry of the judgment. When an appeal by the government is author-
ized by statute, the notice of appeal shall be filed in the district court
within 30 days after the entry of the judgment or order appealed from.
A judgment or order is entered within the meaning of this subdivision
when it is entered in the criminal docket. Upon a showing of excusable
neglect the district court may, before or after the time has expired,
with or without motion and notice, extend the time for filing a notice
of appeal for a period not to exceed 30 days from the expiration of the
time otherwise prescribed by this subdivision.
Rule 5. Appeals by permission under 28 U.S.C. § 1292 (b)
(a) Petition for permission to appeal. An appeal from an interlocu-
tory order containing the statement prescribed by 28 U.S.C. § 1292 (b)
may be sought by filing a petition for permission to appeal with the

MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1967
148
clerk of the court of appeals within 10 days after the entry of such
order in the district court with proof of service on all other parties to
the action in the district court. An order may be amended to include the
prescribed statement at any time, and permission to appeal may be
sought within 10 days after entry of the order as amended.
(b) Content of petition; answer. The petition shall contain a state-
ment of the facts necessary to an understanding of the controlling
question of law determined by the order of the district court; a state-
ment of the question itself; and a statement of the reasons why a
substantial basis exists for a difference of opinion on the question and
why an immediate appeal may materially advance the termination of
the litigation. The petition shall include or have annexed thereto a
copy
of the order from which appeal is sought and of any findings of
fact, conclusions of law and opinion relating thereto. Within 7 days
after service of the petition an adverse party may file an answer in
opposition. The application and answer shall be submitted without
oral argument unless otherwise ordered.
(c) Form of papers; number of copies. All papers may be typewrit-
ten. Three copies shall be filed with the original, but the court may
require that additional copies be furnished.
(d) Grant of permission; cost bond; filing of record. If permission
to appeal is granted the appellant shall file a bond for costs as required
by Rule 7, within 10 days after entry of the order granting permission
to appeal, and the record shall be transmitted and filed and the appeal
docketed in accordance with Rules 11 and 12. The time fixed by those
rules for transmitting the record and docketing the appeal shall run
from the date of the entry of the order granting permission to appeal.
A notice of appeal need not be filed.
Rule 6. Appeals by allowance in bankruptcy proceedings
(a) Petition for allowance. Allowance of an appeal under section 24
of the Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C. § 47) from orders, decrees, or
judgments of a district court involving less than $500, or from an
order making or refusing to make allowances of compensation or re-
imbursement under sections 250 or 498 thereof (11 U.S.C. § 650, § 898)
shall be sought by filing a petition for allowance with the clerk of the
court of appeals within the time provided by Rule 4(a) for filing a
notice of appeal, with proof of service on all parties to the action in
the district court. A notice of appeal need not be filed.
(b) Content of petition; answer. The petition shall contain a state-
ment of the facts necessary to an understanding of the questions to be
presented by the appeal; a statement of those questions and of the
relief sought; a statement of the reasons why in the opinion of the
petitioner the appeal should be allowed; and a copy of the order,
decree or judgment complained of and of any opinion or memorandum
relating thereto. Within 7 days after service of the petition an adverse

MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1967
149
party may file an answer in opposition. The petition and answer shall
be submitted without oral argument unless otherwise ordered.
(c) Form of papers; number of copies. All papers may be type-
written. Three copies shall be filed with the original, but the court
may require that additional copies be furnished.
(d) Allowance of the appeal; cost bond; filing of record. If the
appeal is allowed the appellant shall file a bond for costs as required
by Rule 7, within 10 days of the entry of the order granting permission
to appeal, and the record shall be transmitted and filed and the appeal
docketed in accordance with Rules 11 and 12. The time fixed by those
rules for transmitting the record and docketing the appeal shall run
from the date of the entry of the order allowing the appeal. A notice
of appeal need not be filed.
Rule 7. Bond for costs on appeal in civil cases
Unless an appellant is exempted by law, or has filed a supersedeas
bond or other undertaking which includes security for the payment
of costs on appeal, in civil cases a bond for costs on appeal or equivalent
security shall be filed by the appellant in the district court with the no-
tice of appeal; but security shall not be required of an appellant who is
not subject to costs. The bond or equivalent security shall be in the
sum or value of $250 unless the district court fixes a different amount.
A bond for costs on appeal shall have sufficient surety, and it or any
equivalent security shall be conditioned to secure the payment of costs
if the appeal is finally dismissed or the judgment affirmed, or of such
costs as the court of appeals may direct if the judgment is modified.
If a bond or equivalent security in the sum or value of $250 is given,
no approval thereof is necessary. After a bond for costs on appeal is
filed, an appellee may rise for determination by the clerk of the
district court objections to the form of the bond or to the sufficiency
of the surety. The provisions of Rule 8(b) apply to a surety upon
a bond given pursuant to this rule.
Rule 8. Stay or injunction pending appeal
(a) Stay must ordinarily be sought in the first instance in district
court; motion for stay in court of appeals. Application for a stay of the
judgment or order of a district court pending appeal, or for approval
of a supersedeas bond, or for an order suspending, modifying, restor-
ing or granting an injunction during the pendency of an appeal must
ordinarily be made in the first instance in the district court. A motion
for such relief may be made to the court of appeals or to a judge
thereof, but the motion shall show that application to the district court.
for the relief sought is not practicable, or that the district court has
denied an application, or has failed to afford the relief which the
applicant requested, with the reasons given by the district court for its
action. The motion shall also show the reasons for the relief requested
300-278-67-34

MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1967
150
and the facts relied upon, and if the facts are subject to dispute the
motion shall be supported by affidavits or other sworn statements or
copies thereof. With the motion shall be filed such parts of the record
as are relevant. Reasonable notice of the motion shall be given to all
points. The motion shall be filed with the clerk and normally will be
considered by a panel or division of the court, but in exceptional
cases where such procedure would be impracticable due to the require-
ments of time, the application may be made to and considered by a
single judge of the court.
(b) Stay may be conditioned upon giving of bond; proceedings
against sureties. Relief available in the court of appeals under this rule
may be conditioned upon the filing of a bond or other appropriate
security in the district court. If security is given in the form of a bond
or stipulation or other undertaking with one or more sureties, each
surety submits himself to the jurisdiction of the district court and ir-
revocably appoints the clerk of the district court as his agent upon
whom any papers affecting his liability on the bond or undertaking
may be served. His liability may be enforced on motion in the district
court without the necessity of an independent action. The motion and
such notice of the motion as the district court prescribes may be served
on the clerk of the district court, who shall forthwith mail copies to the
sureties if their addresses are known.
(c) Stays in criminal cases. Stays in criminal cases shall be had in
accordance with the provisions of Rule 38(a) of the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure.
Rule 9. Release in criminal cases
(a) Appeals from orders respecting release entered prior to a judg-
ment of conviction. An appeal authorized by law from an order refus-
ing or imposing conditions of release shall be determined promptly.
Upon entry of an order refusing or imposing conditions of release,
the district court shall state in writing the reasons for the action
taken. The appeal shall be heard without the necessity of briefs after
reasonable notice to the appellee upon such papers, affidavits, and por-
tions of the record as the parties shall present. The court of appeals or
a judge thereof may order the release of the appellant pending the
appeal.
(b) Release pending appeal from a judgment of conviction. Appli-
cation for release after a judgment of conviction shall be made in the
first instance in the district court. If the district court refuses release
pending appeal, or imposes conditions of release, the court shall state
in writing the reasons for the action taken. Thereafter, if an appeal is
pending, a motion for release, or for modification of the conditions of
release, pending review may be made to the court of appeals or to a
judge thereof. The motion shall be determined promptly upon such
papers, affidavits, and portions of the record as the parties shall pre-

MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1967
151
sent and after reasonable notice to the appellee. The court of appeals or
a judge thereof may order the release of the appellant pending dis-
position of the motion.
Rule 10. The record on appeal
(a) Composition of the record on appeal. The original papers and
exhibits filed in the district court, the transcript of proceedings, if
any, and a certified copy of the docket entries prepared by the clerk
of the district court shall constitute the record on appeal in all cases.
(b) The transcript of proceedings; duty of appellant to order; notice
to appellee if partial transcript is ordered. Within 10 days after filing
the notice of appeal the appellant shall order from the reporter a
transcript of such parts of the proceedings not already on file as he
deems necessary for inclusion in the record. If the appellant intends
to urge on appeal that a finding or conclusion is unsupported by the
evidence or is contrary to the evidence, he shall include in the record.
a transcript of all evidence relevant to such finding or conclusion.
Unless the entire transcript is to be included, the appellant shall,
within the time above provided, file and serve on the appellee a descrip-
tion of the parts of the transcript which he intends to include in the
record and a statement of the issues he intends to present on the appeal.
If the appellee deems a transcript of other parts of the proceedings to
be necessary he shall, within 10 days after the service of the statement
of the appellant, file and serve on the appellant a designation of addi-
tional parts to be included. If the appellant shall refuse to order such
parts, the appellee shall either order the parts or apply to the district
court for an order requiring the appellant to do so. At the time of
ordering, a party must make satisfactory arrangements with the re-
porter for payment of the cost of the transcript.
(c) Statement of the evidence or proceedings when no report was
made or when the transcript is unavailable. If no report of the evidence
or proceedings at a hearing or trial was made, or if a transcript is
unavailable, the appellant may prepare a statement of the evidence or
proceedings from the best available means, including his recollection.
The statement shall be served on the appellee, who may serve objec-
tions or propose amendment thereto within 10 days after service. There-
upon the statement and any objections or proposed amendments shall
be submitted to the district court for settlement and approval and as
settled and approved shall be included by the clerk of the district court
in the record on appeal.
(d) Agreed statement as the record on appeal. In lieu of the record
on appeal as defined in subdivision (a) of this rule, the parties may
prepare and sign a statement of the case showing how the issues pre-
sented by the appeal arose and were decided in the district court and
setting forth only so many of the facts averred and proved or sought to
be proved as are essential to a decision of the issued presented. If the

MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1967
152
statement conforms to the truth, it, together with such additions as
the court may consider necessary fully to present the issues raised by
the appeal, shall be approved by the district court and shall then be
certified to the court of appeals as the record on appeal and trans-
mitted thereto by the clerk of the district court within the time pro-
vided by Rule 11. Copies of the agreed statement may be filed as the
appendix required by Rule 30.
(e) Correction or modification of the record. If any difference arises
as to whether the record truly discloses what occurred in the district
court, the difference shall be submitted to and settled by that court and
the record made to conform to the truth. If anything material to either
party is omitted from the record by error or accident or is misstated
therein, the parties by stipulation, or the district court, either before or
after the record is transmitted to the court of appeals, or the court of
appeals, on proper suggestion or of its own initiative, may direct that
the omission or misstatement be corrected, and if necessary that a
supplemental record be certified and transmitted. All other questions
as to the form and content of the record shall be presented to the
court of appeals.
Rule 11. Transmission of the record
(a) Time for transmission; duty of appellant. The record on ap-
peal, including the transcript and exhibits necessary for the determi-
nation of the appeal, shall be transmitted to the court of appeals
within 40 days after the filing of the notice of appeal unless the time
is shortened or extended by an order entered under subdivision (d)
of this rule. After filing the notice of appeal the appellant shall com-
ply with the provisions of Rule 10(b) and shall take any other action
necessary to enable the clerk to assemble and transmit the record. If
more than one appeal is taken, each appellant shall comply with the
provisions of Rule 10(b) and this subdivision, and a single record
shall be transmitted within 40 days after the filing of the final notice
of appeal.
(b) Duty of clerk to transmit the record. When the record is com-
plete for purposes of the appeal, the clerk of the district court shall
transmit it to the clerk of the court of appeals. The clerk of the district
court shall number the documents comprising the record and shall
transmit with the record a list of the documents correspondingly num-
bered and identified with reasonable definiteness. Documents of un-
usual bulk or weight and physical exhibits other than documents shall
not be transmitted by the clerk unless he is directed to do so by a party
or by the clerk of the court of appeals. A party must make advance
arrangements with the clerks for the transportation and receipt of
exhibits of unsual bulk or weight.
Transmission of the record is effected when the clerk of the district
court mails or otherwise forwards the record to the clerk of the court
1
al
1

MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1967
153
of appeals. The clerk of the district court shall indicate, by endorsement
on the face of the record or otherwise, the date upon which it is trans-
mitted to the court of appeals.
(c) Temporary retention of record in district court for use in pre-
paring appellate papers. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivi-
sions (a) and (b) of this rule, the parties may stipulate, or the district
court on motion of any party may order, that the clerk of the district
court shall temporarily retain the record for use by the parties in pre-
paring appellate papers. In that event, the appellant shall neverthe-
less cause the appeal to be docketed and the record to be filed within
the time fixed or allowed for transmission of the record by complying
with the provisions of Rule 12(a) and by presenting to the clerk of
the court of appeals a partial record in the form of a copy of the docket
entries, accompanied by a certificate of counsel for the appellant, or of
the appellant if he is without counsel, reciting that the record, in-
cluding the transcript or parts thereof designated for inclusion and all
necessary exhibits, is complete for purposes of the appeal. Upon receipt
of the brief of the appellee, or at such earlier time as the parties may
agree or the court may order, the appellant shall request the clerk of
the district court to transmit the record.
(d) Extension of time for transmission of the record; reduction of
time. The district court for cause shown may extend the time for trans-
mitting the record. A request for extension must be made within the
time originally prescribed or within an extension previously granted,
and the district court shall not extend the time to a day more than 90
days from the date of filing of the first notice of appeal. If the district
court is without authority to grant the relief sought or has denied a
request therefor, the court of appeals may on motion for cause shown
extend the time for transmitting the record or may permit the record
to be transmitted and filed after the expiration of the time allowed or
fixed. If a request for an extension of time for transmitting the record
has been previously denied, the motion shall set forth the denial and
shall state the reasons therefor, if any were given. The district court
or the court of appeals may require the record to be transmitted and
the appeal to be docketed at any time within the time otherwise fixed
or allowed therefor.
(e) Retention of the record in the district court by order of court.
The court of appeals may provide by rule or order that a certified copy
of the docket entries shall be transmitted in lieu of the entire record,
subject to the right of any party to request at any time during the
pendency of the appeal that designated parts of the record be trans-
mitted.
If the record or any part thereof is required in the district court for
use there pending the appeal, the district court may make an order
300-278-67-
-35

MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1967
154
to that effect, and the clerk of the district court shall retain the record
or parts thereof subject to the request of the court of appeals, and shall
transmit a copy of the order and of the docket entries together with
such parts of the original record as the district court shall allow and
copies of such parts as the parties may designate.
(f) Stipulation of parties that parts of the record be retained in
the district court. The parties may agree by written stipulation filed
in the district court that designated parts of the record shall be re-
tained in the district court unless thereafter the court of appeals shall
order or any party shall request their transmittal. The parts thus
designated shall nevertheless be a part of the record on appeal for all
purposes.
(g) Record for preliminary hearing in the court of appeals. If
prior to the time the record is transmitted a party desires to make in
the court of appeals a motion for dismissal, for release, for a stay
pending appeal, for additional security on the bond on appeal or on a
supersedeas bond, or for any intermediate order, the clerk of the dis-
trict court at the request of any party shall transmit to the court of
appeals such parts of the original record as any party shall designate.
Rule 12. Docketing the appeal; filing of the record
(a) Docketing the appeal. Within the time allowed or fixed for
transmission of the record, the appellant shall pay to the clerk of the
court of appeals the docket fee fixed by the Judicial Conference of the
United States pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1913, and the clerk shall there-
upon enter the appeal upon the docket. If an appellant is authorized to
prosecute the appeal without prepayment of fees, the clerk shall enter
the appeal upon the docket at the request of a party or at the time of
filing the record. The court of appeals may upon motion for cause
shown enlarge the time for docketing the appeal or permit the appeal
to be docketed out of time. An appeal shall be docketed under the title
given to the action in the district court, with the appellant identified as
such, but if such title does not contain the name of the appellant, his
name, identified as appellant, shall be added to the title.
(b) Filing of the record. Upon receipt of the record or of papers
authorized to be filed in lieu of the record under the provisions of
Rule 11 (c) and (e) by the clerk of the court of appeals following
timely transmittal, and after the appeal has been timely docketed, the
clerk shall file the record. The clerk shall immediately give notice
to all parties of the date on which the record was filed.
(c) Dismissal for failure of appellant to cause timely transmission
or to docket appeal. If the appellant shall fail to cause timely trans-
mission of the record or to pay the docket fee if a docket fee is required,
any appellee may file a motion in the court of appeals to dismiss the
appeal. The motion shall be supported by a certificate of the clerk of
the district court showing the date and substance of the judgment or

MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1967
155
order from which the appeal was taken, the date on which the notice
of appeal was filed, the expiration date of any order extending the
time for transmitting the record, and by proof of service. The appel-
lant may respond within 14 days of such service. The clerk shall docket
the appeal for the purpose of permitting the court to entertain the
motion without requiring payment of the docket fee, but the appellant
shall not be permitted to respond without payment of the fee unless he
is otherwise exempt therefrom.
TITLE III. REVIEW OF DECISIONS OF THE TAX COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Rule 13. Review of decisions of the Tax Court
(a) How obtained; time for filing notice of appeal. Review of a
decision of the Tax Court of the United States shall be obtained by
filing a notice of appeal with the clerk of the Tax Court within 90 days
after the decision of the Tax Court is entered. If a timely notice of
appeal is filed by one party, any other party may take an appeal by
filing a notice of appeal within 120 days after the decision of the
Tax Court is entered.
The running of the time for appeal is terminated as to all parties
by a timely motion to vacate or revise a decision made pursuant to the
Rules of Practice of the Tax Court. The full time for appeal com-
mences to run and is to be computed from the entry of an order dis-
posing of such motion, or from the entry of decision, whichever is
later.
(b) Notice of appeal-How filed. The notice of appeal may be filed
by deposit in the office of the clerk of the Tax Court in the District
of Columbia or by mail addressed to the clerk. If a notice is delivered
to the clerk by mail and is received after expiration of the last day
allowed for filing, the postmark date shall be deemed to be the date of
delivery, subject to the provisions of § 7502 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1954, as amended, and the regulations promulgated pursuant
thereto.
(c) Content of the notice of appeal; service of the notice; effect of
filing and service of the notice. The content of the notice of appeal, the
manner of its service, and the effect of the filing of the notice and of its
service shall be as prescribed by Rule 3. Form 2 in the Appendix of
Forms is a suggested form of the notice of appeal.
(d) The record on appeal; transmission of the record; filing of the
record. The provisions of Rules 10, 11 and 12 respecting the record and
the time and manner of its transmission and filing and the docketing
of the appeal in the court of appeals in cases on appeal from the district
courts shall govern in cases on appeal from the Tax Court. Each refer-
ence in those rules and in Rule 3 to the district court and to the clerk
of the district court shall be read as a reference to the Tax Court and

MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1967
156
to the clerk of the Tax Court respectively. If appeals are taken from
a decision of the Tax Court to more than one court of appeals, the
original record shall be transmitted to the court of appeals named in
the first notice of appeal filed. Provision for the record in any other
appeal shall be made upon appropriate application by the appellant to
the court of appeals to which such other appeal is taken.
Rule 14. Applicability of other rules to review of decisions of the Tax
Court
All provisions of these rules are applicable to review of a decision
of the Tax Court, except that Rules 4-9, Rules 15-20, and Rules 22 and
23 are not applicable.
TITLE IV. REVIEW AND ENFORCEMENT OF ORDERS OF ADMINISTRATIVE
AGENCIES, BOARDS, COMMISSIONS AND OFFICERS
Rule 15. Review or enforcement of agency orders-How obtained;
intervention
(a) Petition for review of order; joint petition. Review of an order
of an adminstrative agency, board, commission or officer (hereinafter,
the term "agency" shall include agency, board, commission or officer)
shall be obtained by filing with the clerk of a court of appeals which
is authorized to review such order, within the time prescribed by law,
a petition to enjoin, set aside, suspend, modify or otherwise review,
or a notice of appeal, whichever form is indicated by the applicable
statute (hereinafter, the term "petition for review" shall include a
petition to enjoin, set aside, suspend, modify or otherwise review, or
a notice of appeal). The petition shall specify the parties seeking re-
view and shall designate the respondent and the order or part thereof
to be reviewed. Form 3 in the Appendix of Forms is a suggested form
of a petition for review. In each case the agency shall be named re-
spondent. The United States shall also be deemed a respondent if so
required by statute, even though not so designated in the petition. If
two or more persons are entitled to petition the same court for review
of the same order and their interests are such as to make joinder
practicable, they may file a joint petition for review and may there-
after proceed as a single petitioner.
(b) Application for enforcement of order; answer; default; cross-
application for enforcement. An application for enforcement of an
order of an agency shall be filed with the clerk of a court of appeals
which is authorized to enforce the order. The application shall contain
a concise statement of the proceedings in which the order was entered,
the facts upon which venue is based, and the relief prayed. Within 20
days after the application is filed, the respondent shall serve on the
petitioner and file with the clerk an answer to the application. If the

MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1967
157
respondent fails to file an answer within such time, judgment will be
awarded for the relief prayed. If a petition is filed for review of an
order which the court has jurisdiction to enforce, the respondent may
file a cross-application for enforcement.
(c) Service of petition or application. A copy of a petition for
review or of an application or cross-application for enforcement of an
order shall be served by the clerk of the court of appeals on each
respondent in the manner prescribed by Rule 3(d), unless a different
manner of service is prescribed by an applicable statute. At the time
of filing, the petitioner shall furnish the clerk with a copy of the peti-
tion or application for each respondent. At or before the time of filing
a petition for review, the petitioner shall serve a copy thereof on all
parties who shall have been admitted to participate in the proceedings
before the agency other than respondents to be served by the clerk, and
shall file with the clerk a list of those so served.
(d) Intervention. Unless an applicable statute provides a differ-
ent method of intervention, a person who desires to intervene in a
proceeding under this rule shall serve upon all parties to the proceed-
ing and file with the clerk of the court of appeals a motion for leave
to intervene. The motion shall contain a concise statement of the inter-
est of the moving party and the grounds upon which intervention is
sought. A motion for leave to intervene or other notice of intervention
authorized by an applicable statute shall be filed within 30 days of the
date on which the petition for review is filed.
Rule 16. The record on review or enforcement
(a) Composition of the record. The order sought to be reviewed
or enforced, the findings or report on which it is based, and the plead-
ings, evidence and proceedings before the agency shall constitute the
record on review in proceedings to review or enforce the order of an
agency.
(b) Omissions from or misstatements in the record. If anything
material to any party is omitted from the record or is misstated therein,
the parties may at any time supply the omission or correct the mis-
statement by stipulation, or the court may at any time direct that
the omission or misstatement be corrected and, if necessary, that a
supplemental record be prepared and filed.
Rule 17. Filing of the record
(a) Agency to file; time for filing; notice for filing. The agency
shall file the record with the clerk of the court of appeals within 40
days after service upon it of the petition for review unless a different
time is provided by the statute authorizing review. In enforcement pro-
ceedings the agency shall file the record within 40 days after filing an
application for enforcement, but the record need not be filed unless
the respondent has filed an answer contesting enforcement of the order,

MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1967
158
or unless the court otherwise orders. The court may shorten or extend
the time above prescribed. The clerk shall give notice to all parties of
the date on which the record is filed.
(b) Filing What constitutes. The agency may file the entire record
or such parts thereof as the parties may designate by stipulation filed
with the agency. The original papers in the agency proceeding or
certified copies thereof may be filed. Instead of filing the record or
designated parts thereof, the agency may file a certified list of all
documents, transcripts of testimony, exhibits and other material com-
prising the record, or a list of such parts thereof as the parties may
designate, adequately describing each, and the filing of the certified
list shall constitute filing of the record. The parties may stipulate that
neither the record nor a certified list be filed with the court. The stipu-
lation shall be filed with the clerk of the court of appeals and the date
of its filing shall be deemed the date on which the record is filed. If
a certified list is filed, or if the parties designate only parts of the
record for filing or stipulate that neither the record nor a certified list
be filed, the agency shall retain the record or parts thereof. Upon re-
quest of the court or the request of a party, the record or any part
thereof thus retained shall be transmitted to the court nowithstanding
any prior stipulation. All parts of the record retained by the agency
shall be a part of the record on review for all purposes.
Rule 18. Stay pending review
Application for a stay of a decision or order of an agency pending
direct review in the court of appeals shall ordinarily be made in the
first instance to the agency. A motion for such relief may be made to
the court of appeals or to a judge thereof, but the motion shall show
that application to the agency for the relief sought is not practicable,
or that application has been made to the agency and denied, with the
reasons given by it for denial, or that the action of the agency did not
afford the relief which the applicant had requested. The motion shall
also show the reasons for the relief requested and the facts relied
upon, and if the facts are subject to dispute the motion shall be sup-
ported by affidavits or other sworn statements or copies thereof. With
the motion shall be filed such parts of the record as are relevant to
the relief sought. Reasonable notice of the motion shall be given to
all parties to the proceeding in the court of appeals. The court may
condition relief under this rule upon the filing of a bond or other ap-
propriate security. The motion shall be filed with the clerk and nor-
mally will be considered by a panel or division of the court, but in
exceptional cases where such procedure would be impracticable due to
the requirements of time, the application may be made to and con-
sidered by a single judge of the court.

MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1967
Rule 19. Settlement of judgments enforcing orders
159
When an opinion of the court is filed directing the entry of a judg-
ment enforcing in whole or in part the order of an agency, the agency
shall within 14 days thereafter serve upon the respondent and file with
the clerk a proposed judgment in conformity with the opinion. If the
respondent objects to the proposed judgment as not in conformity with
the opinion, he shall within 7 days thereafter serve upon the agency
and file with the clerk a proposed judgment which he deems to be in
conformity with the opinion. The court will thereupon settle the judg-
ment and direct its entry without further hearing or argument.
Rule 20. Applicability of other rules to review or enforcement of
agency orders
All provisions of these rules are applicable to review or enforce-
ment of orders of agencies, except that Rules 3-14 and Rules 22 and 23
are not applicable. As used in any applicable rule, the term "appellant"
includes a petitioner and the term “appellee" includes a respondent in
proceedings to review or enforce agency orders.
TITLE V. EXTRAORDINARY WRITS
Rule 21. Writs of mandamus and prohibition directed to a judge or
judges and other extraordinary writs
(a) Mandamus or prohibition to a judge or judges; petition for
writ; service and filing. Application for a writ of mandamus or of pro-
hibition directed to a judge or judges shall be made by filing a petition
therefor with the clerk of the court of appeals with proof of service on
the respondent judge or judges and on all parties to the action in the .
trial court. The petition shall contain a statement of the facts necessary
to an understanding of the issues presented by the application; a
statement of the issues presented and of the relief sought; a statement
of the reasons why the writ should issue; and copies of any order or
opinion or parts of the record which may be essential to an under-
standing of the matters set forth in the petition. Upon receipt of the
prescribed docket fee, the clerk shall docket the petition and submit it
to the court.
(b) Denial; order directing answer. If the court is of the opinion
that the writ should not be granted, it shall deny the petition. Other-
wise, it shall order that an answer to the petition be filed by the re-
spondents within the time fixed by the order. The order shall be served
by the clerk on the judge or judges named respondents and on all other
parties to the action in the trial court. All parties below other than
the petitioner shall also be deemed respondents for all purposes. Two
or more respondents may answer jointly. If the judge or judges named
respondents do not desire to appear in the proceeding, they may so
advise the clerk and all parties by letter, but the petition shall not

MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1967
160
thereby be taken as admitted. The clerk shall advise the parties of the
dates on which briefs are to be filed, if briefs are required, and of the
date of oral argument. The proceeding shall be given preference over
ordinary civil cases.
(c) Other extraordinary writs. Application for extraordinary writs
other than those provided for in subdivisions (a) and (b) of this rule
shall be made by petition filed with the clerk of the court of appeals
with proof of service on the parties named as respondents. Proceedings
on such application shall conform, so far as is practicable, to the pro-
cedure prescribed in subdivisions (a) and (b) of this rule.
(d) Form of papers; number of copies. All papers may be type-
written. Three copies shall be filed with the original, but the court may
direct that additional copies be furnished.
TITLE VI. HABEAS CORPUS; PROCEEDINGS IN FORMA PAUPERIS
Rule 22. Habeas corpus proceedings
(a) Application for the original writ. An application for a writ of
habeas corpus shall be made to the appropriate district court. If appli-
cation is made to a circuit judge, the application will ordinarily be
transferred to the appropriate district court. If an application is made
to or transferred to the district court and denied, renewal of the ap-
plication before a circuit judge is not favored; the proper remedy is
by appeal to the court of appeals from the order of the district court
denying the writ.
(b) Necessity of certificate of probable cause for appeal. In a habeas
corpus proceeding in which the detention complained of arises out of
process issued by a state court, an appeal by the applicant for the writ
may not proceed unless a district or a circuit judge issues a certificate
of probable cause. If an appeal is taken by the applicant, the district
judge who rendered the judgment shall either issue a certificate of
probable cause or state the reasons why such a certificate shall not
issue. The certificate or the statement shall be forwarded to the court
of appeals with the notice of appeal and the file of the proceedings in
the district court. If the district judge has denied the certificate, the
applicant for the writ may then request issuance of the certificate by a
circuit judge. If such a request is addressed to the court of appeals, it
shall be deemed addressed to the judges thereof and shall be considered
by a circuit judge or judges as the court deems appropriate. If no ex-
press request for a certificate is filed, the notice of appeal shall be
deemed to constitute a request addressed to the judges of the court of
appeals. If an appeal is taken by a state or its representative, a certifi-
cate of probable cause is not required.

MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1967
Rule 23. Custody of prisoners in habeas corpus proceedings
161
(a) Transfer of custody pending review. Pending review of a deci-
sion in a habeas corpus proceedings commenced before a court, justice
or judge of the United States for the release of a prisoner, a person
having custody of the prisoner shall not transfer custody to another
unless such transfer is directed in accordance with the provisions of
this rule. Upon application of a custodian showing a need therefor, the
court, justice or judge rendering the decision may make an order
authorizing transfer and providing for the substitution of the succes-
sor custodian as a party.
(b) Detention or release of prisoner pending review of decision
failing to release. Pending review of a decision failing or refusing to
release a prisoner in such a proceeding, the prisoner may be detained in
the custody from which release is sought, or in other appropriate
custody, or may be enlarged upon his recognizance, with or without
surety, as may appear fitting to the court or justice or judge rendering
the decision, or to the court of appeals or to the Supreme Court, or to
a judge or justice of either court.
(c) Release of prisoner pending review of decision ordering release.
Pending review of a decision ordering the release of a prisoner in
such a proceeding, the prisoner shall be enlarged upon his recognizance,
with or without surety, unless the court or justice or judge rendering
the decision, or the court of appeals or the Supreme Court, or a judge
or justice of either court shall otherwise order.
(d) Modification of initial order respecting custody. An initial
order respecting the custody or enlargement of the prisoner and any
recognizance of surety taken, shall govern review in the court of ap-
peals and in the Supreme Court unless for special reasons shown to the
court of appeals or to the Supreme Court, or to a judge or justice of
either court, the order shall be modified, or an independent order
respecting custody, enlargement or surety shall be made.
Rule 24. Proceedings in forma pauperis
(a) Leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis from district
court to court of appeals. A party to an action in a district court who
desires to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis shall file in the district
court a motion for leave so to proceed, together with an affidavit show-
ing, in the detail prescribed by Form 4 of the Appendix of Forms, his
inability to pay fees and costs or to give security therefor, his belief
that he is entitled to redress, and a statement of the issues which he
intends to present on appeal. If the motion is granted, the party may
proceed without further application to the court of appeals and with-
out prepayment of fees or costs in either court or the giving of security
therefor. If the motion is denied, the district court shall state in writ-
ing the reasons for the denial.

MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1967
162
Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding paragraph, a party
who has been permitted to proceed in an action in the district court in
forma pauperis, or who has been permitted to proceed there as one who
is financially unable to obtain an adequate defense in a criminal case,
may proceed on appeal in forma pauperis without further authoriza-
tion unless, before or after the notice of appeal is filed, the district
court shall certify that the appeal is not taken in good faith or shall
find that the party is otherwise not entitled so to proceed, in which
event the district court shall state in writing the reasons for such cer-
tification or finding.
If a motion for leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis is
denied by the district court, or if the district court shall certify that the
appeal is not taken in good faith or shall find that the party is other-
wise not entitled to proceed in forma pauperis, the clerk shall forth-
with serve notice of such action. A motion for leave so to proceed may
be filed in the court of appeals within 30 days after service of notice of
the action of the district court. The motion shall be accompanied by a
copy of the affidavit filed in the district court, or by the affidavit pre-
scribed by the first paragraph of this subdivision if no affidavit has
been filed in the district court, and by a copy of the statement of rea-
sons given by the district court for its action.
(b) Leave to proceed on appeal or review in forma pauperis in ad-
ministrative agency proceedings. A party to a proceeding before an
administrative agency, board, commission or officer (including, for the
purpose of this rule, the Tax Court of the United States) who desires
to proceed on appeal or review in a court of appeals in forma pauperis,
when such appeal or review may be had directly in a court of appeals,
shall file in the court of appeals a motion for leave so to proceed, to-
gether with the affidavit prescribed by the first paragraph of sub-
division (a) of this rule.
(c) Form of briefs, appendices and other papers. Parties allowed
to proceed in forma pauperis may file briefs, appendices and other
papers in typewritten form, and may request that the appeal be heard.
on the original record without the necessity of reproducing parts
thereof in any form.
TITLE VII. GENERAL PROVISIONS
Rule 25. Filing and service
(a) Filing. Papers required or permitted to be filed in a court of
appeals shall be filed with the clerk. Filing may be accomplished by
mail addressed to the clerk, but filing shall not be timely unless the
papers are received by the clerk within the time fixed for filing, except
that briefs and appendices shall be deemed filed on the day of mailing
if the most expeditious form of delivery by mail, excepting special

MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1967
163
delivery, is utilized. If a motion requests relief which may be granted
by a single judge, the judge may permit the motion to be filed with
him, in which event he shall note thereon the date of filing and shall
thereafter transmit it to the clerk.
(b) Service of all papers required. Copies of all papers filed by any
party and not required by these rules to be served by the clerk shall, at
or before the time of filing, be served by a party or person acting for
him on all other parties to the appeal or review. Service on a party
represented by counsel shall be made on counsel.
(c) Manner of service. Service may be personal or by mail. Per-
sonal service includes delivery of the copy to a clerk or other respon-
sible person at the office of counsel. Service by mail is complete on
mailing.
(d) Proof of service. Papers presented for filing shall contain an
acknowledgment of service by the person served or proof of service
in the form of a statement of the date and manner of service and
of the names of the person served, certified by the person who made
service. Proof of service may appear on or be affixed to the papers.
filed. The clerk may permit papers to be filed without acknowledg-
ment or proof of service but shall require such to be filed promptly
thereafter.
Rule 26. Computation and extension of time
(a) Computation of time. In computing any period of time pre-
scribed by these rules, by an order of court, or by any applicable
statute, the day of the act, event, or default from which the desig-
nated period of time begins to run shall not be included. The last day
of the period shall be included, unless it is a Saturday, Sunday or
a legal holiday, in which event the period extends until the end of the
next day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday. When
the period of time prescribed or allowed is less than 7 days, inter-
mediate Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays shall be excluded in the
computation. As used in this rule "legal holiday" includes New Year's
Day, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence Day,
Labor Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day, and
any other day appointed as a holiday by the President or the Con-
gress of the United States. It shall also include a day appointed as
a holiday by the state wherein the district court which rendered
the judgment or order which is or may be appealed from is situated,
or by the state wherein the principal office of the clerk of the court
of appeals in which the appeal is pending is located.
(b) Enlargement of time. The court for good cause shown may
upon motion enlarge the time prescribed by these rules or by its order
for doing any act, or may permit an act to be done after the expiration
of such time; but the court may not enlarge the time for filing a notice
of appeal, a petition for allowance, or a petition for permission to

MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1967
164
appeal. Nor may the court enlarge the time prescribed by law for filing
a petition to enjoin, set aside, suspend, modify, enforce or otherwise
review, or a notice of appeal from, an order of an administrative
agency, board, commission or officer of the United States, except as
specifically authorized by law.
(c) Additional time after service by mail. Whenever a party is re-
quired or permitted to do an act within a prescribed period after serv-
ice of a paper upon him and the paper is served by mail, 3 days shall
be added to the prescribed period.
Rule 27. Motions
(a) Content of motions; response; reply. Unless another form is
elsewhere prescribed by these rules, an application for an order or other
relief shall be made by filing a motion for such order or relief with
proof of service on all other parties. The motion shall contain or be
accompanied by any matter required by a specific provision of these
rules governing such a motion, shall state with particularity the
grounds on which it is based, and shall set forth the order or relief
sought. If a motion is supported by briefs, affidavits or other papers,
they shall be served and filed with the motion. Any party may file a
response in opposition to a motion other than one for a procedural
order [for which see subdivision (b)] within 7 days after service of
the motion, but motions authorized by Rules 8, 9, 18 and 41 may be
acted upon after reasonable notice, and the court may shorten or ex-
tend the time for responding to any motion.
(b) Determination of motions for procedural orders. Notwithstand-
ing the provisions of the preceding paragraph as to motions generally,
motions for procedural orders, including any motion under Rule 26 (b)
may be acted upon at any time, without awaiting a response thereto.
Any party adversely affected by such action may request reconsidera-
tion, vacation or modification of such action.
(c) Power of a single judge to entertain motions. In addition to the
authority expressly conferred by these rules or by law, a single judge
of a court of appeals may entertain and may grant or deny any request
for relief which under these rules may properly be sought by motion,
except that a single judge may not dismiss or otherwise determine an
appeal or other proceeding, and except that a court of appeals may
provide by order or rule that any motion or class of motions must be
acted upon by the court. The action of a single judge may be reviewed
by the court.
(d) Form of papers; number of copies. All papers relating to
motions may be typewritten. Three copies shall be filed with the origi-
nal, but the court may require that additional copies be furnished.

MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1967
165
Rule 28. Briefs
(a) Brief of the appellant. The brief of the appellant shall contain
under appropriate headings and in the order here indicated:
(1) A table of contents, with page references, and a table of
cases (alphabetically arranged), statutes and other authorities
cited, with reference to the pages of the brief where they are
cited.
(2) A statement of the issues presented for review.
(3) A statement of the case. The statement shall first indicate
briefly the nature of the case, the course of proceedings, and its
disposition in the court below. There shall follow a statement of
the facts relevent to the issues presented for review, with appro-
priate references to the record (see subdivision (e)).
(4) An argument. The argument may be preceded by a sum-
mary. The argument shall contain the contentions of the appellant
with respect to the issues presented, and the reasons therefor,
with citations to the authorities, statutes and parts of the record
relied on.
(5) A short conclusion stating the precise relief sought.
(b) Brief of the appellee. The brief of the appellee shall conform
to the requirements of subdivision (a) (1)–(4), except that a state-
ment of the issues or of the case need not be made unless the appellee
is dissatisfied with the statement of the appellant.
(c) Reply brief. The appellant may file a brief in reply to the brief
of the appellee, and if the appellee has cross-appealed, the appellee
may file a brief in reply to the response of the appellant to the issues
presented by the cross appeal. No further briefs may be filed except
with leave of court.
(d) References in briefs to parties. Counsel will be expected in their
briefs and oral arguments to keep to a minimum references to parties
by such designations as "appellant" and "appellee". It promotes clarity
to use the designations used in the lower court or in the agency pro-
ceedings, or the actual names of parties, or descriptive terms such as
"the employee," "the injured person," "the taxpayer," "the ship," "the
stevedore," etc.
(e) References in briefs to the record. References in the briefs to
parts of the record reproduced in the appendix filed with the brief of
the appellant (see Rule 30(a)) shall be to the pages of the appendix
at which those parts appear. If the appendix is prepared after the
briefs are filed, references in the briefs to the record shall be made by
one of the methods allowed by Rule 30 (c). If the record is reproduced
in accordance with the provisions of Rule 30 (f), or if references are
made in the briefs to parts of the record not reproduced, the references
shall be to the pages of the parts of the record involved; e.g., Answer
p. 7, Motion for Judgment p. 2, Transcript p. 231. Intelligible abbre-

MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1967
166
viations may be used. If reference is made to evidence the admissibility
of which is in controversy, reference shall be made to the pages of the
appendix or of the transcript at which the evidence was identified,
offered, and received or rejected.
(f) Reproduction of statutes, rules, regulations, etc. If determina-
tion of the issues presented requires the study of statutes, rules, regu-
lations, etc. or relevant parts thereof, they shall be reproduced in the
brief or in an addendum at the end, or they may be supplied to the
court in pamphlet form.
(g) Length of briefs. Except by permission of the court, principal
briefs shall not exceed 50 pages of standard typographic printing or
70 pages of printing by any other process of duplicating or copying,
'exclusive of pages containing the table of contents, tables of citations
and any addendum containing statutes, rules, regulations, etc. And
except by permission of the court, reply briefs shall not exceed 25
pages of standard typographic printing or 35 pages of printing by
any other process of duplicating or copying.
(h) Briefs in cases involving cross appeals. If a cross appeal is filed,
the plaintiff in the court below shall be deemed the appellant for the
purposes of this rule and Rules 30 and 31, unless the parties otherwise
agree or the court otherwise orders. The brief of the appellee shall con-
tain the issues and argument involved in his appeal as well as the
answer to the brief of the appellant.
(i) Briefs in cases involving multiple appellants or appellees. In
cases involving more than one appellant or appellee, including cases
'consolidated for purposes of the appeal, any number of either may join
in a single brief, and any appellant or appellee may adopt by reference
'any part of the brief of another. Parties may similarly join in reply
briefs.
Rule 29. Brief of an amicus curiae
A brief of an amicus curiae may be filed only if accompanied by
written consent of all parties, or by leave of court granted on motion
or at the request of the court, except that consent or leave shall not be
required when the brief is presented by the United States or an officer
or agency thereof, or by a State, Territory or Commonwealth. The
brief may be conditionally filed with the motion for leave. A motion
for leave shall identify the interest of the applicant and shall state
the reasons why a brief of an amicus curiae is desirable. Save as all
parties otherwise consent, any amicus curiae shall file its brief within
the time allowed the party whose position as to affirmance or reversal
the amicus brief will support unless the court for cause shown shall
grant leave for later filing, in which event it shall specify within
what period an opposing party may answer. A motion of an amicus
curiae to participate in the oral argument will be granted only for
extraordinary reasons.

MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1967
Rule 30. Appendix to the briefs
167
(a) Duty of appellant to prepare and file; content of appendix;
time for filing; number of copies. The appellant shall prepare and file
an appendix to the briefs which shall contain: (1) the relevant
docket entries in the proceeding below; (2) any relevant portions of
the pleadings, charge, findings or opinion; (3) the judgment, order or
decision in question; and (4) any other parts of the record to which
the parties wish to direct the particular attention of the court. The
fact that parts of the record are not included in the appendix shall
not prevent the parties or the court from relying on such parts.
Unless filing is to be deferred pursuant to the provisions of sub-
division (c) of this rule, the appellant shall serve and file the appen-
dix within 40 days of the date on which the record is filed. Ten copies
of the appendix shall be filed with the clerk, and one copy shall be
served on counsel for each party separately represented, unless the
court shall by rule or order direct the filing or service of a lesser
number.
(b) Determination of contents of appendix; cost of producing.
The parties are encouraged to agree as to the contents of the appen-
dix. In the absence of agreement, the appellant shall, not later than 10
days after the date on which the record is filed, serve on the appellee
a designation of the parts of the record which he intends to in-
clude in the appendix and a statement of the issues which he intends
to present for review. If the appellee deems it necessary to direct the
particular attention of the court to parts of the record not designated
by the appellant, he shall, within ten days after receipt of the desig-
nation, serve upon the appellant a designation of those parts. The
appellant shall include in the appendix the parts thus designated. In
designating parts of the record for inclusion in the appendix, the
parties shall have regard for the fact that the entire record is always
available to the court for reference and examination and shall not
engage in unnecessary designation.
Unless the parties otherwise agree, the cost of producing the ap-
pendix shall initially be paid by the appellant, but if the appellant
considers that parts of the record designated by the appellee for in-
clusion are unnecessary for the determination of the issues presented
he may so advise the appellee and the appellee shall advance the cost
of including such parts. The cost of producing the appendix shall
be taxed as costs in the case, but if either party shall cause matters
to be included in the appendix unnecessarily the court may impose
the cost of producing such parts on the party.
(c) Alternative method of designating contents of the appendix;
how references to the record may be made in the briefs when alterna-
tive method is used. If the appellant shall so elect, or if the court shall
so provide by rule for classes of cases or by order in specific cases,

MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1967
168
preparation of the appendix may be deferred until after the briefs
have been filed, and the appendix may be filed 21 days after service of
the brief of the appellee. Notice of the election by the appellant to defer
preparation of the appendix shall be filed and served by him within
10 days after the date on which the record is filed. If the preparation
and filing of the appendix is thus deferred, the provisions of sub-
division (b) of this Rule 30 shall apply, except that the designations
referred to therein shall be made by each party at the time his brief
is served, and a statement of the issued presented shall be unnecessary.
If the deferred appendix authorized by this subdivision is employed,
references in the briefs to the record may be to the pages of the parts
of the record involved, in which event the original paging of each part
of the record shall be indicated in the appendix by placing in brackets
the number of each page at the place in the appendix where that page
begins. Or if a party desires to refer in his brief directly to pages of
the appendix, he may serve and file typewritten or page proof copies
of his brief within the time required by Rule 31(a), with appropriate
references to the pages of the parts of the record involved. In that
event, within 14 days after the appendix is filed he shall serve and
file copies of the brief in the form prescribed by Rule 32 (a) containing
references to the pages of the appendix in place of or in addition to the
initial references to the pages of the parts of the record involved.
No other changes may be made in the brief as initially served and
filed, except that typographical errors may be corrected.
(d) Arrangement of the appendix. At the beginning of the ap-
pendix there shall be inserted a list of the parts of the record which
it contains, in the order in which the parts are set out therein, with
references to the pages of the appendix at which each part begins.
The relevant docket entries shall be set out following the list of con-
tents. Thereafter, other parts of the record shall be set out in chrono-
logical order. When matter contained in the reporter's transcript of
proceedings is set out in the appendix, the page of the transcript at
which such matter may be found shall be indicated in brackets immedi-
ately before the matter which is set out. Omissions in the text of papers
or of the transcript must be indicated by asterisks. Immaterial formal
matters (captions, subscriptions, acknowledgments, etc.) shall be
omitted. A question and its answer may be contained in a single
paragraph.
(e) Reproduction of exhibits. Exhibits designated for inclusion in
the appendix may be contained in a separate volume, or volumes, suit-
ably indexed. Four copies thereof shall be filed with the appendix and
one copy shall be served on counsel for each party separately repre-
sented. The transcript of a proceeding before an administrative agency,
board, commission or officer used in an action in the district court shall
be regarded as an exhibit for the purpose of this subdivision.

MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1967
169
(f) Hearing of appeals on the original record without the necessity
of an appendix. A court of appeals may by rule applicable to all cases,
or to classes of cases, or by order in specific cases, dispense with the
requirement of an appendix and permit appeals to be heard on the
original record, with such copies of the record, or relevant parts
thereof, as the court may require.
| Rule 31. Filing and service of briefs
(a) Time for serving and filing briefs. The appellant shall serve and
file his brief within 40 days after the date on which the record is
filed. The appellee shall serve and file his brief within 30 days after
service of the brief of the appellant. The appellant may serve and file
a reply brief within 14 days after service of the brief of the appellee,
but, except for good cause shown, a reply brief must be filed at least
3 days before argument.
(b) Number of copies to be filed and served. Twenty-five copies of
each brief shall be filed with the clerk, unless the court by order in a
particular case shall direct a lesser number, and two copies shall be
served on counsel for each party separately represented. If a party is
allowed to file typewritten ribbon and carbon copies of the brief, the
original and three legible copies shall be filed with the clerk, and one
copy shall be served on counsel for each party separately represented.
(c) Consequence of failure to file briefs. If an appellant fails to file
his brief within the time provided by this rule, or within the time as
extended, an appellee may move for dismissal of the appeal. If an
appellee fails to file his brief, he will not be heard at oral argument
except by permission of the court.
Rule 32. Form of briefs, the appendix and other papers
(a) Form of briefs and the appendix. Briefs and appendices may be
produced by standard typographic printing or by any duplicating or
copying process which produces a clear black image on white paper.
Carbon copies of briefs and appendices may not be submitted without
permission of the court, except in behalf of parties allowed to proceed
in forma pauperis. All printed matter must appear in at least 11 point
type on opaque, unglazed paper. Briefs and appendices produced by
the standard typographic process shall be bound in volumes having
pages 6 by 914 inches and type matter 4 by 7½ inches. Those pro-
duced by any other process shall be bound in volumes having pages
not exceeding 812 by 11 inches and type matter not exceeding 612 by
91/2 inches, with double spacing between each line of text. In patent
cases the pages of briefs and appendices may be of such size as is neces-
sary to utilize copies of patent documents. Copies of the reporter's
transcript and other papers reproduced in a manner authorized by

MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1967
170
this rule may be inserted in the appendix; such pages may be in-
formally renumbered if necessary.
If briefs are produced by commercial printing or duplicating firms,
or, if produced otherwise and the covers to be described are available,
the cover of the brief of the appellant should be blue; that of the
appellee, red; that of an intervenor or amicus curiae, green; that of
any reply brief, gray. The cover of the appendix, if separately printed,
should be white. The front covers of the briefs and of appendices, if
separately printed, shall contain: (1) the name of the court and the
number of the case; (2) the title of the case (see Rule 12(a)); (3) the
nature of the proceedings in the court (e.g., Appeal; Petition for Re-
view) and the name of the court, agency, or board below; (4) the title
of the document (e.g., Brief for Appellant, Appendix); and (5) the
names and addresses of counsel representing the party on whose behalf
the document is filed.
(b) Form of other papers. Petitions for rehearing shall be produced
in a manner prescribed by subdivision (a). Motions and other papers
may be produced in like manner, or they may be typewritten upon
opaque, unglazed paper 8½ by 11 inches in size. Lines of type-
written text shall be double spaced. Consecutive sheets shall be at-
tached at the left margin. Carbon copies may be used for filing and
service if they are legible.
A motion or other paper addressed to the court shall contain a cap-
tion setting forth the name of the court, the title of the case, the file
number, and a brief descriptive title indicating the purpose of the
paper.
Rule 33. Prehearing conference
The court may direct the attorneys for the parties to appear before
the court or a judge thereof for a prehearing conference to consider
the simplification of the issues and such other matters as may aid in
the disposition of the proceeding by the court. The court or judge
shall make an order which recites the action taken at the conference
and the agreements made by the parties as to any of the matters con-
sidered and which limits the issues to those not disposed of by ad-
missions or agreements of counsel, and such order when entered con-
trols the subsequent course of the proceeding, unless modified to pre-
vent manifest injustice.
Rule 34. Oral argument
(a) Notice of argument; postponement. The clerk shall advise all
parties of the time and place at which oral argument will be heard.
A request for postponement of the argument must be made by motion
filed reasonably in advance of the date fixed for hearing.
(b) Time allowed for argument. Unless otherwise provided by rule
for all cases or for classes of cases, each side will be allowed 30 minutes

MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1967
171
for argument. If counsel is of the opinion that additional time is
necessary for the adequate presentation of his argument, he may re-
quest such additional time as he deems necessary. Requests may be
made by letter addressed to the clerk reasonably in advance of the
date fixed for the argument and shall be liberally granted if cause
therefor is shown. A party is not obliged to use all of the time allowed,
and the court may terminate the argument whenever in its judgment
further argument is unnecessary.
(c) Order and content of argument. The appellant is entitled to
open and conclude the argument. The opening argument shall include
a fair statement of the case. Counsel will not be permitted to read at
length from briefs, records or authorities.
(d) Cross and separate appeals. A cross or separate appeal shall be
argued with the initial appeal at a single argument, unless the court
otherwise directs. If a case involves a cross-appeal, the plaintiff in the
action below shall be deemed the appellant for the purpose of this
rule unless the parties otherwise agree or the court otherwise directs.
If separate appellants support the same argument, care shall be taken
to avoid duplication of argument.
(e) Non-appearance of parties. If the appellee fails to appear to
present argument, the court will hear argument on behalf of the ap-
pellant, if present. If the appellant fails to appear, the court may
hear argument on behalf of the appellee, if his counsel is present. If
neither party appears, the case will be decided on the briefs unless the
court shall otherwise order.
(f) Submission on briefs. By agreement of the parties, a case may
be submitted for decision on the briefs, but the court may direct that
the case be argued.
(9) Use of physical exhibits at argument; removal. If physical
exhibits other than documents are to be used at the argument, counsel
shall arrange to have them placed in the court room before the court
convenes on the date of the argument. After the argument counsel
shall cause the exhibits to be removed from the court room unless the
court otherwise directs. If exhibits are not reclaimed by counsel within
a reasonable time after notice is given by the clerk, they shall be de-
stroyed or otherwise disposed of as the clerk shall think best.
Rule 35. Determination of causes by the court in banc
(a) When hearing or rehearing in banc will be ordered. A majority
of the circuit judges who are in regular active service may order that
an appeal or other proceeding be heard or reheard by the court of
appeals in banc. Such a hearing or rehearing is not favored and ordi-
narily will not be ordered except (1) when consideration by the full
court is necessary to secure or maintain uniformity of its decisions, or
(2) when the proceeding involves a question of exceptional
importance.

MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1967
172
(b) Suggestion of a party for hearing or rehearing in banc. A
party may suggest the appropriateness of a hearing or rehearing in
banc. The clerk shall transmit any such suggestion to the judges of
the court who are in regular active service but a vote will not be
taken to determine whether the cause shall be heard or reheard in
banc unless a judge in regular active service or a judge who was a
member of the panel that rendered a decision sought to be heard re-
quests a vote on such a suggestion made by a party.
(c) Time for suggestion of a party for rehearing in banc; sugges-
tion does not stay mandate. If a party desires to suggest a rehear-
ing in banc, the suggestion must be made within the time pre-
scribed by Rule 40 for filing a petition for rehearing, whether the sug-
gestion is made in such petition or otherwise. The pendency of such
a suggestion whether or not included in a petition for rehearing
shall not affect the finality of the judgment of the court of appeals or
stay the issuance of the mandate.
Rule 36. Entry of judgment
The notation of a judgment in the docket constitutes entry of the
judgment. The clerk shall prepare, sign and enter the judgment
following receipt of the opinion of the court unless the opinion directs
settlement of the form of the judgment, in which event the clerk
shall prepare, sign and enter the judgment following final settle-
ment by the court. If a judgment is rendered without an opinion, the
clerk shall prepare, sign and enter the judgment following instruc-
tion from the court. The clerk shall, on the date judgment is entered,
mail to all parties a copy of the opinion, if any, or of the judgment if
no opinion was written, and notice of the date of entry of the judg-
ment.
Rule 37. Interest on judgments
Unless otherwise provided by law, if a judgment for money in a
civil case is affirmed, whatever interest is allowed by law shall be pay-
able from the date the judgment was entered in the district court. If
a judgment is modified or reversed with a direction that a judgment
for
money be entered in the district court, the mandate shall contain
instructions with respect to allowance of interest.
Rule 38. Damages for delay
If a court of appeals shall determine that an appeal is frivolous, it
may award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee.
Rule 39. Costs
(a) To whom allowed. Except as otherwise provided by law, if an
appeal is dismissed, costs shall be taxed against the appellant unless
otherwise agreed by the parties or ordered by the court; if a judgment
is affirmed, costs shall be taxed against the appellant unless otherwise

MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1967
173
ordered; if a judgment is reversed, costs shall be taxed against the
appellee unless otherwise ordered; if a judgment is affirmed or re-
versed in part, or is vacated, costs shall be allowed only as ordered by
the court.
(b) Costs for and against the United States. In cases involving
the United States or an agency or officer thereof, if an award of
costs against the United States is authorized by law, costs shall be
awarded in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (a); other-
wise, costs shall not be awarded for or against the United States.
(c) Costs of briefs, appendices, and copies of records. The cost of
printing or otherwise producing necessary copies of briefs, appendices,
or copies of records authorized by Rule 30 (f) shall be taxable in the
court of appeals at rates not higher than those generally charged
for such work in the area where the clerk's office is located. A party
who desires such costs to be taxed shall state them in an itemized and
verified bill of costs which he shall file with the clerk, with proof of
service, within 14 days after the entry of judgment.
(d) Clerk to insert costs in mandate. The clerk shall prepare and
certify an itemized statement of costs taxed in the court of appeals
for insertion in the mandate. If the mandate has been issued before
final determination of costs, the statement, or any amendment
thereof, may be added to the mandate at any time upon request of the
clerk of the court of appeals.
(e) Costs on appeal taxable in the district courts. Costs incurred
in the preparation and transmission of the record, the cost of the
reporter's transcript, if necessary for the determination of the appeal,
the premiums paid for cost of supersedeas bonds or other bonds to
preserve rights pending appeal, and the fee for filing the notice of
appeal shall be taxed in the district court as costs of the appeal in
favor of the party entitled to costs under this rule.
Rule 40. Petition for rehearing
(a) Time for filing; content; answer; action by court if granted.
A petition for rehearing may be filed within 14 days after entry of
judgment unless the time is shortened or enlarged by order. The peti-
tion shall state with particularity the points of law or fact which in
the opinion of the petitioner the court has overlooked or misappre-
hended and shall contain such argument in support of the petition
as the petitioner desires to present. Oral argument in support of the
petition will not be permitted. No answer to a petition for rehearing
will be received unless requested by the court, but a petition for re-
hearing will ordinarily not be granted in the absence of such a re-
quest. If a petition for rehearing is granted the court may make a
final disposition of the cause without reargument or may restore it
to the calendar for reargument or resubmission or may make such

MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1967
174
other orders as are deemed appropriate under the circumstances of
the particular case.
(b) Form of petition; lenth. The petition shall be in a form pre-
scribed by Rule 32(a), and copies shall be served and filed as pre-
scribed by Rule 31(c) for the service and filing of briefs. Except by
permission of the court, a petition for rehearing shall not exceed 10
pages of standard typographic printing or 15 pages of printing by
any other process of duplicating or copying.
Rule 41. Issuance of mandate; stay of mandate
(a) Date of issuance. The mandate of the court shall issue 21 days
after the entry of judgment unless the time is shortened or enlarged
by order. A certified copy of the judgment and a copy of the opinion
of the court, if any, and any direction as to costs shall constitute the
mandate, unless the court directs that a formal mandate issue. The
timely filing of a petition for rehearing will stay the mandate until
disposition of the petition unless otherwise ordered by the court. If
the petition is denied, the mandate shall issue 7 days after entry of the
order denying the petition unless the time is shortened or enlarged
by order.
(b) Stay of mandate pending application for certiorari. A stay of
the mandate pending application to the Supreme Court for a writ of
certiorari may be granted upon motion, reasonable notice of which shall
be given to all parties. The stay shall not exceed 30 days unless the pe-
riod is extended for cause shown. If during the period of the stay there
is filed with the clerk of the court of appeals a notice from the clerk
of the Supreme Court that the party who has obtained the stay has
filed a petition for the writ in that court, the stay shall continue until
final disposition by the Supreme Court. Upon the filing of a copy of
an order of the Supreme Court denying the petition for writ of cer-
tiorari the mandate shall issue immediately. A bond or other security
may be required as a condition to the grant or continuance of a stay
of the mandate.
Rule 42. Voluntary dismissal
(a) Dismissal in the district court. If an appeal has not been dock-
eted, the appeal may be dismissed by the district court upon
the filing
in that court of a stipulation for dismissal signed by all the parties, or
upon motion and notice by the appellant.
(b) Dismissal in the court of appeals. If the parties to an appeal
or other proceeding shall sign and file with the clerk of the court of
appeals an agreement that the proceeding be dismissed, specifying
the terms as to payment of costs, and shall pay whatever fees are due,
the clerk shall enter the case dismissed, but no mandate or other
process shall issue without an order of the court. An appeal may be
dismissed on motion of the appellant upon such terms as may be
agreed upon by the parties or fixed by the court.

MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1967
Rule 43. Substitution of parties
175
(a) Death of a party. If a party dies after a notice of appeal is
filed or while a proceeding is otherwise pending in the court of appeals,
the personal representative of the deceased party may be substituted
as a party on motion filed by the representative or by any party with
the clerk of the court of appeals. The motion of a party shall be served
upon the representative in accordance with the provisions of Rule 25.
If the deceased party has no representative, any party may suggest
the death on the record and proceedings shall then be had as the court
of appeals may direct. If a party against whom an appeal may be
taken dies after entry of a judgment or order in the district court but
before a notice of appeal is filed, an appellant may proceed as if death
had not occurred. After the notice of appeal is filed substitution shall
be effected in the court of appeals in accordance with this subdivision.
If a party entitled to appeal shall die before filing a notice of appeal,
the notice of appeal may be filed by his personal representative, or,
if he has no personal representative, by his attorney of record within
the time prescribed by these rules. After the notice of appeal is filed
substitution shall be effected in the court of appeals in accordance with
this subdivision.
(b) Substitution for other causes. If substitution of a party in the
court of appeals is necessary for any reason other than death, sub-
stitution shall be effected in accordance with the procedure prescribed
in subdivision (a).
(c) Public Officers; death or separation from office.
(1) When a public officer is a party to an appeal or other proceed-
ing in the court of appeals in his official capacity and during its pend-
ency dies, resigns or otherwise ceases to hold office, the action does
not abate and his successor is automatically substituted as a party.
Proceedings following the substitution shall be in the name of the
substituted party, but any misnomer not affecting the substantial
rights of the parties shall be disregarded. An order of substitution
may be entered at any time, but the omission to enter such an order
shall not affect the substitution.
(2) When a public officer is a party to an appeal or other proceeding
in his official capacity he may be described as a party by his official
title rather than by name; but the court may require his name to be
added.
Rule 44. Cases involving constitutional questions where United States
is not a party
It shall be the duty of a party who draws in question the constitu-
tionality of any Act of Congress in any proceeding in a court of appeals
to which the United States, or any agency thereof, or any officer or em-
ployee thereof, as such officer or employee, is not a party upon the
filing of the record, or as soon thereafter as the question is raised in

MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1967
176
the court of appeals, to give immediate notice in writing to the court
of the existence of said question. The clerk shall thereupon certify such
fact to the Attorney General.
Rule 45. Duties of clerks
(a) General provisions. The clerk of a court of appeals shall take
the oath and give the bond required by law. Neither the clerk nor any
deputy clerk shall practice as an attorney or as counselor in any court
while he continues in office. The court of appeals shall be deemed
always open for the purpose of filing any proper paper, of issuing
and returning process and of making motions and orders. The office of
the clerk with the clerk or a deputy in attendance shall be open during
business hours on all days except Saturdays, Sundays and legal holi-
days, but a court may provide by local rule or order that the office of
its clerk shall be open for specified hours on Saturdays or on particular
legal holidays other than New Year's Day, Washington's Birthday.
Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Veterans Day, Thanks-
giving Day and Christmas Day.
(b) The docket; calendar; other records required. The clerk shall
keep a book known as the docket, in such form and style as may be pre-
scribed by the Director of the Administrative Office of the United
States Courts with the approval of the Judicial Conference of the
United States, and shall enter therein each case. Cases shall be as-
signed consecutive file numbers. The file number of each case shall be
noted on the folio of the docket whereon the first entry is made. All
papers filed with the clerk and all process, orders and judgments shall
be entered chronologically in the docket on the folio assigned to the
case. Entries shall be brief but shall show the nature of each paper
filed or judgment or order entered. The entry of an order or judgment
shall show the date the entry is made. The clerk shall keep a suitable
index of cases contained in the docket.
The clerk shall prepare, under the direction of the court, a calendar
of cases awaiting argument. In placing cases on the calendar for argu-
ment, he shall give preference to appeals in criminal cases and to
appeals and other proceedings entitled to preference by law.
The clerk shall keep such other books and records as may be required
from time to time by the Director of the Administrative Office of the
United States Courts with the approval of the Judicial Conference of
the United States, or as may be required by the court.
(c) Notice of orders or judgments. Immediately upon the entry of
an order or judgment the clerk shall serve a notice of entry by mail
upon each party to the proceeding together with a copy of any opinion
respecting the order or judgment, and shall make a note in the docket
of the mailing. Service on a party represented by counsel shall be made
on counsel.

MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1967
177
(d) Custody of records and papers. The clerk shall have custody of
the records and papers of the court. He shall not permit any original
record or paper to be taken from his custody except as authorized by
the orders or instructions of the court. Original papers transmitted as
the record on appeal or review shall upon disposition of the case be
returned to the court or agency from which they were received. The
clerk shall preserve copies of briefs and appendices and other printed
papers filed.
Rule 46. Attorneys
(a) Admission to the bar of a court of appeals; eligibility; pro-
cedure for admission. An attorney who has been admitted to practice
before the Supreme Court of the United States, or the highest court
of a state, or another United States court of appeals, or a United
States district court (including the district courts for the Canal Zone,
Guam, and the Virgin Islands), and who is of good moral and profes-
sional character, is eligible for admission to the bar of a court of
appeals.
An applicant shall file with the clerk of the court of appeals, on
a form approved by the court and furnished by the clerk, an applica-
tion for admission containing his personal statement showing his
eligibility for membership. At the foot of the application the applicant
shall take and subscribe to the following oath or affirmation:
---
-
I₁
do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I
will demean myself as an attorney and counselor of this court,
uprightly and according to law; and that I will support the
Constitution of the United States.
Thereafter, upon written or oral motion of a member of the bar of
the court, the court will act upon the application. An applicant may be
admitted by oral motion in open court, but it is not necessary that
he appear before the court for the purpose of being admitted, unless
the court shall otherwise order. An applicant shall upon admission
pay the clerk the fee prescribed by rule or order of the court.
(b) Suspension or disbarment. When it is shown to the court that
any member of its bar has been suspended or disbarred from prac-
tice in any other court of record, or has been guilty of conduct unbe-
coming a member of the bar of the court, he will be subject to suspen-
sion or disbarment by the court. The member shall be afforded an
opportunity to show good cause, within such time as the court shall
prescribe, why he should not be suspended or disbarred. Upon his
response to the rule to show cause, and after hearing, if requested,
or upon expiration of the time prescribed for a response if no response
is made, the court shall enter an appropriate order.
(c) Disciplinary power of the court over attorneys. A court of
appeals may, after reasonable notice and an opportunity to show cause

MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1967
178
to the contrary, and after hearing, if requested, take any appropriate
disciplinary action against any attorney who practices before it for
conduct unbecoming a member of the bar or for failure to comply
with these rules or any rule of the court.
Rule 47. Rules by courts of appeals
Each court of appeals by action of a majority of the circuit judges
in regular active service may from time to time make and amend
rules governing its practice not inconsistent with these rules. In all
cases not provided for by rule, the courts of appeals may regulate
their practice in any manner not inconsistent with these rules. Copies
of all rules made by a court of appeals shall upon their promulga-
tion be furnished to the Administrative Office of the United States
Courts.
Rule 48. Title
These rules may be known and cited as the Federal Rules of Ap-
pellate Procedure.

District Judge.
2. That the foregoing rules shall take effect on July 1, 1968, and
shall govern all proceedings in appeals and petitions for review or
enforcement of orders thereafter brought and in all such proceedings
then pending, except to the extent that in the opinion of the court of
appeals their application in a particular proceeding then pending

MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1967
181
would not be feasible or would work injustice, in which case the former
procedure may be followed.
3. That Rules 6, 9, 41, 77 and 81 of the Rules of Civil Procedure for
the United States District Courts be, and they hereby are, amended,
effective July 1, 1968, as hereinafter set forth:
Rule 6. Time
(b) Enlargement. When by these rules or by a notice given there-
under or by order of court an act is required or allowed to be done at
or within a specified time, the court for cause shown may at any time
in its discretion (1) with or without motion or notice order the period
enlarged if request therefor is made before the expiration of the period
originally prescribed or as extended by a previous order, or (2) upon
motion made after the expiration of the specified period permit the act
to be done where the failure to act was the result of excusable neglect;
but it may not extend the time for taking any action under Rules
50(b), 52(b), 59(b), (d) and (e), and 60 (b), except to the extent and
under the conditions stated in them.
Rule 9. Pleading special matters
(h) ADMIRALITY AND MARitime claimS. A pleading or
count setting forth a claim for relief within the admirality and mari-
time jurisdiction that is also within the jurisdiction of the district
court on some other ground may contain a statement identifying the
claim as an admirality or maritime claim for the purposes of Rule
14(c), 26(a), 38(e), 82 and the Supplemental Rules for Certain
Admirality and Maritime Claims. If the claim is cognizable only in
admirality it is an admirality or maritime claim for those purposes
whether so identified or not. The amendment of a pleading to add
or withdraw an identifying statement is governed by the principles
of Rule 15. The reference in Title 28, U.S.C. § 1292 (a) (3), to admir-
ality cases shall be construed to mean admirality and maritime claims
within the meaning of this subdivision (h).
Rule 41. Dismissal of actions
(a) Voluntary dismissal: effect thereof.
(1) By plaintiff; by stipulation. Subject to the provisions of Rule
23(e), of Rule 66, and of any statute of the United States, an action
may be dismissed by the plaintiff without order of court (i) by filing
a notice of dismissal at any time before service by the adverse party
of an answer or of a motion for summary judgment, whichever first
occurs, or (ii) by filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all parties
who have appeared in the action. Unless otherwise stated in the notice
of dismissal or stipulation, the dismissal is without prejudice, except
that a notice of dismissal operates as an adjudication upon the merits
when filed by a plaintiff who has once dismissed in any court of the

MONDAY, DECEMBER 4, 1967
182
United States or of any state an action based on or including the
same claim.
Rule . District courts and clerks
(d) Notice of orders or judgments. Immediately upon the entry of
an order or judgment the clerk shall serve a notice of the entry by mail
in the manner provided for in Rule 5 upon each party who is not in
default for failure to appear, and shall make a note in the docket of
the mailing. Such mailing is sufficient notice for all purposes for
which notice of the entry of an order is required by these rules; but
any party may in addition serve a notice of such entry in the manner
provided in Rule 5 for the service of papers. Lack of notice of the
entry by the clerk does not affect the time to appeal or relieve or
authorize the court to relieve a party for failure to appeal within the

do not apply to mental health proceedings in the United States Dis-
trict Court for the District of Columbia.
(2) These rules are applicable to proceedings for admission to
citizenship, habeas corpus, and quo warranto, to the extent that the

enlarged if request therefor is made before the expiration of the period
originally prescribed or as extended by a previous order or (2) upon
motion made after the expiration of the specified period permit the

Rules 29, 33, 34 and 35, except to the extent and under the conditions
stated in them.
Rule 49. Service and filing of papers
(c) Notice of orders. Immediately upon the entry of an order made
on a written motion subsequent to arraignment the clerk shall mail

for failure to appeal within the time allowed, except as permitted by
Rule 4(b) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.

order of December 4, 1967, denying the petition for a writ of certiorari
to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit is vacated and the following order is entered:
"PER CURIAM.
"This case is a consequence of a dispute with respect to the scope of
an arbitration award governing the manning of trains and engines in
freight service. The union took the position that the award had no
effect after 12:01 a.m., March 31, 1966. On March 28, the District Court
for the District of Columbia issued a temporary restraining order
forbidding a strike. On March 31 the union struck against a number
of railroads. The District Court entered contempt orders, imposing
substantial fines for alleged violation of its restraining order. The
Court of Appeals ruled on various legal issues presented to it but
remanded to the District Court to consider whether there had in fact
been a contempt, and also, if there was a contempt, whether it was
'of such magnitude as to warrant retention, in part or to any extent,
of the coercive fine originally provided for in contemplation of an
outright refusal to obey.'

No. 548. Snohomish County, petitioner, v. Seattle Disposal Com-

whom Mr. Justice White concurs:
The Supreme Court of Washington held in a 6-3 decision that
the State lacks power to apply a local zoning ordinance for control of

MONDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1967
209
garbage dumps and sewage landfills to respondent, Disposal Com-
pany, a non-Indian lessee of two parcels of lands within the Tulalip
Tribes Reservation.
One section of the Act relevant to our problem-now codified as 28
U.S.C. § 1360-gave civil jurisdiction over Indians and Indian lands
to California, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oregon, and Wisconsin ¹ with
the following proviso:
"
Nothing in this section shall authorize the alienation, encum-
brance, or taxation of any real or personal property ... be-
longing to any Indian or any Indian tribe . . . that is held in
trust by the United States or is subject to a restriction against
alienation imposed by the United States; or shall authorize
regulation of the use of such property in a manner inconsistent
with any Federal treaty, agreement, or statute.
The federal question arises in the following manner. By Public Law
280, c. 505, § 7, 67 Stat. 590, Congress gave consent "to any other State
not having jurisdiction with respect to criminal and civil offenses or
civil causes of action [involving Indians and Indian lands], or with
respect to both, as provided for in this Act, ² to assume jurisdiction ..
by affirmative legislative action. . . ." (Italics added.)
Pursuant to Public Law 280, the State of Washington undertook to
assume jurisdiction over Indians and their lands upon their consent.
In the state enactment, jurisdiction was limited by Wash. Rev. Code
§ 37.12.060, which incorporated verbatim the restrictions quoted above
that are found in 28 U.S.C. § 1360.
In the case before us the Washington Supreme Court held that the
Tulalip Tribes' lands in issue were either held in trust or subject to
a restraint against alienation imposed by 25 U.S.C. §§ 403a and 403a-2,
which limit the length of leases made by the Tulalip Tribes and require
approval of the Secretary of the Interior of leasing practices. 3 The
majority then held that under both 28 U.S.C. § 1360 and the state
statute incorporating language from § 1360, zoning regulations were
"encumbrances" on Indian lands because they limit the use thereof.
One Washington state court decision, our decision in Squire v. Capoe-
man, 351 U.S. 1, and opinions of the Department of Interior were
relied on by the majority in formulating this definition of "encum-
brance."
1 These five States-and Alaska by later amendment-are the only States specifically
given jurisdiction without the need for state legislation. Washington obtained juris-
diction by way of the "any other State" clause in § 7 of the Act, quoted in part in text
below, which was not codified.
2 The italicized language is a reference to the proviso in § 1360, quoted in this
memorandum.
3 One of the arguments petitioner makes is that that parcel of Indian land not held in
trust by the Government was not, as held below, subject to restraint against alienation.
I have found little merit in this contention, since the Tulalip Tribes purchased the parcel
in question after 1956, with the effect that 25 U.S.C. § 403a-2 is controlling and restricts
the power to make leases.

MONDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1967
210
The majority also held that since 25 U.S.C. §§ 403a, 403b, and 415
authorized the Tulalip Tribes to make leases, their non-Indian lessees
were entitled to the benefit of the restriction on state jurisdiction.
Otherwise, reasoned the maojrity, the State would be interfering with
the Indians' right to make leases, and the State could not accomplish
indirectly-by subjecting respondent Disposal Company to zoning
regulations what it was prohibited to do by acting directly on the
Indians. For this proposition one South Dakota decision and our
decision in United States v. Allegheny County, 322 U.S. 174, were
relied on.
The dissent was of the view that a zoning regulation directed at
protecting public health and welfare was not an “encumbrance" as
that term is used in § 1360 and the state equivalent. In that view,
Indian activities which directly injure the citizenry of the State
at large, or reasonably appear to do so, should be subjected to state
control. Otherwise, state programs to check stagnation of water sup-
ply and pollution of the air would be frustrated. The dissent thought
that the term "encumbrance" in § 1360 should be construed in con-
junction with 25 U.S.C. § 231, which provides, inter alia, that the
Secretary of Interior permit state agents to enter on Indian lands to
enforce sanitation and quarantine regulations. Finally, said the dis-
sent, the non-Indian lessee could not rely on any immunity from
state regulations which the Indians themselves might enjoy. Okla-
homa Tax Comm'n v. Texas Co., 336 U. S. 342, where a non-Indian
lessee of mineral rights on Indian lands was held not immune from
state taxation of gross production, was cited.
A substantial federal question is presented. It is apparent from a
reading of the opinion of the Washington Supreme Court that the
State has assumed jurisdiction over Indians as extensive as permitted
by Public Law 280. There is nothing to suggest that when the State
copied the limitation on state jurisdiction found in § 1360 into the state
statute, the State intended to impose greater restrictions than § 1360
imposes. The questions presented, then, are whether zoning controls
over burning or dumping of garbage constitute an "encumbrance" on
Indian lands under § 1360 and whether a non-Indian lessee can enjoy
any immunity from state zoning that the Indians enjoy.
Subjecting respondent lessee to state regulations on garbage and
sewage disposal seems no more a burden or encumbrance on the
Indians' right to lease their lands than the state tax on oil production
of the non-Indian lessee in Oklahoma Tax Comm'n was a burden or
encumbrance on the rights of the Indians there involved to make
oil leases. In Oklahoma Tax Comm'n we said: "These cases present
no question concerning the immunity of the Indian lands themselves
from state taxation. There is no possibility that ultimate liability for
the taxes may fall upon the owner of the land.” 336 U.S., at 353. The

MONDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1967
211
same proposition, in a different context, may be true here, since all
petitioner demands is that respondent obtain a refuse disposal use
permit before commencing operations.
There may also be merit to the dissent's view that the immunity
of Indian lands to a state "encumbrance" cannot frustrate state pro-
grams to check air and water pollution. The States should, perhaps,
be able to prevent sewage dumped on Indians' lands from draining
into streams which flow into water supplies outside Indian lands. The
same is true of smoke from garbage burned on Indian lands that con-
tributes to smog over nearby cities. State controls in this area may
be permissible by virtue of 25 U.S.C. § 231, whether or not they are
achieved under the label "zoning" rather than "sanitation regulations."
The Solicitor General, in a memorandum expressing the views of
the United States, asserts that the decision below was correct because
it accorded with an administrative regulation of the Department of
Interior. This regulation * provides that no local zoning ordinance
shall be applicable to land leased from an Indian tribe where, as here,
the land is held in trust by or is subjected to a restriction against
alienation by the United States. The Supreme Court of Washington
did not rely on this regulation, and whether it is valid or unduly
restricts the state authority conferred by Public Law 280 and 25 U.S.C.
§ 231 is an important federal question this Court should decide. I
would grant certiorari.

No. 721. Ronald J. Dugas, petitioner, v. Nippon Yusen Kaisha.
Motion of American Trial Lawyers Association for leave to file a
* 25 CFR § 1.4 provides:
"(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, none of the laws, ordinances,
codes, resolutions, rules or other regulations of any State or political subdivision thereof
limiting, zoning, or otherwise governing, regulating, or controlling the use of develop-
ment of any real or personal property, including water rights, shall be applicable to any
such property leased from or held or used under agreement with and belonging to any
Indian or Indian tribe, band, or community that is held in trust by the United States
or is subject to a restriction against alienation imposed by the United States.
"(b) The Secretary of the Interior or his authorized representative may in specific
cases or in specific geographic areas adopt or make applicable to Indian lands all or any
part of such laws, ordinances, codes, resolutions, rules or other regulations referred to in
paragraph (a) of this section as he shall determine to be in the best interest of the Indian
owner or owners in achieving the highest and best use of such property. . . .”
5 The court below did rely on a 1942 decision of the Department of the Interior, 58 I. D.
52, holding that a Minnesota county could not apply a nonresidential zoning ordinance to
certain Indian lands. But this decision was rendered before Public Law 280 was enacted.

tioner Alderisio's place of business be subjected to in camera
inspection by the trial judge to determine the necessity of compel-
ling the Government to make disclosure of such records to peti-
tioners, and if so to what extent?
(2) If in camera inspection is authorized or ordered, by what
standards (for example, relevance and considerations of injury to
persons or to reputations) should the trial judge determine
whether the records are to be turned over to petitioners?
(3) What standards are to be applied in determining whether
each petitioner has standing to object to the use against him of the
information obtained from the electronic surveillance of peti-
tioner Alderisio's place of business? More specifically, does pe-
titioner Alderisio have standing to object to the use of any or all
information obtained from such electronic surveillance whether
or not he was present on the premises or party to a particular over-
heard conversation? Also, does petitioner Alderman have stand-
ing to object to the use against him of any or all information ob-
