  “Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. I have the honor to
present to the Court the Acting Solicitor General, Seth P. Waxman of
the District of Columbia.”
  The Chief Justice said:
   “Mr. Acting Solicitor General, the Court welcomes you to the per-
formance of the important office that you have assumed, to represent
the government of the United States before this Court. We wish you
well in your office.
   “As we open this morning, I note with sadness that our friend and
colleague, William Joseph Brennan, Jr., a retired Justice of this Court,
died on July 24, 1997, at Arlington, Virginia.
   “Born in Newark, New Jersey, on April 25, 1906, William Brennan
was the second of eight children born to Irish parents who emigrated
to the United States in 1890. An outstanding student from an early
age, he was an honor student of the Wharton School of the University
of Pennsylvania and graduated high in his class at Harvard Law School.
   “Justice Brennan joined a prominent New Jersey law firm where he
specialized in labor law. He was an Army officer during World War II
and served on the staff of the Undersecretary of War. Following a brief
return to private practice after the war, he began his judicial career.
He moved rapidly from the state trial bench to the New Jersey Su-
preme Court. President Eisenhower nominated him to this Court in
1956.
   “Justice Brennan authored many landmark opinions while on the
bench of this Court. He became a champion of an expansive view of
constitutional protection of individual rights. Following his retirement
in 1990 after 33 years on this bench, Justice Brennan often frequented

the building and continued a warm relationship with his former
colleagues.
   “The members of this Court will greatly miss Justice Brennan’s wit
and his friendly, buoyant spirit, and I speak for them in expressing our
profound sympathy to Mrs. Brennan, to his daughter and two sons, and
to all those whose lives were touched by this remarkable man. The
recess the Court takes this month will be in his memory. At an appro-
priate time, the traditional memorial observance of the Court and the
Bar of this Court will be held in this Courtroom.
   “Today’s orders of the Court have been certified by The Chief Jus-
tice, filed with the Clerk, and will not be announced orally.”

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

   Present: Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice Stevens, Justice O’Connor,
Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, Justice Souter, Justice Thomas, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer.
   The Chief Justice said:
   “The Court is in special session this afternoon to receive the Resolu-
tions of the Bar of the Supreme Court in tribute to our former col-
league and friend, Justice William J. Brennan.
   “The Court recognizes the Solicitor General.
   Mr. Solicitor General Waxman addressed the Court as follows:
   “Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: At a meeting today
of the Bar of this Court, Resolutions memorializing our deep respect
and affection for Justice Brennan were unanimously adopted. With the
Court’s leave, I shall summarize the Resolutions and ask that they be
set forth in their entirety in the records of the Court.

                           “RESOLUTION”
   “William Joseph Brennan, Jr., graced this Court for 34 extraordinary
years. Appointed in 1956 by President Eisenhower, his service spanned
eight presidencies, seventeen Congresses, and 146 volumes of the
United States Reports. His unique qualities of mind and heart touched
the lives of one-fifth of all Justices that have served on this Court, 112
law clerks, each of whom became part of the Justice’s extended family,
the full complement of the Court’s support personnel, all of whom he
regarded and treated as valued friends, and countless members of the
Bar.
   “His life was the embodiment of the American dream, and his judicial
career was a sustained effort to allow others to share in that dream.
Born in 1906 to Irish immigrant parents, he was enormously influenced
by his father, a coal worker, labor union and reform politician who
intended his son for the bar, and by the circumstances of his
upbringing.
   “What got me interested in people’s rights and liberties, the Justice
would later recall, was the kind of neighborhood I was brought up in.
I saw all kinds of suffering. People had to struggle.
   “Justice Brennan married Marjorie Leonard just before he gradua-
ted from the University of Pennsylvania with honors in economics. The
Justice was deeply devoted to Marjorie for 54 years, and their three

children, Bill, III, Hugh, and Nancy, were a constant source of joy and
comfort to them both.
   “At Harvard Law School, Bill Brennan’s performance earned him
acceptance by the Legal Aid Society, where he experienced firsthand
the power of the law to affect the lives of the weak.
   “Because his father had died during his second year at Harvard,
after graduation it fell to the Justice to support his mother, his wife,
and six siblings. He joined the most prestigious law firm in Newark,
its first Catholic lawyer, and later its first Catholic partner.
   “In 1942, at the age of 36, Justice Brennan volunteered for the Army.
Assigned to Los Angeles, he oversaw the massive influx of women into
civilian defense jobs. Despite housing shortages, he refused to take the
easy route of commandeering the homes of interned Japanese-
Americans. Awarded the Legion of Merit, he left the Army at the rank
of full colonel.
   “After the war, the Justice rose rapidly in the private bar. He devel-
oped a reputation as impeccably fair and gracious, both at the bar and
in the public arena. Though his livelihood depended on management-
side labor work, he spoke out in support of the right to strike, and in
favor of legislation to prohibit employer intimidation of union mem-
bers, but he also urged labor to accept its responsibilities not to invade
or trample upon the rights of other groups, and he vigorously con-
demned racial discrimination by unions.
   “In 1949, Justice Brennan began his judicial career on the New Jer-
sey trial bench. Soon thereafter, he was appointed to the Appellate
Division, and then elevated to the State supreme court. The Resolution
discusses his important work on that court.
   “During his extraordinary life, Justice Brennan’s legendary energy
level waned only once, when Marjorie lost a sustained battle with can-
cer in 1982. The Justice himself had conquered throat cancer, which
almost cost him his voice, but it was Marjorie’s death that sent his
morale plummeting.
   “His zest for life returned in 1983, when he married Mary Fowler,
his secretary of 26 years. Mary brought the Justice a new spring in
his step and renewed energy. The two shared a special love and a lot
of history.
   “One key to the power of the Brennan judicial legacy is the harmony
between the Justice’s life and his work. The personal traits we most
remember were his love of people and his ability to put himself in
others’ shoes. Virtually everyone who encountered Justice Brennan has
a story of his kindness, and he acknowledged his antagonists as he

embraced his adherents, as fellow human beings worthy of love, tolera-
tion, and respect.
   “Justice Brennan understood the wonder of a democratic society that
could lift the son of a penniless immigrant to the highest Court in the
land and not seem to notice that anything extraordinary had occurred.
   “Because he believed that the essence of American democracy is its
commitment to respect the equal, innate dignity of every human being,
Justice Brennan dedicated his judicial career to building a legal system
that reinforces true democracy by preserving its indispensable building
blocks, individuals living in freedom, mutual toleration, and respect.
   “The sweep and power of Justice Brennan’s contribution to American
law challenges our collective imaginations. He authored 533 opinions
for the Court, 694 dissents, and 346 concurrences.
   “Our ideal of democracy flows from his historic opinion for the Court
in Baker v. Carr.
   “Our modern conception of free speech was articulated in his opin-
ions for the Court in New York Times v. Sullivan, Texas v. Johnson,
and Brandenburg v. Ohio.
   “Our understanding of freedom of association was shaped by
NAACP v. Button, Elrod v. Burns, and Roberts v. United States
Jaycees.
   “Our commitment to academic freedom was defined in Keyishian.
The doctrine of unconstitutional conditions flows from Justice Bren-
nan’s opinions in Speiser v. Randall, and League of Women Voters.
   “Contemporary protection for the free exercise of religion begins
with his opinion for the Court in Sherbert v. Verner.
   “Our modern understanding of the Establishment Clause, initially
propounded in his separate opinion in Abington School District v.
Schempp, was classically restated in Justice Brennan’s opinion for the
Court in Edwards v. Aguillard.
   “Our commitment to equality before the law was deepened and ad-
vanced by opinions he prepared in Cooper v. Aaron, Green v. County
School Board, Keyes, Frontiero, and Craig v. Boren.
   “Our contemporary understanding of procedural fairness was shaped
by Jencks, Bruton, Winship, and Goldberg v. Kelly.
   “Our approach to collective bargaining and the rights of the individ-
ual employee in that process was influenced by Communications
Workers v. Beck, and Boys Markets.
   “Our modern understanding of the preeminent role of Federal courts
as guarantors of individual liberty is based on Justice Brennan’s opin-
ions for the Court in cases like Monell, Bivens, and Cooper.

   “The Resolution discusses Justice Brennan’s contributions in each of
these areas.
   “When he wrote in dissent, Justice Brennan spoke to the future. His
sustained and passionate efforts with respect to capital punishment,
his concern for nontextual rights inherent in human dignity, his defense
of habeas corpus, his efforts to preserve the wall between church and
State, his defense of free speech in those relatively rare settings when
he was unable to persuade a majority of the Court to embrace his
vision of the First Amendment, his endorsement of carefully targeted
affirmative action, his scholarly effort to reinterpret the Eleventh
Amendment all stand as reminders of what seemed unfinished business
to Justice Brennan.
   “Justice Brennan’s contribution to American thought is deeper than
substantive outcomes or doctrinal innovations. His passionate effort to
read the Bill of Rights in defense of the innate dignity of the individual,
not as an alienated island but as a participant in a democracy of equals,
has enriched our concept of judging.
   “Healthy debate will continue over the role of a constitutional judge
in a vibrant democracy, but time and debate can only enhance Justice
Brennan’s status as the archetype of a Justice passionately devoted to
individual rights.
   “Wherefore, it is accordingly
  “RESOLVED, that we, as representative members of the Bar of the
Supreme Court of the United States, express our deep sadness at the
death of Justice Brennan, our condolences to the Brennan family, and
our profound admiration for Justice Brennan’s matchless contributions
to the cause of human dignity; and it is further
 “RESOLVED, that the Solicitor General be asked to present these
Resolutions to the Court, and that the Attorney General be asked to
move that they be inscribed on the Court’s permanent record.”
   The Chief Justice said:
   “Thank you, Mr. Solicitor General. I recognize the Attorney General
of the United States.”
  Attorney General Reno addressed the Court as follows:
  “Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
  “The Bar of the Court met today to honor the memory of William J.
Brennan, Jr., Associate Justice of the Supreme Court from 1956 to 1990.
While recognizing Justice Brennan’s extraordinary contributions to
this Court and impact on the legal world in a wide variety of areas, I

                            FRIDAY, MAY 22, 1998                      827
will limit these remarks to just a few examples of Justice Brennan’s
contributions to constitutional jurisprudence.
   “Justice Brennan served on this Court for 34 years. His role was
central in the Court’s expansion during that era of the substance of the
Constitution’s protection of individual rights, as well as in the Court’s
strengthening of the remedies available for the enforcement of those
rights.
   “Justice Brennan’s contributions to the development of the law are
perhaps most striking in the Court’s free speech cases. In his opinion
for the Court in Speiser v. Randall, for example, Justice Brennan intro-
duced the concept of the chilling effect. Explaining that the man who
knows that he must bring forth proof and persuade another of the
lawfulness of his conduct necessarily must steer far wider of the unlaw-
ful zone than if the State must bear these burdens.
   “Six years later came New York Times v. Sullivan, one of the leading
free speech cases of this century. Justice Brennan articulated the fun-
damental principle of the opinion, and one of the foundations of this
Court’s First Amendment jurisprudence.
   “In oft-quoted language, he stated that the Court considers this case
against the background of a profound national commitment to the prin-
ciple that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and
wide open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and some-
times unpleasantly sharp attacks on Government and public officials.
   “New York Times v. Sullivan is a characteristic example of Justice
Brennan’s recognition that the provisions of the Bill of Rights and the
Civil War amendments embody core values and principles that remain
valid even where their vindication requires significant alteration in
hitherto accepted principles of State law.
   “In NAACP v. Button, the Court held that the State of Virginia
could not prohibit NAACP lawyers from giving legal advice to citizens
of Virginia. Modern conceptions of vagueness and over-breadth trace
their roots to Justice Brennan’s opinion for the Court in this case,
which once again relied on the chilling effect rationale he had first
elaborated in Speiser.
   “In the two flag-burning cases that came before the Court in Justice
Brennan’s last two terms, Texas v. Johnson, and United States v. Eich-
man, Justice Brennan spoke for the Court in holding the statutes un-
constitutional. As Justice Brennan explained in Johnson: Our decision
is a reaffirmation of the principles of freedom and inclusiveness that
the flag best reflects, and of the conviction that our toleration of criti-
cisms such as Johnson’s is a sign and a source of our strength.

828                        FRIDAY, MAY 22, 1998

   “Justice Brennan was a leading exponent of the need to maintain
separation of church and State under the Establishment Clause, as
articulated in his influential concurring opinion in Abington School
District v. Schempp.
   “As he explained in that opinion, it is not only the nonbeliever who
fears the injection of sectarian doctrines and controversies into the
civil polity, but in as high degree it is the devout believer who fears
the secularization of a creed which becomes too deeply involved with,
and dependent upon, the Government.
   “Justice Brennan also spoke for the Court in a major Free Exercise
Clause case, Sherbert v. Verner, which eloquently set forth one side of
the debate regarding whether strict governmental neutrality is suffi-
cient to satisfy the constitutional command of the clause.
   “The same underlying philosophy provided the foundation for Justice
Brennan’s notable contribution to the jurisprudence of the Equal Pro-
tection Clause. As is by now well-known, he wrote most of the opinion,
signed by all nine members of the Court, in Cooper v. Aaron.
   “Justice Brennan’s seminal opinion upholding the constitutionality of
substantive provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in Katzenbach
v. Morgan marked a crucial milestone in the struggle for equal voting
rights, and in Thornburgh v. Gingles, Justice Brennan again wrote for
the Court in setting forth the basic analytical structure that would
govern the interpretation of the amended section 2 of the Voting
Rights Act.
   “Perhaps even more than in the area of race discrimination, Justice
Brennan’s application of the Equal Protection Clause in gender dis-
crimination cases has had a lasting impact on the law. In Frontiero v.
Richardson, Justice Brennan’s plurality opinion recognized that statu-
tory distinctions between the sexes often have the effect of invidiously
relegating the entire class of females to inferior legal status without
regard to the actual capabilities of its individual members.
   “Although he was writing only for a plurality in Frontiero, the Court
adopted Justice Brennan’s views in Craig v. Boren, as well as his fur-
ther articulation of the standard governing gender discrimination
under the Equal Protection Clause. Classifications by gender must
serve important governmental objectives, and must be substantially
related to the achievement of those objectives.
   “In his ground-breaking opinion for the Court in Goldberg v. Kelly,
Justice Brennan first applied due process standards to a State’s deci-
sion to terminate welfare payments.
JNL97$0522—06-12-98 13:29:51     JOURNAPGT          MILES




                           FRIDAY, MAY 22, 1998                     829
   “In Shapiro v. Thompson, Justice Brennan spoke for the Court in
striking down longstanding State residency requirements for welfare
as a burden on the right to travel.
   “In Eisenstadt v. Baird, Justice Brennan wrote an important opinion
that was a crucial stepping stone in the development of the right to
privacy, and in Penn Central Transportation Company v. New York
City, Justice Brennan set forth for the Court the fundamental analysis
that continues to govern the adjudication of claims that Government
regulation of private property constitutes a taking.
   “Justice Brennan’s contributions were not limited to civil cases. He
wrote for the Court in Malloy v. Hogan, holding that the Fifth Amend-
ment’s protection against compelled self-incrimination applied to the
States.
   “In In Re Winship, Justice Brennan, again writing for the Court,
articulated the central due process principle of proof beyond a reason-
able doubt in criminal cases.
   “In Bruton v. United States, the Court applied the Confrontation
Clause to defendants who were tried jointly.
   “An important element in Justice Brennan’s jurisprudence was his
belief that remedial avenues must be available to ensure that constitu-
tional protections can be enforced. For example, in Baker v. Carr, Jus-
tice Brennan wrote for the Court, holding that claims of malapportion-
ment in State legislatures were justiciable.
   “In Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of
Narcotics, Justice Brennan set forth for the Court the principles per-
mitting implication of a cause of action directly under the Constitution.
   “In Monell v. Department of Social Services, Justice Brennan wrote
an opinion for the Court opening the door to damage actions under 42
U. S. C. 1983 against municipal bodies for constitutional violations.
   “Of course, the Court has not always accepted Justice Brennan’s
views and, especially in his later years on the Court, he found himself
frequently in dissent. In light of the numerous areas of which Justice
Brennan’s work proved seminal in the development of the law in the
20th Century, the fact that the Court has not always agreed with his
views should come as no surprise, but it can be safely said that, as the
Court continues to address new problems in these areas, it will con-
tinue to confront the challenges presented by Justice Brennan.
   “Justice Brennan’s judicial philosophy was based on the need for con-
stant vigilance to apply the principles of human liberty embodied in
the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment to ever new arrange-
ments and new institutions. His vision of the Constitution as embody-

ing a fundamental charter of human liberty will endure and will con-
tinue to be reflected in this Court’s jurisprudence.”
   “Mr. Chief Justice, on behalf of the lawyers of this Nation and, in
particular, of the Bar of this Court, I respectfully request that the
Resolutions presented to you in honor and celebration of the memory
of Justice William J. Brennan, Jr., be accepted by the Court, and that
they, together with the chronicle of these proceedings, be ordered kept
for all time in the records of this Court.”
   The Chief Justice said:
   “Thank you, Attorney General Reno, thank you, General Waxman,
for your presentations today in memory of our late colleague and
friend, William J. Brennan.
   “We also extend to Chairman Burt Neuborne and the members of
the Committee on Resolutions, Chairman Daniel Rezneck and members
of the Arrangements Committee, Judge Abner Mikva, chairman of to-
day’s meeting of the Bar, our appreciation for the Resolutions you have
read today.
   “Your motion that they be made part of the permanent record of the
Court is hereby granted.
   “Bill Brennan’s service on this Court and his contributions to Ameri-
can law are an imposing achievement. He took the oath of office as a
Justice of this Court on October 16, 1956, at the age of 50. After fulfill-
ing his responsibilities under three Chief Justices and alongside 19 As-
sociate Justices, he retired on July 20, 1990, at the age of 84.
   “His period of service, just a couple of months short of 34 years, is
one that has been exceeded by only five other Justices in the 208-year
history of this Court’s existence, but Justice Brennan’s profound influ-
ence on American law can’t be measured simply by counting the num-
ber of years he sat in one of the chairs behind this bench.
   “An accurate assessment can only be made after one has studied
many of the 1,000-plus opinions he authored during his long career,
many of them landmark decisions by this Court. His majority opinions
alone number well over 400. These opinions, filling thousands of pages
of this Court’s official reports, demonstrate Justice Brennan’s scholarly
expertise, as well as his keen reasoning abilities.
   “In Baker v. Carr, for example, which the Resolutions comment on,
he wrote the opinion that for the first time subjected the apportion-
ment of State legislatures to the requirements of the Fourteenth
Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause.
   “Before this decision, controversies regarding the radically unequal
voting districts that existed at the time came to the Supreme Court
JNL97$0522—06-12-98 13:29:51      JOURNAPGT         MILES




                            FRIDAY, MAY 22, 1998                     831
under what is called the Republican Guarantee Clause. The Supreme
Court had declined to decide such cases because the Guarantee Clause
lacked judicially manageable standards which courts could utilize in
cases brought before them.
   “Malapportionment of State legislatures therefore had been consid-
ered political questions outside the Federal judiciary’s jurisdiction and,
while the Federal courts thus declined to address the problem, State
legislatures were also unwilling to act, because those who benefited
from the existing electoral system were the ones who were making
the law.
  “Justice Brennan cut this Gordian knot by shifting the issue of the
constitutionality of malapportionment from the Guarantee Clause to
the Equal Protection Clause. His opinion in Baker v. Carr took the first
step in the direction of the now well-accepted practice and principle of
one person, one vote, and in so doing changed the nature of American
politics forever.
  “Justice Brennan’s opinion for the Court in New York Times v. Sulli-
van, also commented on in the Resolutions, has a stature in our consti-
tutional history equal to that of Baker v. Carr, and as the Resolutions
indicate, prior to the Sullivan decision, slander and libel law were left
to the States, with few constitutional restrictions. These rules stifled
criticism of public officials, and the result was a less-informed public.
  “The Court in Sullivan, relying on freedom of speech and on what
Justice Brennan called our profound national commitment to the princi-
ple that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide
open, sharply changed these traditional rules of libel law. The Court’s
opinion held that any public official who was a plaintiff in a libel case
had to prove that the statements in question were defamatory, false,
and made with actual malice.
  “These developments in libel law altered the rules of the game of
American politics, and speech, as a matter of fact, making American
public officials more accountable, the American media more watchful,
and the American people better informed.
  “I’ve mentioned just two opinions that Justice Brennan authored
that have a special place in our Nation’s history. There are others that
have been mentioned in the Resolution, and I’m sure still others that
have not been mentioned by anyone today, because there were so many
of his opinions that played an important role in the development of
our law.

832                        FRIDAY, MAY 22, 1998

   “There are dozens of other significant opinions he wrote for the
Court, and yet the great body of law for which he was responsible may
be only but half of the contribution he made to this Court.
   “Those of us who had the pleasure of serving with Bill Brennan know
what a wonderful human being he was, combining a friendly spirit
with a highly analytical mind dedicated to justice. Blessed with such
attributes, Justice Brennan was a force for civility and good relation-
ship among his colleagues.
   “During some periods in the Court’s history, differences on constitu-
tional questions have affected personal relationships among the Jus-
tices and complicated the work of the Court. In contrast, Justice Bren-
nan was a unifying influence on the bench, often guiding the Court to
a majority or unanimous opinion.
   “And when the divisions on the Court on constitutional issues were
too deep and broad to be bridged, Justice Brennan never allowed such
disagreements to affect the way he treated his colleagues. Warm-
hearted, polite, courteous, Bill Brennan inspired these same qualities
in his colleagues, even those who disagreed with him.
   “His career exemplifies the happy truth that a judge need not be a
prima donna to have a lasting influence on our country’s laws. He will
have a high place in the annals of this Court and in its jurisprudence.”
