(JOURNAL)                 MONDAY, OCTOBER 5, 1998                     1
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

   Present: Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice Stevens, Justice O’Connor,
Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, Justice Souter, Justice Thomas, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer.
   The Chief Justice said:
   “I have the honor to announce, on behalf of the Court, that the Octo-
ber 1997 Term of the Supreme Court of the United States is now
closed, and the October 1998 Term is now convened.
   “As we open this morning, I want to pay tribute to our friend and
colleague, Lewis F. Powell, a retired Justice of this Court, who died on
August 25, 1998, at his home in Richmond, Virginia.
   “Lewis Powell took the Oath of Office on January 7, 1972, becoming
the 99th Justice to serve on this Court. He retired on June 26, 1987.
Following his retirement, he sat on the Court of Appeals for the Fourth
Circuit, and taught at both Washington and Lee and the University
of Virginia.
   “Justice Powell was born on September 19, 1907, in Suffolk, Virginia.
He graduated first in his class at Washington and Lee College in 1929,
then completed his law degree in two years and went on to receive his
LL.M. from Harvard Law School in 1932. In that year, he began prac-
ticing law in his native city of Richmond. In 1941, at the time of the
Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, he was 34 years old. Though his age
and family responsibilities would have excluded him from the draft, he
volunteered and was commissioned a First Lieutenant in the Air Force,
rising in rank to Colonel, and winning the Legion of Merit and Bronze
Star medals. He served overseas with distinction as an Intelligence
Officer in the Air Force for four years during World War II and its
aftermath.
   “After serving the country during the war, he returned to Richmond
and the law firm of Hunton and Williams. Throughout his career in
Virginia, he gave generously of his time and energy to the Richmond
community and to the Commonwealth. He served as the President of
the Virginia State Board of Education as well as Chairman of the Rich-
mond Public School Board. He was elected to serve as the President of
the American Bar Association and was appointed by President Johnson
as a member of the National Commission on Law Enforcement and
Administration of Justice.
   “At the age of 64, already occupying a secure place among the legal
leaders of the United States, his country called again and he accepted

an appointment to this Court as his patriotic duty. We who served
with him during his fifteen years on this Court cherished his intellect,
gentlemanly charm, and consummate judicial temperament. We con-
tinue to miss him. At an appropriate time in the spring, the traditional
memorial observance of the Court and the Bar of the Court will be
held in this Courtroom.
   “We have also suffered another loss within the past week. We note
with sadness today that the Supreme Court’s Public Information Offi-
cer, Toni House, died on September 29, 1998. She served the Court well
for sixteen years. We will miss her, and extend our condolences to
her family.
   “Today’s orders of the Court have been certified by The Chief Jus-
tice, filed with the Clerk, and will not be announced orally.”

(JOURNAL)                  MONDAY, MARCH 8, 1999                      599
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

   Present: Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice O’Connor, Justice Kennedy,
Justice Souter, Justice Thomas, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer.
   The Chief Justice said:
   “As we open this morning, I announce with sadness that our friend
and colleague Harry A. Blackmun, a former Justice of this Court, died
on Thursday morning, March 4, 1999, at Arlington Hospital, in Arling-
ton, Virginia.
   “Justice Blackmun was born in Nashville, Illinois, in 1908, and grew
up in St. Paul, Minnesota. He received a scholarship to Harvard where
he majored in mathematics and graduated summa cum laude. He re-
ceived his law degree from Harvard Law School in 1932.
   “Justice Blackmun began his legal career serving as a law clerk to
Judge John Sanborn on the United States Court of Appeals for the
Eighth Circuit. After his clerkship, he spent sixteen years in private
practice, specializing in taxation, litigation, wills, and estate planning.
He then became the first resident counsel at the Mayo Clinic in Roches-
ter, Minnesota, where he combined his love for law and medicine. In
1959, President Eisenhower nominated him to serve on the United
States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, filling the vacant seat
of Judge Sanborn for whom he had clerked 26 years earlier. After serv-
ing nine years on the Eighth Circuit, he was appointed by President
Nixon to a seat on the Supreme Court in June 1970.
   “Justice Blackmun was the 98th Justice to serve on the Court and
served for nearly a quarter of a century. He spoke for the Court in
more than 350 opinions. The publicity that the Roe v. Wade opinion
received may have obscured many other important decisions he au-
thored. Those include Mistretta v. United States, in which the Sentenc-
ing Guidelines were held to be constitutional; Daubert v. Merrell Dow
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., concerning the admissibility of scientific evi-
dence in federal courts; and Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Vir-
ginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., which opened new horizons on
First Amendment protection of commercial speech, to name just three.
He was a worthy successor to the predecessors in the seat which he
occupied—Joseph Story, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Benjamin Cardozo,
and Felix Frankfurter. He will be missed by his friends throughout the
judiciary and the country.
   “I speak for the members of this Court in expressing our profound
sympathy to Mrs. Blackmun, and his daughters Nancy, Sally, and

Susan, and to his grandchildren. The recess this Court takes today will
be in his memory. At an appropriate time, the traditional memorial
observance of the Court and the Bar of the Court will be held in this
Courtroom.”
   The Chief Justice said:
   “Today’s orders of the Court have been certified by The Chief Jus-
tice, filed with the Clerk, and will not be announced orally.”

(JOURNAL)                  TUESDAY, MAY 18, 1999                     825
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

   Present: Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice Stevens, Justice O’Connor,
Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, Justice Souter, Justice Thomas, and
Justice Ginsburg.
   The Chief Justice said:
   “The Court is in special session this afternoon to receive the Resolu-
tions of the Bar of the Supreme Court in tribute to our former col-
league and friend, Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.
   “The Court recognizes the Solicitor General.
   The Solicitor General addressed the Court as follows:
   “Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: At a meeting today
of the Bar of this Court, Resolutions memorializing our deep respect
and affection for Justice Powell were unanimously adopted. With the
Court’s leave, I shall summarize the Resolutions and ask that they be
set forth in their entirety in the records of the Court.

                            “RESOLUTION”

  “Born in 1907, Lewis Powell was raised in Richmond, Virginia. He
attended college and law school at Washington and Lee University, and
practiced law in Richmond for nearly 40 years, becoming the city’s
premier attorney and one of its foremost citizens. Much of the time he
spent building a corporate practice, but to an astonishing degree he
also dedicated himself to public service.
  “When the United States entered the Second World War, Lewis
Powell was too old to be drafted and he had at least three good reasons
not to volunteer. A loving wife and two beautiful daughters. But as
Lewis told Jo, ‘I never could have looked my children in the face if I
had ducked this responsibility.’ And Lewis Powell never ducked any
responsibility.
  “The Bar resolution details his extraordinary war service including
his critical work as a member of the Special Branch. When the war
ended, he returned home as a full colonel, with chest full of decorations.
There was no part of his career of which Lewis Powell was more proud.
  “Back home, he renewed the process of building a law practice, and
attending, pro bono, to the legal needs of many organizations in his
community. He became known as the leading ‘free’ lawyer in Richmond.
By far the most important—and controversial—of his public activities
was his stewardship of the Richmond public schools. Lewis Powell was

the chairman of the School Board when this Court announced its land-
mark decision in Brown v. Board of Education. Today, no other deci-
sion in this Court is more secure in moral standing or public esteem.
But in 1956, Senator Byrd, the acknowledged leader of Virginia politics,
called for ‘massive resistance.’ Virginia’s governor-elect vowed to:
‘Dedicate our every capacity to preserve segregation in the schools.’
The State prepared to shut down public schools altogether rather than
allow black and white children to sit together.
   “It was Lewis Powell’s fate to confront the hysteria of massive re-
sistance in the capital of the old Confederacy. Publicly he said nothing,
but behind the scenes he fought hard to keep the schools open. When
he stepped down from the School Board, integration had begun. Critics
complained about the pace of progress, but the schools had been kept
open.
   “In 1964, Lewis Powell became President of the American Bar Asso-
ciation, where he made three lasting accomplishments. He began a proj-
ect that produced the new Code of Professional Responsibility. He com-
menced a comprehensive study of standards for the administration of
criminal justice. And he called for a dramatic expansion of legal serv-
ices for the poor—a proposal that led to the birth of the Legal Serv-
ices Program.
   “He also became an increasingly prominent voice on crime, insisting
on the rule of law, criticizing civil disobedience from the left and the
right, and reminding everyone that the first duty of government is ‘to
protect citizens in their persons and property from criminal conduct—
whatever its source or cause.’ As a member of President Johnson’s
Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice,
he expressed his personal views in a ‘Supplemental Statement’ to the
Commission’s report, establishing himself as a respectful, but unmis-
takably conservative, critic of the Warren Court’s criminal procedure
decisions.
   “Three times Lewis Powell declined invitations to be considered for
nomination to the Supreme Court, citing his age and a concern that his
nomination might provoke divisive opposition. Only when President
Nixon personally called and invoked his duty to the nation, did Lewis
Powell acquiesce.
   “During his 15 years on this Court, Justice Powell found himself at
the political center. Often, his was the decisive voice—the voice of a
thoughtful moderate, steadfast in firm convictions but respectful of
compromise, mindful of context, and distrustful of sweeping
generalization.

                          TUESDAY, MAY 18, 1999                     827
   “The resolution addresses three areas, abortion, affirmative action,
and capital punishment that revealed Justice Powell’s exceptional im-
pact on the development of American Constitutional Law. In each he
sought to bring his understanding of constitutional principles and con-
stitutional precedents, and his instinct for a middle course, to bear on
deeply difficult questions that continue to divide this country.
   “Justice Powell was in the majority in Roe v. Wade, and in every
other abortion decision during his tenure. On the one hand, he stead-
fastly supported Roe against challenges and limitations, including at-
tempts to require a parent’s or husband’s consent. But, on the other he
upheld laws requiring an unmarried minor to notify her parents, and
he consistently refused to order public funding abortion. Perhaps, more
than those of any other, Justice Powell’s votes determined the scope of
the constitutional right to abortion.
   “So also with affirmative action. In the famous Bakke decision, Jus-
tice Powell made a ‘majority of one’ to tolerate racial preferences in
higher education but only as a temporary and contested deviation from
the ideal of color-blindness. Four Justices were prepared to allow mi-
nority preferences more or less without limitation, and four others in-
terpreted a federal statute to disallow them more or less without ex-
ception. Justice Powell cast the deciding vote in both directions. On
the one hand, he thought it necessary that affirmative steps be permit-
ted to overcome America’s long history of racial oppression. On the
other hand, he feared the entrenchment of a racial and ethnic spoils
system that would prove permanently durable and socially divisive.
Characteristically, Justice Powell sought a middle course. He tried to
permit racial preferences without conceding their future, to authorize
such objections while preserving the grounds of objection to them.
   “The middle ground staked out in Bakke was filled by 13 additional
affirmative action decisions during his tenure. In all of them, Justice
Powell was in the majority. In all of them, he struck a delicate balance.
Both sides owe something to the lonely wisdom of Lewis Powell.
   “Furman v. Georgia was argued only 10 days after Justice Powell
took his seat on this Court. His forceful dissent argued that the death
penalty should be upheld. When a majority of the Justices nevertheless
determined to strike down existing laws, 35 States promptly enacted
new ones, and 17 made death mandatory for certain broad classes of
homicide.
   “In 1976, the Court heard five cases addressing a representative
sample of the new statutes. Four Justices voted to uphold all the stat-
utes; two voted to strike them all down. The balance of power rested

with Justices Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, who issued a joint opinion
inaugurating the constitutional regime that has continued until today.
   “Abortion, affirmative action, and captial punishment remain deeply
divisive and controversial. Perhaps many would not unreservedly en-
dorse Justice Powell’s position on all three questions, but we are united
in our respect and admiration for the man who produced them.
   “His perspective was grounded in the realism of practical experience
and leavened by the decency, magnanimity, and dedication he brought
to his Office.
   “Wherefore, it is accordingly
   “RESOLVED that we, as representative members of the Bar of the
Supreme Court of the United States, express our admiration and re-
spect for Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr., our sadness at his death, and our
condolences to his family, and it is further
   “RESOLVED that the Solicitor General be asked to present these
resolutions to the Court and that the Attorney General be asked to
move that they be inscribed on the Court’s permanent records.”
   The Chief Justice said:
   “The Court recognizes the Attorney General of the United States.”
   Attorney General Reno addressed the Court as follows:
   “Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
   “Although his courtly manners and quiet confidence would lead oth-
ers to think of him as a patrician, Lewis Powell was not born to wealth.
His father worked hard as a manager in a series of businesses when
he was a child, and provided opportunities to Lewis, Jr., that he himself
had not had. As a schoolboy, Lewis Powell received an award for per-
sonal integrity, an honor that would repeatedly be re-won in respect
others had for him throughout his life.
   “The Solicitor General has already described portions of the Bar
resolution that detail Lewis Powell’s splendid reputation at the Bar
and his tireless efforts in public service of all kinds—including his
chairmanship of the Richmond School Board during a time of unpara-
lled challenge; his lasting initiatives as President of the American Bar
Association; and his exceptional service to this country in World War
II. Each of these voluntary efforts would be reason enough for the
country to extol the memory of Lewis Powell.
   “It is also fitting, I think, to mention that he also held the highest
offices of the American Bar Association and the American College of
Trial Lawyers. He served, as the Solicitor General has noted, as a
member of President Johnson’s Commission on Law Enforcement and
the Administration of Justice, President Nixon’s Blue Ribbon Defense

                            TUESDAY, MAY 18, 1999                      829
Panel, the National Advisory Committee on Legal Services to the Poor,
the Virginia Constitutional Revision Commission, the Board of Trust-
ees of Washington and Lee University, and the Colonial Williamsburg
Foundation.
   “It is fair to say that Lewis Powell, the Supreme Court Justice drew
deeply from the experience of Lewis Powell, the attorney. He brought
a cautious and highly sophisticated pragmatism to the Court, and a
distrust of doctrinaire prescriptions for complex problems. He charac-
teristically focused on the facts of the case before the Court, striving
to do justice in that case as well as fashion rules of general applicability
to govern other, similar circumstances. When occasionally the effort to
achieve a just result on the given facts implied creation of a new rule
of uncertain consequences, Justice Powell strove to do justice in the
case while endeavoring to limit the breadth of the Court’s decision.
The informed ‘balancing’ of competing interests became his hallmark
as a Justice. Particularly on the great issues that tended to divide the
country, Justice Powell’s capacity to find important elements of truth
and justice on each side of the controversy became a powerful source
of reconciliation and healing.
   “From the time he joined the Court in January of 1972 until his
retirement in June 1987, Justice Powell wrote more than 600 opinions,
approximately half of them for the Court. Within a short time after
his appointment, Justice Powell was writing some of the Court’s most
important opinions. In his very first Term, he wrote the Court’s opinion
in Kastigar v. United States, which established the ground rules for
the modern application of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-
incrimination in the context of immunized testimony.
   “Also within months of his appointment, Justice Powell demon-
strated his independence from the President who had appointed him
by writing for the Court in United States v. United States District
Court. In that case the Court rejected the government’s assertion of
an executive power to wiretap persons without judicial supervision in
cases involving national security. But as his opinion for the Court in
Dalia v. United States would later demonstrate, the use of a warrant-
less entry to install eavesdropping equipment would not in and of itself
give rise to a Fourth Amendment violation so long as th officers had
received the approval of a judge for the wiretapping itself.
   “Another decision from his early years on the Court, Almedia-
Sanchez v. United States would later develop into a series of Fourth
Amendment decisions prescribing carefully nuanced rules to govern
searches and seizures at the Nation’s borders. Those decisions included
JNL98$0518—06-30-00 15:25:18      JOURNAPGT         MILES




830                        TUESDAY, MAY 18, 1999

United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, United States v. Ortiz, and United
States v. Martinez-Fuerte. A similarly balanced approach can be found
in Justice Powell’s opinions in a series of cases dealing with the scope
of the exclusionary rule.
   “Justice Powell was an especially authoritative voice in cases involv-
ing public education. In his second Term, he wrote the Court’s decision
in San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, holding that
a publicly-funded education is not a fundamental right triggering strict
scrutiny of the financial disparities that may exist between rich and
poor school districts. Yet the deference in Rodriguez to local control of
public education was counterbalanced a decade later by the Court’s
holding that a state law prohibiting the children of undocumented
aliens from attending public school violated the Constitution. Justice
Powell wrote in his concurring opinion in Plyler v. Doe, ‘The classifica-
tion at issue deprives a group of children of the opportunity for educa-
tion afforded all other children simply because they have been assigned
a legal status due to a violation of law by their parents. These children,
thus, have been singled out for a lifelong penalty and stigma. A legisla-
tive classification that threatens the creation of an underclass of future
citizens and residents cannot be reconciled with one of the fundamental
purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment.’
   “Similarly, in a series of opinions under the Equal Protection Clause
involving gender discrimination, Justice Powell applied mid-level scru-
tiny with telling effect—resulting in the Court’s invalidation of
gender-based discrimination in the military, the ability of pregnant
teachers to work, the dissemination of social security benefits, the sale
of 3.2 beer, and the rules requiring consent for adoption by an unwed
mother but not an unwed father.
   “Justice Powell will, of course, long be remembered for his eloquent
opinion in the Bakke case, which struck down racial quotas but upheld
the use of race as a factor in determining who will be admitted to a
state professional school. His opinion, although not joining in its en-
tirety by any other Justice, controlled the outcome of the case and
serves to this day as a beacon for all who would seek to find construc-
tive common ground on issues of profound divisiviness.
   “In many other areas of the law, Justice Powell’s opinions for the
court have left an enduring legacy. He was a leading voice in the
Court’s modern antitrust jurisprudence. His opinion in Batson v. Ken-
tucky struck down the use of peremptory challenges to jurors on the
basis of race. His opinion in Mathews v. Eldridge established the essen-
tial rules of procedural due process that continue to determine the
JNL98$0518—06-30-00 15:25:18      JOURNAPGT         MILES




                           TUESDAY, MAY 18, 1999                     831
constitutionality of governmental restrictions on a person’s rights to
liberty or property. His opinion in Village of Arlington Heights v. Met-
ropolitan Housing Development Corporation made clear that while
discriminatory impact alone is insufficient to establish a constitutional
violation, an intent to discriminate is susceptible of proof in practical
ways. And in Central Hudson Gas & Electric Company v. Public Serv-
ice Commission, Justice Powell’s opinion articulated the essential cri-
teria for evaluating the validity of governmental restrictions on com-
mercial speech.
   “There are many other areas in which Justice Powell’s views helped
to shape this Court’s jurisprudence. For example, in 44 cases involving
the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment, Justice Powell was in
the majority 93 percent of the time—by far the highest percentage of
any Justice with whom he served. As the Solicitor General has noted,
in the abortion cases decided during his tenure, he was in the majority
100 percent of the time, from Roe v. Wade through Thornburgh v.
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, even as the con-
tentious issues of consent, public funding, and state restrictions com-
manded different majorities on the Court.
   “Lewis Powell recognized, in his many areas of endeavor, that indi-
viduals can make a significant difference in this world. The attributes
that marked his life journey are ones everyone can admire: his determi-
nation in finding solutions to human problems, his unfailing courtesy
to others, and his dedication to achieving results that helped diverse
factions find common ground.
   “Mr. Chief Justice, on behalf of the lawyers of this Nation and partic-
ularly the Bar of this Court, I respectfully request that the Resolutions
presented to you be accepted by this Court, and that they, together
with the chronicle of these proceedings, be ordered kept for all time in
the records of this Court.”
   The Chief Justice said:
   “Thank you, Attorney General Reno, thank you General Waxman for
your presentation today in memory of our late friend and colleague,
Lewis Powell.
   “We also extend to Chairman John Jeffries and the members of the
Committee on Resolutions, Chairman William Kelly and the members

Klein, Chairman of today’s meeting of the Supreme Court Bar, our
appreciation for the Resolutions you have provided today. Your motion

public office sought him. As the Bar Resolutions and the Attorney Gen-
eral have noted, Lewis Powell had a firmly established reputation as a
leader of the Bar of his native Richmond, of his native State of Virginia,
and of the United States.
   “Of 16 Justices, with whom I have served in more than 27 years on
the Court, I think that only 2 would be long remembered in the annals
of legal history had they not been appointed to the Supreme Court.
Thurgood Marshall was one, and Lewis Powell was the other. Thurgood
Marshall would have been remembered for the prominent up-front role
he played in litigating landmark civil rights cases in the 1940’s and
1950’s. Lewis Powell would have been remembered for his building of
Hunton & Williams into a national firm in a city the size of Richmond,
Virginia, as president of the American Bar Association, president of
the American College of Trial Lawyers, and a member of several blue-
ribbon commissions. Byron White would have been remembered for
his athletic accomplishments, but as for the rest of us; had we not been
appointed to the Supreme Court, we would have been perhaps more
affluent, but certainly less well known.
   “Lewis Powell was a bear for work. During his 15 year tenure, he
wrote over 600 opinions. The Bar Resolutions, the Solicitor General,
and the Attorney General have pointed out the major contributions
that Justice Powell made to the body of decisional law during his 15
year tenure on this Court. Virtually all of the opinions thus mentioned
decide questions of constitutional law, and it is understandable that
this should be so. I want to point out one opinion which Lewis Powell
wrote that did not involve a constitutional question, but which is prob-
ably the most frequently cited opinion in briefs today of any opinion
from the Court.
   “That case is Harlow v. Fitzgerald, which decided in 1982. There we
held in an opinion by Justice Powell that high ranking officials of the
Executive Branch—and that holding has since been extended to most
public officials exercising discretionary authority—are entitled to qual-
ified immunity against suits for damages. More importantly, the quali-
fied immunity is to be based on the objective reasonableness of the
actions of the officials. Before Harlow, there was a subjective element
involved which as a practical matter prevented summary judgment
before discovery in just about every case.
   “As the Bar Resolutions have pointed out, but I none the less would
like to emphasize the Supreme Court appointment was not the first

call to duty heeded by Lewis Powell. In 1941, at the time of the attack
on Pearl Harbor, he was 34 years old, 7 years out of law school, and a
partner at Hunton and Williams. He had two children at the time, and
would have been excluded from the draft, but he nonetheless volun-
teered and was commissioned a First Lieutenant in the U. S. Army Air
Force. He rose in rank to Colonel, he won the Legion of Merit and the
Bronze Star, serving overseas with distinction as an Intelligence Offi-
cer in the Air Force for four years during World War II and its
aftermath.
  “He served here at the Court with equal distinction. He brought a
rare combination of ability, fair-mindedness, and grace to the Court.
He had the consummate judicial temperament. His capacity and will-
ingness to see both sides of an issue, and his manner in persuading
others to his own views resulted in his extraordinary influence during
his tenure here.
  “Those of us who served with him during his 15 years on the Court
cherished his intellect and gentlemanly charm. He managed to present
his views in Conference forcefully without departing from his naturally
gracious manner, particularly towards colleagues who expressed op-
posing views. Those of us who served with him continue to miss him.
Our Nation is the better for his having served it in the many ways that
he did.”
