Mr. Attorney-General Olney addressed the court as follows:
The bar, may it please the court, have requested me to present the
resolutions lately adopted by them upon the occasion of the death of Mr.
Justice Blatchford. They are as follows:
Mr. Justice Blatchford has closed a judicial career of over twenty-five
years. Appointed in 1867 to the bench, as district judge for the southern
district of New York, he brought to the discharge of his judicial duties
capacity for labor and habits of exhaustive research acquired during his
experience for nine years at the bar in the quiet town of Auburn, together
with the qualities of promptness in dispatch of business and quickness of
apprehension that had been cultivated by thirteen years of active practice
in the city of New York. His labors as district judge will live in the shape
and form that the law of bankruptcy and of admiralty received from his
judicial hand. Later, from 1872 until 1882, as circuit judge, the law of
patents especially owes much in its development to his patient research
and faithful exposition. Appointed to the bench of the Supreme Court
of the United States in 1882, he brought to the discharge of his high
duties an intellect trained and disciplined by his former labors in direc-
tions especially adapted to increase his usefulness in his new sphere. In
this great tribunal he was distinguished as theretofore for his careful study
of his cases, his patient and full statements of facts, and his learned and
luminous expositions of the law. Always he wrought to the full measure
of his strength. He gave to the service of his chosen profession and of
his country all that was best of himself. He concentrated all his energies
upon hìs judicial duties. Neither pleasure nor change of mental occupa-
tion had much charm for him. His life work was the discharge of the
functions of a judge and all his powers were concentrated to this lofty
end.

50
Resolved, That in the death of Mr. Justice Blatchford, his friends have
lost a kind and amiable companion, his profession a conscientious and
earnest brother, the Supreme Court of the United States a faithful, able,
and industrious member, and the people of these United States an honest
judge.
Resolved, That the Attorney-General be requested to lay this minute and
these resolutions before the court, and to ask that they be spread upon the
record.
Resolved, That the chairman be requested to transmit a copy of them
to the family of Mr. Justice Blatchford.
These resolutions-as I am sure the court will agree-justly estimate
and express the loss sustained, not merely by the judiciary, not merely by
the profession, but by the entire community as well. It does not follow
that the community is necessarily or even probably sensible of its loss.
Judge Blatchford bore his high honors so meekly, fulfilled his impor-
tant functions so quietly and unostentatiously, as to attract to himself
but slight notice from the public he so faithfully served. Nothing, in-
deed, was more alien to his thoroughly genuine nature than the mere
trappings of office, than the notoriety and conspicuousness which in
these days of the interviewer and the illustrated daily press so easily
become the inseparable attendants of high station. Judge Blatchford
was the model of a competent, well trained, laborious, conscientious,
and, above all, modest public servant. It is not given to every man
to be instinct with true genius, to exult in acknowledged intellectual
superiority, to be chief among the chiefs of his chosen calling. Such mėn
are rare and their examples as often provoke despair as excite to emula-
tion. But to every man it is given to make the most of the faculties that
he has, to cultivate them with unflagging diligence, to make sure that
they deteriorate neither from misuse nor disuse, but continue in ever
growing strength and efficiency until the inevitable access of years and
infirmities inexorably bars all further progress. By such means alone,
without the aid of any transcendent powers, it is astonishing to what
heights men have climbed, what conquests they have made, and what
laurels they have won. Judge Blatchford would have been the last to
claim for himself those extraordinary gifts which have made some men
seem and be called the giants of the law. But he had tireless industry,.
persistent application, a determination to work the powers he possessed
to their utmost capacity, and the result is now seen in an honorable
judicial career on the bench of the highest court of the country and in
an example full of encouragement and promise for every ambitious and
struggling spirit. If it be asked what was Judge Blatchford's chief
characteristic as a judge, it may be said to consist in the strictly busi-

51
ness quality of his work. By that I do not merely mean that he
was specially conversant with the multifarious affairs of trade as daily
transacted in the commercial centers of the world, and dealt with the ques-
tions arising out of them with peculiar intelligence and skill. No less
could be expected of one who came to the bench from a successful prac-
tice in the commercial metropolis of the country. But his judicial work
was businesslike, in that its sole aim was the right determination of the
particular case in hand. He never made its decision an occasion
for philosophic disquisition. He never undertook by an opinion in one
case to settle principles for other anticipated cases. He never indulged
in "large discourse looking before and after," much less in any flights of
rhetoric. It satisfied his idea of judicial duty that the controversy before
him was settled aright by the application of a rule of law broad enough
to cover that case. Thus, if he was not brilliant, he was safe; if he did
not make large contributions to the science of jurisprudence, he won re-
spect for the law and its administration by the uniform righteousness of
the results reached in actual causes. It must add to our admiration of
Judge Blatchford that he toiled assiduously, both at the bar and on the
bench, not from necessity, but from choice; that the allurements of an
ample fortune neither belittled his aims nor benumbed his energies, and
that in his hands wealth was but the supplement and aid to an industry
and zeal rarely excelled even under the spur of poverty. His orderly,
prosperous, and placid career, notable in itself, is even more so by con-
trast with that of his colleague on the bench whose death preceded his
own by only a few months. Judge Blatchford rose to the highest of
professional honors by unswervingly treading the beaten path of the law
and by a regularly-graduated ascent, every stage of which, from country
lawyer to city lawyer, from district judge to circuit judge, and from cir-
cuit judge to judge of the Supreme Court, was in natural and logical
succession. Mr. Justice Lamar, on the other hand, was called to the like
honors after a career of extraordinary vicissitudes, in which the life of the
camp and the battlefield alternated with that of the forum and the hust-
ings; almost without probation as a legal practitioner, but with a thorough
theoretical and practical knowledge of great affairs of State and with a well-
earned national renown as an orator, statesman, and leader of men.
nothing could better illustrate the wide scope and variety of the functions
of this high tribunal than the fact that, notwithstanding their wholly
diverse training and experience, each of them found here a fitting field for
his own peculiar gifts and attainments, and each in his own line proved
himself an accession and an ornament to the bench. I have the honor to
ask that the resolutions of the bar be spread upon the records of the court.
And

52.
The Chief Justice responded:
To Mr. Justice Blatchford the discharge of duty was an impulse, and
toil a habit; and since to thorough training as a scholar and in profes-
sional practice, a wide and varied knowledge of the law, a keen and dis-
criminating intellect, and an indomitable patience, he added "the trans-
cendent capacity of taking trouble," the volume and extent of the work
he was enabled to accomplish during twenty-six years of judicial life
should occasion no surprise.
If his death admonishes us of the swiftness of the passage of time, his
example teaches, through the results of the orderly method which regu-
lated his every action, how time may be redeemed.
Mr. Justice Blatchford was at home in every branch of the jurisdiction
of the courts in which he sat. It is not easy to distinguish, where all
was done so well, but it may be justly said that he displayed uncommon
aptitude in the administration of the maritime law and of the law of
patents, his grasp upon the original principles of the one and his mastery
of details in the other aiding him in largely contributing to the develop-
ment of both. His experience in adjudication and in affairs bore abun-
dant fruit during his incumbency of a seat upon this bench, and in the
domain of constitutional investigation and exposition he won new laurels.
As suggested by the Attorney-General, he did not attempt in his judg-
ments to "bestow conclusions on after-generations," yet when the four
hundred and thirty opinions, to be precise as he would have been, in which
he spoke for the court, contained in the volumes of our reports from the
latter part of the one hundred and fifth to the close of the one hundred
and forty-ninth, are examined, it will be found that he dealt with large
questions, in many of them, with a breadth and luminousness of treatment
and at the same time with a circumspection and sagacity which entitle
them to high rank as judicial compositions, and will make them monu-
ments to be seen hereafter of those concerned in looking about them for
guidance in the present by the wisdom of the past.
And, as rightly indicated in the thoughtful tributes paid to him to-day,
the memory of this conscientious and faithful public servant will be per-
petuated, not through his decisions alone, but in the profound conviction,
the contemplation of his career will ever produce, that he kept, to use the
language of another, the great picture of the useful and distinguished
judge "constantly before his eyes, and to a resemblance of which all his
efforts, all his thoughts, all his life were devoted."
Upon the loss to us personally in parting with this beloved friend and
helpful fellow-laborer we do not care to dwell. We take up our burdens
again, conscious of the absence of the relief his participation would have
afforded, but feeling as to him the truthfulness of the thought: "Above

53
all, believe it, the sweetest canticle is Nunc Dimittis, when a man hath
obtained worthy ends and expectations."
The minute and resolutions of the bar and the remarks of the Attorney-
General will be entered on our records, and as a further mark of respect
the court will adjourn until to-morrow at the usual hour.
Adjourned until to-morrow at 12 o'clock.
