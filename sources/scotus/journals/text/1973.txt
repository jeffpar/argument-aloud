The Chief Justice said:
Laytonsville, Md. Joseph Andrew
"Before we hear the first argument this morning, we would like to
take note for the permanent journal and records of the Court of an
important event in the history of the Court.
"One week ago today, on October 29th, Mr. Justice Douglas estab-
lished a new longevity record for service on The Supreme Court of the
United States: thirty-four years, one hundred and ninety-six days, as
of that day.
"His tenure as a Justice of this Court now exceeds that of Mr. Jus-
tice Stephen Field, who was appointed by President Lincoln, took his
oath of office in 1863, on May 20th, and remained on the Court until
December 1, 1897.
"I know I speak for all the members of the Court, and for the re-
tired and former members of the Court, when we take this occasion to
wish our Brother Douglas continued good health and long life and
to record our congratulations on the new record which he has estab-
lished and will proceed to break every day when he arrives at the
Court in the morning."

"1. When a trial judge summarily imposes consecutive sentences on
eight counts of contempt aggregating four and one-half years' im-
prisonment, including sentences of one year's imprisonment on two
counts, whether he or the appellate court may subsequently, in order
to defeat the alleged contemnor's right to trial by jury, reduce the sen-
tences so that the sentence on no one count exceeds six months' im-
prisonment and direct that the sentences run concurrently for a total
of six months' imprisonment?
"2. When alleged contempts have been committed by an attorney in
the presence of the trial judge and the trial judge proceeds summarily
to punish for contempt, whether due process requires that the at-
torney be given some opportunity to be heard in defense or mitigation
before he is finally adjudged guilty and sentence is imposed?

ment require that an accused be afforded the right to a jury trial?"

OPINION
No. 72-914. Sarah Scheuer, Administratrix, etc., petitioner, v.
James Rhodes et al.; and
No. 72-1318. Arthur Krause, Administrator of the Estate of
Allison Krause, et al., petitioners, v. James Rhodes et al. On writs of
certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.
Judgment reversed and cases remanded to the Court of Appeals for
further proceedings in conformity with the opinion of this Court.
Opinion by Mr. Chief Justice Burger. Mr. Justice Douglas took no
part in the decision of this case.
The Chief Justice said:
"Before we proceed with the arguments that we interrupted at the
close of the session yesterday, I would like to make a very brief
statement.
"Today marks an event in the history of this Court that has never
occurred before, and may never occur again.
"It is also a milestone in the unique judicial career of Mr. Justice
Douglas, who, on October 29, 1973, established a record of the longest
service of any one of the one hundred Justices who have served on
this Court, in the one hundred and eighty-four years since the Court
first sat on February 2, 1790.
540-278-74-90



WEDNESDAY, APRIL 17, 1974
485
"It was precisely thirty-five years ago today that Mr. Justice
Douglas took his seat on this Court.
"A great many people exceed the Biblical three-score-and-ten and
go on to eighties and the nineties and even beyond that, but few of
them do so with the remarkable vigor and the full zest for life that
Justice Douglas exhibits. His curiosity and concern about the world
we live in and all that is in it and his search to satisfy that curiosity
seems to increase with each passing year.
"This week he publishes his seventeenth book, an account of his early
years in Minnesota, in the State of Washington, then back east to
New York, and later at New Haven, and then in Washington, where
he came to spend four or five months and has remained forty years.
"Anyone who thinks Justice Douglas is nearing the end of his
career overlooks the reality of his life and his temperament. There
are many more mountains to climb, mountains of the Law, mountains
of life and of nature, and that will always be his pursuit.
"On October 29 last year, when Justice Douglas surpassed all the
prior records of service, he made a statement that ought to be placed
in the permanent records of this Court, and I will take this occasion.
to do so.
"He said this:
'I think the heart of America is sound. I think the conscience of
America is bright. I think the future of America is great. The thing
that holds us all together is not the wording of the Constitution, but
the mucilage of good will, and that is what we need at all times."
"I know, Mr. Justice Douglas, our Brother Douglas, that I speak
for all the members of the Court as well as for our retired brethren,
Mr. Chief Justice Warren, Justices Reed and Clark, and former mem-
bers of the Court with whom you sat, when I say that we salute you
on this occasion, and wish you good health and the continued vigor
that has been your trademark for all these years."

it is my sad duty to take note for the Record and the Journal of this

service of more than a half-century, a career that has few parallels in
modern time.
"I speak for all the present and former members of the Court today
in expressing our deep sorrow at his death, and our profound sym-
pathy for Mrs. Warren and her family.
"On an appropriate occasion after the opening of the next Term
of the Court, a memorial service will be conducted for Chief Justice
Warren in this Chamber."
