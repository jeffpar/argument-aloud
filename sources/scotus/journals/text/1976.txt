SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Present: Mr. Chief Justice Burger, Mr. Justice Brennan, Mr.
Justice Stewart, Mr. Justice White, Mr. Justice Marshall, Mr. Justice
Blackmum, Mr. Justice Powell, Mr. Justice Rehniquist, and Mr.
Justice Stevens.
ORDER IN PENDING CASE
No. A-423. Oklahoma Publishing Company, applicant, v. District
Court in for Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, et al. This is a renewed
application for partial stay of a pretrial order of the District Court
of Oklahoma County, Oklahoma, pending filing and disposition of a
petition for certiorari. The order enjoined law enforcement officials
and other public employees, as well as prosecution and defense counsel
"from disclosing any information or making any comment concern-
ing" a delinquency proceeding then pending in that court against a
juvenile. The order also restrained all members of the news media
from "publishing, broadcasting or disseminating in any manner, the
name or picture of said minor child in connection with this pending
case." On application for prohibition and mandamus challenging the
restraint on the press, the Oklahoma Supreme Court sustained the
order. The application for stay here filed by Oklahoma Publishing
Company also challenges only the injunction against publishing the
name and picture of the minor. It does not challenge the restraint on
counsel or public employees; nor does it challenge the Oklahoma
statute requiring juvenile proceedings to be held in private unless
specifically ordered by the judge to be open to the public.
It appearing that the name and picture of the minor involved in
this case were made available to the public as a result of a hearing
held at the outset of this case which was in fact open to the press, the
application for stay of the order enjoining publication of the name or
picture of the minor, presented to Mr. Justice White and by him
referred to the Court, is granted pending the timely filing and dis-
position of a petition for certiorari unless earlier terminated by
further order of the Court. Nebraska Press Ass'n. v. Stuart, No. 75-
817, decided June 30, 1976, slip opinion p. 27; Cox Broadcasting Corp.
v. Cohn, 420 U.S. 469, 491, 495 (1975). Mr. Justice Brennan, while
not subscribing to this order, would also grant the stay.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

Justice Stewart, Mr. Justice White, Mr. Justice Marshall, Mr. Justice
Blackmun, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, Mr. Justice Powell, and Mr. Justice
Stevens.
ORDER IN PENDING CASE
No. A-683. Melvin James Dixon, applicant, v. Vinson Thompson,
Warden, et al. On application for a writ of habeas corpus. Dixon has
filed a motion, addressed to Mr. Justice Stewart as Circuit Justice,
and by him referred to the Court, for leave to file a petition for a
writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2241 (b), 1651 (a), and Su-
preme Court Rules 31 and 50. On January 27, 1977, the District
Court for the Middle District of Tennessee denied Dixon's habeas
corpus petition. Dixon has not appealed from that denial, but the
record reveals that the time for appeal has not expired.
This Court does not, absent exceptional circumstances, exercise its
jurisdiction to issue writs of habeas corpus when an adequate remedy
may be had in a lower federal court. Ex Parte Abernathy, 320 U.S.
219 (1943); Ex Parte Tracy, 249 U.S. 551 (1919). Since an appeal
from the judgment of the District Court may still be had and since
there appear to be no exceptional circumstances justifying exercise of
this Court's discretionary jurisdiction, the motion is denied. Denial
of the motion is not an adjudication on the merits, and is made with-
out prejudice to alternative or subsequent applications for relief. Ex
Parte Abernathy, supra; Ex Parte Tracy, supra.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Present: Mr. Chief Justice Burger, Mr. Justice Brennan, Mr. Jus-
tice Stewart, Mr. Justice White, Mr. Justice Marshall, Mr. Justice.
Blackmun, Mr. Justice Powell, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, and Mr. Jus-
tice Stevens.
The Chief Justice said:
"Before we proceed today with the regular business of the Court,
it is my sad duty to take note for the record and the Journal of the
Court of the death of our beloved colleague and friend Mr. Justice
Tom Clark, who served as a Justice of this Court from 1949 to 1967,
after serving as Attorney General of the United States from 1945 to
1949.
"His death came almost exactly 10 years after retiring from this
Court. But retirement for Justice Clark was not the end but the
beginning of a new career in which he was a leading spokesman for
judicial improvement and which, at the same time, took him on
special assignments into every one of the 11 Federal Circuits. So far
as we are aware, no Judge or Justice in history sat on every Court of
Appeals after his technical retirement from active service.
"Even while sitting on this Court Justice Clark was a literal mis-
sionary for improvement of judicial administration, and it was logi-
cal that, when the Federal Judicial Center began operations in 1968,
he was appointed its first Director. In that position, he gave standing
and credibility to this important new institution created by Congress
to improve the administration of justice.
"When he retired as Director, he resumed regular sittings on Courts
of Appeals and District Courts all over the United States. And for
the past 15 years he has had a part in every major program to im-
prove the work of the courts. He played a leading role in launching
the National College of the State Judiciary at Reno, Nev., where
more than 1,000 State judges have received special training in the
past decade.
"Last Saturday he was in his Chambers here at the Supreme Court,
completing his preparation for cases he was to hear argued in the
United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York.
When he did not arrive at the Court of Appeals on Monday morning,
it was discovered that his death occurred during the night.
"He died as he lived, deeply committed and involved in the judicial
work he loved—and literally, in the tradition of the West-‘with his
boots on'."

THURSDAY, JUNE 16, 1977
"No one in the past 30 years has done more than Tom Clark to
improve justice in our country and no one had such universal respect
and affection of the lawyers and judges of this country.
"I speak for all the present and former members of the Court today
in expressing our deep sorrow, and our profound sympathy, for
Mrs. Clark and her family.
