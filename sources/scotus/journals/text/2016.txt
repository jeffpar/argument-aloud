SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

   Present: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Kennedy, Justice Thomas,
Justice Alito, and Justice Sotomayor.
   The Chief Justice said:
   “I have the honor to announce, on behalf of the Court that the Octo­
ber 2015 Term of the Supreme Court of the United States is now
closed, and the October 2016 Term is now convened.
   “Today’s orders of the Court have been duly entered and certiﬁed,
and ﬁled with the Clerk.”

                Certiorari—Summary Dispositions
   No. 15–1493. Ruthie Michelle Mann, Petitioner v. North Dakota. On
petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of North Dakota.
Petition for writ of certiorari granted. Judgment vacated, and case
remanded to the Supreme Court of North Dakota for further consider­
ation in light of Birchﬁeld v. North Dakota, 579 U. S. ––– (2016).
   No. 15–7813. Michael Lindsey, Petitioner v. Indiana. On petition for
writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Indiana, Fourth District.
Motion of petitioner for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and peti­
tion for writ of certiorari granted. Judgment vacated, and case re­
manded to the Court of Appeals of Indiana, Fourth District for further
consideration in light of the position asserted by Indiana in its brief
for the respondent ﬁled on May 23, 2016. The Chief Justice, Justice
Thomas, and Justice Alito dissent for the reasons stated in Nunez v.
United States, 554 U. S. 911, 912 (2008) (Scalia, J., dissenting).
   No. 15–7902. Carlton Brooks, Petitioner v. Louisiana. On petition for
writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeal of Louisiana, Second Circuit.
Motion of petitioner for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and peti­
tion for writ of certiorari granted. Judgment vacated, and case re­
manded to the Court of Appeal of Louisiana, Second Circuit for further
consideration in light of Montgomery v. Louisiana, 577 U. S. –––
(2016). Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Alito joins, concurring in
the decision to grant, vacate, and remand in this case: In granting this
petition and now vacating and remanding the judgment below, the
Court has not assessed whether petitioner’s asserted entitlement to
retroactive relief "is properly presented in the case." Montgomery v.
Louisiana, 577 U. S. ––– (2016) (slip op., at 13). On remand, courts
should understand that the Court’s disposition of this petition does not
2                        MONDAY, OCTOBER 3, 2016

reﬂect any view regarding petitioner’s entitlement to relief. The
Court’s disposition does not, for example, address whether an adequate
and independent state ground bars relief, whether petitioner forfeited
or waived any entitlement to relief (by, for example, entering into a
plea agreement waiving any entitlement to relief), or whether petition­
er’s sentence actually qualiﬁes as a mandatory life without parole
sentence.
  No. 15–9501. Donald Boman, Petitioner v. United States. On petition

   No. 16–602 (16A451). Thomas D. Arthur, Applicant v. Jefferson S.
Dunn, Commissioner, Alabama Department of Corrections, et al. Appli­
cation for stay of execution of sentence of death presented to Justice
Thomas and by him referred to the Court granted pending the disposi­
tion of the petition for writ of certiorari. Should the petition for writ
of certiorari be denied, this stay shall terminate automatically. In the
event the petition for writ of certiorari is granted, the stay shall termi­
nate upon the sending down of the judgment of this Court.
   Statement of The Chief Justice, respecting the grant of the applica­
tion for stay.
   I do not believe that this application meets our ordinary criteria for
a stay. This case does not merit the Court’s review: the claims set
out in the application are purely fact-speciﬁc, dependent on contested
interpretations of state law, insulated from our review by alternative
holdings below, or some combination of the three. Four Justices have,
however, voted to grant a stay. To afford them the opportunity to more
fully consider the suitability of this case for review, including these
circumstances, I vote to grant the stay as a courtesy.
   Justice Thomas and Justice Alito would deny the application.

                         Certiorari Granted
  No. 16–149. Coventry Health Care of Missouri, Inc., fka Group
Health Plan, Inc., Petitioner v. Jodie Nevils. Petition for writ of certio­
rari to the Supreme Court of Missouri granted.


   The Chief Justice said:
   “The Court is in Special Session this afternoon to receive the resolu­
tions of the Bar of the Supreme Court in tribute to Associate Justice
Antonin Scalia. The Court recognizes the Acting Solicitor General of
the United States.”
   The Acting Solicitor General said:
   “Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
   At a meeting today of the Bar of this Court, resolutions memorializ­
ing our deep respect and affection for Justice Scalia were adopted
unanimously.
   “Today, the Bar of this Court convenes to pay respect to a towering
ﬁgure in American law, a Justice of conviction, character, and courage,
a treasured colleague, an irreplaceable mentor, and a man devoted to
his country, its Constitution, and this Court.
   “In his nearly 30-year tenure on this Court, Antonin Scalia displayed
a forceful intellect, a remarkable wit, and an inimitable writing style.
His ideas helped to shape the way we think about law. And for those
blessed to know him, his compassion, humanity, and commitment to his
family, friends, and faith will remain an inspiration.
   “Antonin Scalia was born on March 11th, 1936, in Trenton, New Jer­
sey, and grew up in the Elmhurst neighborhood of Queens. After grad­
uating from Xavier High School in Manhattan and Georgetown Univer­
sity, Justice Scalia attended Harvard Law School. Although he relished
the academic environment at Harvard, the signal event of his Harvard
years occurred outside the classroom, when he met Maureen McCarthy.
Their 55-year marriage produced nine children and dozens of
grandchildren.
226                     FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 2016

  “Following a stint in private practice, Justice Scalia accepted a post
at the University of Virginia School of Law in 1967, and then held a
series of government positions that culminated in his serving as Assist­
ant Attorney General for the Ofﬁce of Legal Counsel in the Depart­
ment of Justice.
  “In 1977, Justice Scalia returned to academia, joining the University
of Chicago faculty. In 1982, President Reagan nominated him to the
U. S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. And then,
in 1986, President Reagan nominated Justice Scalia to this Court.
  “Over the next three decades, Justice Scalia left his mark on the
law in numerous ways, too many to recount in full here. His steadfast
commitment to the idea that external legal principles, rather than in­
ternal policy preference, should govern judicial decision making made
him deeply respectful of the Constitution’s allocation of powers and
vigilant in respecting legal texts.
  “That commitment showed up ﬁrst and most often in his views on
statutory interpretation. Justice Scalia pressed the proposition that,
when interpreting a statutory text, judges must try to discern and
enforce the meanings of words enacted by Congress to express its
policies.
   “In his view, courts should never rewrite a discernible statutory text
to conform it to a law’s unenacted legislative purposes. This new textu­
alism had an undeniable impact on the way the Court does business.
   “Just as Justice Scalia believed that courts should do their best to
honor a statute’s text, he thought the same should be true for the
Constitution. As he saw it, the words of the Constitution bear the same
meaning today as they did when adopted, neither diminished, nor aug­
mented. He thus voted against recognition of new rights that he be­
lieved lacked a foundation in the Constitutional’s—Constitution’s origi­
nal meaning, resisting limitations on Democratic self-government that
he believed the people did not vote to impose. At the same time, he
insisted on unyielding enforcement of those restrictions that he be­
lieved the people did vote to impose in the text of the Constitution.
  “By the end of Justice Scalia’s tenure, a focus on the original public
meaning of the Constitution’s text had become, if not orthodoxy, a thor­
oughly respectable and commonplace approach to constitutional inter­
pretation. His approach was perhaps best illustrated in two particu­
larly noteworthy opinions: District of Columbia v. Heller, holding that
the Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear
                         FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 2016                    227
arms for self-defense, and Crawford v. Washington, interpreting the
Sixth Amendment’s Confrontation Clause.
  “Although Justice Scalia may be best known for his views on statu­
tory and constitutional interpretation, his ﬁrst love was an area of sub­
stantive law, constitutional structure, which shaped his answers to the
underlying questions that appear in every case, who decides, and how.
   “Throughout his tenure, Justice Scalia sought to honor the Constitu­
tion’s structure, its distinct horizontal and vertical lines of power. He
appreciated that men and women were not angels, and that electing or
appointing them to government posts did not make it otherwise.
   “Justice Scalia believed that by assigning three distinct kinds of gov­
ernment power to three distinct branches of government, the Constitu­
tion prevented the concentration of government power in the same
hands.
   “Justice Scalia likewise regarded the Constitution’s vertical separa­
tion of power, Federalism, as a core feature of the Constitution’s struc­
ture that needed to be preserved. He joined the Court’s decisions, rec­
ognizing limits on Congress’s power to regulate interstate commerce,
and upholding the State’s sovereign immunity from suit. In these areas,
as in so many others, Justice Scalia had a—profound effect on the
Court’s jurisprudence.
   “Of course, no account of Justice Scalia’s contribution to this Court
would be complete without mentioning his remarkably clear and vivid
writing, and the inventive, memorable images sprinkled throughout.
The images were memorable precisely because they captured the sub­
stance of the legal point the Justice was making. Surely there was a
separation of powers problem with the creation of what he called a sort
of junior varsity Congress. And surely, there was a deep ﬂaw in a
dormant Commerce Clause test that asked judges to divine, as he put
it, whether a particular line is longer than a particular rock is heavy.
   “And while Justice Scalia’s writing frequently left—leapt off the
page, advocates before the Court often confronted his tenacity and his
wit long before he unsheathed his pen. He peppered lawyers with ques­
tions, sometimes posing 30 or 40 in a single argument. And if he found
an answer unsatisfactory, he pursued the point through short, often
ﬂinty-minded, follow-up inquiries.
   “Throughout his judicial career, Justice Scalia maintained his collec­
tion—connection with the law schools by accepting countless invita­
tions to speak with students and professors.
228                      FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 2016

   “And, in one sense, he never really left teaching. His classroom just
got bigger. He often thought of the audience of his opinions as today’s
and tomorrow’s law students, and he relished opportunities to talk to
students about his theories of judging and about the many useful ways
to use a law degree.
   “Justice Scalia’s productivity and many contributions to the law
could leave one with the misimpression that he left little time for any­
thing else. And, of course, that was not so. This son of Trenton and
Queens became an avid hunter and ﬁsherman. He relished meals with
friends and colleagues and law clerks, often at the much-beloved A.V.’s,
and usually with an anchovy pizza and an occasional glass of red wine.
   “He was an ever-present mentor to his many law clerks. And, of
course, he was deeply devoted to his large and remarkably close family.
   “And through it all, the Justice did everything in his brim-ﬁlled—
brim-ﬁlled life with unstinting vigor, curiosity, engagement, and a
twinkle in his eye.
   “Gathered here together, looking back at his life, the members of the
Bar of the Supreme Court express our deepest respect for the late
Justice Antonin Scalia, our loss at his passing from this life, and our
enduring gratitude for the example he set in his life, both within and
beyond the law.
   “On behalf of the Bar of the Supreme Court, it is my privilege to
present the Court the resolutions adopted today, so that the Attorney
General may move their inscription on the Court’s permanent record.”
   The Chief Justice said:
   “Thank you, General Gershengorn. The Court recognizes the Attor­
ney General of the United States.”
   Ms. Lynch said:
   “Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
   “The Bar of the Court met today to honor the memory of Antonin
G. Scalia, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court from 1986 to 2016.
   “The passing of Justice Scalia has left an enormous void in this court­
room and in the life of the law throughout the United States. With his
razor-sharp brilliance and unmatched eloquence, Justice Scalia trans­
formed the way the jurists and lawyers approach the law. He strode
like a colossus through some of the most important opinions, concur­
rences, and dissents of our time, and he had a singular presence both
in the courtroom and on the page.
   “His penetrating questions at oral argument did not merely seek to
clarify minor nuances; they cut to the heart of a position’s ﬂaws. And
                        FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 2016                    229
his writing did not merely state the law, it captivated all who treasure
memorable and radiant prose.
  “And even those who disagreed with Justice Scalia could appreciate
his inspired wordsmithing, like his assertion that Congress does not
hide elephants in mouseholes or his contention that the rule of law
requires a law of rules.
  “Justice Scalia’s life was a quintessentially American story. His fa­
ther was a Sicilian immigrant who came through Ellis Island as a teen­
ager, earned a doctorate from Columbia, and became a professor. His
mother was an elementary schoolteacher, herself the daughter of Ital­
ian immigrants.
  “By all accounts, Justice Scalia’s talent was obvious from a young
age: From Xavier High School in Manhattan to Georgetown, where he
graduated ﬁrst in his class, to Harvard Law School, where he edited
the Harvard Law Review. He was a charismatic student who loved to
debate. That charisma and his love of the clash of ideas would come to
deﬁne him.
   “With these gifts, he could have gone anywhere and done anything.
He could have conquered the worlds of commerce or found a home
within the business of the law. But rather than pursue material wealth
in the private sector, he chose the wealth of ideas to be found in acade­
mia. And instead of seeking public acclaim, he turned to public service.
   “Law students at the University of Virginia, as well as the Univer­
sity of Chicago, Georgetown, and Stanford, beneﬁted from his rigorous
intellectualism and love of the law. And we at the Department of Jus­
tice also beneﬁted from his dedication to public service.
  “From 1974 to 1977, he served as the head of the Ofﬁce of Legal
Counsel at the Department of Justice. The traits that would come to
deﬁne Justice Scalia’s judicial presence were apparent in that role as
he provided written opinions that showcased his intellectual rigor, his
sharp pen, and his independent mind.
  “He was also known for his ﬁerce support of the independence of the
Ofﬁce of Legal Counsel and of the Department, traditions we are proud
to uphold.
  “Justice Scalia’s contributions to the Supreme Court cannot be over­
stated. Countless pages have been written about the textualist ap­
proach to statutory interpretation he championed. In his three decades
on the bench, he succeeded in changing the very way that lawyers
and judges determine the meaning of congressional enactments, and
230                     FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 2016

he fundamentally transformed legal argument. As Justice Kagan noted
in her Scalia lecture at Harvard Law School, we’re all textualists now.
   “Justice Scalia will also be remembered for his robust interpreta­
tions of the protections that the Constitution affords those who come
in contact with the criminal justice system. His Fourth Amendment
and Sixth Amendment decisions regarding searches, the right to a jury
trial, and the Confrontation Clause fundamentally shaped the way law
enforcement ofﬁcers investigate potential wrongdoing, and the way
prosecutors put on their cases.
   “The opinions are noteworthy for their reliance on Justice Scalia’s
originalist approach to interpreting the Constitution, a philosophy that
looks backwards in order to look forward. It looks back to the founding
of this great nation in an effort to understand the protections reserved
in the Constitution, and it looks forward to demand that we uphold
these protections despite changing times.
  “But Justice Scalia’s greatest legacy may be that he brought un­
matched conviction and enthusiasm to his jurisprudence. In doing so,
he elevated our national legal discourse for all Americans. He chal­
lenged even those who agreed with him, and he earned the respect of
those who did not.
  “Lawyers who appeared before Justice Scalia found themselves com­
pelled to clarify their positions and to sharpen their arguments. Read­
ers of Justice Scalia’s opinions could not disregard the strength of his
reasoning and were forced to re-examine their own convictions.
  “Justice Scalia knew that this was the point of debate, and he also
knew that debate was the essence of democracy. For decades, he had an
outsized role in the debates over the meaning of our most fundamental
principles: principles of liberty, justice, and equality. And because of
the brilliance, the eloquence, and the unique passion he brought to that
debate, he guaranteed that he will continue to shape it for decades
to come.
  “Mr. Chief Justice, on behalf of the lawyers of this nation, and in
particular, the members of this Court’s Bar, I respectfully request that
the resolutions presented to you in honor of Antonin Scalia be accepted
by the Court and that they, together with the chronicle of these pro­
ceedings, be ordered kept for all time in the records of this Court.”
  The Chief Justice said:
  “Thank you, General Lynch. Your request that the Bar resolutions
be made part of the permanent record of the Court is granted.
                        FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 2016                   231
  “The Court extends to the members of the Resolutions Committee,
to the members of the Arrangements Committee, and to the Chairman
of today’s meeting of the Bar our appreciation for the resolutions
adopted today.
  “Antonin Scalia was nominated to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the
D. C. Circuit by President Reagan on July 15th, 1982. He joined that
court on August 17 that same year. And just four years later, President
Reagan nominated him to be our 103rd Supreme Court Justice.
  “At the time of the White House announcement, he was not well-
known to the public. The press had to ask Justice Scalia how to pro­
nounce both his ﬁrst and last names.
   “Antonin Scalia was conﬁrmed on Constitution Day in 1986 by a vote
of 98-0. He took the oath of ofﬁce as an Associate Justice of this Court
on September 26th, 1986. Today, every lawyer and journalist in this
country, and most other citizens as well know how to pronounce Justice
Antonin Scalia.
  “In nearly three decades on this Court, Justice Scalia wrote, by our
count, 282 opinions for the Court, beginning with O’Connor v. United
States, which he announced exactly 30 years ago today, and ending
with Kansas v. Carr, which he announced on January 20 of this year.
  “He was also known to write separately from time to time—author­
ing more than 300 concurrences and nearly as many dissents. He served
with 17 other Justices during his long tenure on this Court.
   “You have already heard of Justice Scalia’s extraordinary legacy. On
matters of constitutional interpretation, he championed the judicial
philosophy of originalism, a view that the Constitution means today
what it meant when it was adopted. He espoused this approach in opin­
ions, both for the Court and in dissent, that are now a central feature
of every law school’s constitutional curriculum.
  “His opinions explaining our Constitution’s structural constraints on
governmental power are among the most important intellectual contri­
butions to the study of liberty since The Federalist Papers.
   “Justice Scalia defended the president’s power to appoint and remove
executive ofﬁcials, not to aggrandize presidential power, but to main­
tain the equilibrium between co-equal branches of government. He in­
sisted that Congress perform the duties within its Constitutional
charge and leave other matters alone, not to manage the legislative
process, but to promote individual freedom through electoral
accountability.
232                      FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 2016

   “He approached the judicial branch with the same rigor. Justice
Scalia demanded that Federal courts stay within their constitutionally
prescribed role of deciding only concrete cases and controversies. He
did so not to avoid difﬁcult issues, but to ensure that judges who are
insulated from the political process resolve only those matters within
Article III’s grant of judicial power.
   “Justice Scalia applied originalist scrutiny to interpreting the Bill of
Rights. His views were especially inﬂuential with respect to the First
Amendment’s religion clauses, the Second Amendment’s right to bear
arms, and the Sixth Amendment’s Confrontation Clause. He persua­
sively explained how the guarantees set forth 225 years ago continue
to provide vital protections in our own age. Writing for the Court in
cases involving the Fourth Amendment, he demonstrated how the cen­
turies-old protections against unreasonable searches and seizures reach
contemporary police investigatory tools, ranging from thermal imaging
to electronic tracking devices to drug-snifﬁng dogs. He once com­
mented that his opinions on the scope of criminal law safeguards in the
Bill of Rights should make him the favorite Justice among criminal
defendants across the country.
   “Now, whether he wrote for the Court or in dissent, Justice Scalia’s
incisive analysis and unforgettable prose compelled jurists, lawyers,
and citizens alike to think deeply about the meaning of the compact
that binds us.
   “Justice Scalia left an equally enduring mark on statutory construc­
tion. His insistence on the primacy of a statute’s text has enforced
greater discipline on the task of construction. As he explained, reliance
on the statutory text restrains judicial discretion and thereby pro­
motes democracy.
   “Although Justice Scalia was a keen legal theorist, he was deeply
concerned about the practical workings of government, and that in­
tense focus is reﬂected in his contributions to administrative law. He
made enduring contributions to that ﬁeld as a teacher, scholar, and
Chairman of the Administrative Conference of the United States, even
before he became a judge.
   “Whatever the discipline, whatever the role, Justice Scalia was com­
mitted to ﬁnding the right answer. And once he had settled upon what
was right, he let the chips fall where they may, and cared not a whit
what others thought about it.
   “Justice Scalia’s voice is perhaps most deeply missed in this very
chamber. From his ﬁrst day on the bench, he was a vigorous participant
                        FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 2016                    233
in oral argument. His insightful inquiries enlivened debate and brought
out the best in his colleagues and the attorneys who appeared before
him, on many occasions also conﬁrming that their best was not good
enough.
   “Now, it would be a stretch to say that there was never a dull mo­
ment in this chamber—but often, just when things were getting a bit
soporiﬁc, counsel would make some assertion that would trigger a reac­
tion from Justice Scalia, ranging from explosive to subtle, and the game
would be on.
   “His comments in this room also included priceless sotto voce in­
sights shared only with those fortunate enough to sit beside him on
the bench.
   “Justice Scalia was not restrained in stating his views clearly and
forcefully, but he never ceased being our dear friend and valued col­
league. He wrestled with ideas, not people, and he knew the difference.
   “He made our days warmer, livelier, and happier. He sang loudest
and best at our traditional birthday celebrations. He raised his glass
highest to toast others’ happy occasions, and his rich laughter ﬁlled our
halls and our hearts.
   “Justice Scalia’s life reached far beyond the law. He would never
have said that the law was what was most important to him. He was
steadfast in his Roman Catholic faith, and he was devoted beyond
measure to his beloved wife, Maureen, and the nine children they
raised.
   “On occasions such as this, speakers often employ so many laudatory
adjectives that the effect can be to sow doubt rather than admiration.
But no one who knew Justice Scalia, however they viewed his work,
would dispute for a moment that he was patriotic, principled, loyal,
courageous, engaging, and brilliant.
   “Those of us on the Court will miss Nino, but we will continue to
feel his presence throughout this building. Our ears will hear his voice
in this courtroom when advocates invoke his words searching for pow­
erful authority. Our minds will move to the measure of his reason in
our chambers when we study his opinions. And our hearts will smile,
even as our eyes glisten, when we walk the halls and recall how happy
we were whenever we saw him rounding the corner.”

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

  Present: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Kennedy, Justice Thomas,
Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, Justice Alito, Justice Sotomayor, and
Justice Kagan.

                      Orders in Pending Cases
   No. 16–7792 (16A841). Rolando Ruiz, Applicant v. Texas. Applica­
tion for stay of execution of sentence of death presented to Justice
Thomas and by him referred to the Court denied.
   Justice Breyer dissents.
   Petitioner Rolando Ruiz has been on death row for 22 years, most of
which he has spent in permanent solitary conﬁnement. Mr. Ruiz argues
that his execution “violates the Eighth Amendment” because it “fol­
low[s] lengthy [death row] incarceration in traumatic conditions,” prin­
cipally his “permanent solitary conﬁnement.” Petition 25. I believe his
claim is a strong one, and we should consider it.
   This Court long ago, speaking of a period of only four weeks of im­
prisonment prior to execution, said that a prisoner’s uncertainty before
execution is “one of the most horrible feelings to which he can be sub­
jected.” In re Medley, 134 U. S. 160, 172 (1890). Here the prisoner has
undergone death row imprisonment, not of four weeks, but of 22 years.
   Moreover, in 1890, this Court recognized long-standing “serious ob­
jections” to extended solitary conﬁnement. The Court pointed to stud­
ies showing that “[a] considerable number of the prisoners fell, after
even a short conﬁnement, into a semi-fatuous condition, from which it
was next to impossible to arouse them, and others became violently
insane; others still, committed suicide; while those who stood the ordeal
better were not generally reformed, and in most cases did not recover
sufﬁcient mental activity to be of any subsequent service to the commu­
nity. It became evident that some changes must be made in the sys­
tem,” as “its main feature of solitary conﬁnement was found to be too
severe.” Id., at 168.
   Others have more recently pointed out that a terrible “human toll”
is “wrought by extended terms of isolation” and that “[y]ears on end
of near-total isolation exact a terrible” psychiatric “price.” Davis v.
Ayala, 576 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2015) (Kennedy, J., concurring) (quoting
In re Medley, supra, at 170) (slip op., at 2-4). As a result it has been
suggested that, “[i]n a case that present[s] the issue,” this Court should
560                       TUESDAY, MARCH 7, 2017

determine whether extended solitary conﬁnement survives Eighth
Amendment scrutiny. Davis v. Ayala, supra, at ___–___ (opinion of
Kennedy, J.) (slip op., at 3–4). This I believe is an appropriate case to
conduct that constitutional scrutiny.
  Here the “human toll" that accompanies extended solitary conﬁne­
ment is exacerbated by the fact that execution is in the ofﬁng. More­
over, Mr. Ruiz has developed symptoms long associated with solitary
conﬁnement, namely severe anxiety and depression, suicidal thoughts,
hallucinations, disorientation, memory loss, and sleep difﬁculty. Fur­
ther, the lower courts have recognized that Mr. Ruiz has been diligent
in pursuing his claims, ﬁnding the 22-year delay attributable to the
State or the lower courts. Ruiz v. Quarterman, 504 F. 3d 523, 530 (CA5
2007) (quoting Ruiz v. Dretke, 2005 WL 2620193, *2 (WD Tex., Oct. 13,
2005)). Nor are Mr. Ruiz’s 20 years of solitary conﬁnement attributable
to any special penological problem or need. They arise simply from the
fact that he is a prisoner awaiting execution. App. E to Petition 16.
  If extended solitary conﬁnement alone raises serious constitutional
questions, then 20 years of solitary conﬁnement, all the while under
threat of execution, must raise similar questions, and to a rare degree,
and with particular intensity. That is why I would grant a stay of exe­
cution, allowing the Court to examine the record more fully.


   No. 16–8135 (16A858). Rolando Ruiz, Applicant v. Lorie Davis, Di­
rector, Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Correctional Institu­
tions Division. Application for stay of execution of sentence of death
presented to Justice Thomas and by him referred to the Court denied.

  “If the applicants will stand, the clerk will administer the oath, but
before he does so, I would like you to know that you are being admitted
on a very special anniversary. Fifty years ago today, where you are
standing, Justice Ginsburg took the oath of ofﬁce, the same one you are
about to take, along with her husband Martin Ginsburg. So on this
special anniversary, I would like to extend each of you a warm welcome
as a member of the bar of this Court, and an ofﬁcer of the Court.”

                Certiorari—Summary Dispositions
   No. 16–7806. Marcus Deshaw Hicks, Petitioner v. United States. On
petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals
for the Fifth Circuit. Motion of petitioner for leave to proceed in forma
pauperis and petition for writ of certiorari granted. Judgment vacated,
and case remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit for further consideration in light of the position asserted by the
Acting Solicitor General in his brief for the United States ﬁled on May

tice Thomas joins, dissenting.
   No. 16–7835. Toforest Onesha Johnson, Petitioner v. Alabama. On

   The Chief Justice, with whom Justice Thomas, Justice Alito, and Jus­
tice Gorsuch join, dissenting: The Court vacates the judgment below
in light of the position asserted by the respondent in its brief. That
position is that the Court should vacate a state court judgment for
876                       MONDAY, JUNE 26, 2017

further consideration in light of Ex parte Beckworth, 190 So. 3d 571
(Ala. 2013). Beckworth is a state court decision that turns entirely on
state procedural law. It was expressly called to the attention of the
state courts, which declined to upset the decision below in light of it.
Reply to Pet. for Cert. 2, n. 1. The question presented concerns state
collateral review—purely a creature of state law that need not be pro­
vided at all. Whatever one’s view on the propriety of our practice of
vacating judgments based on positions of the parties, see Hicks v.
United States, 582 U. S. ––– (2017), the Court’s decision to vacate this
state court judgment is truly extraordinary. I respectfully dissent.
