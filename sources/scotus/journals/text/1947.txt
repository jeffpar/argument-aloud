The Chief Justice announced the following order of the Court:
No. 376. Miami Transportation Company, Inc., of Indiana, appel-
lant, v. The United States of America and Interstate Commerce Com-
mission. Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the
Southern District of Indiana. Per curiam: The motion to affirm is

The Chief Justice also announced the entry of an order and decree
in No. 12, Original.
No. 12, Original. The United States of America, complainant, v.
The State of California. Order and Decree.
Since our opinion which was announced in this case June 23, 1947,
two stipulations have been filed in this Court, signed by the Attorney
General and Secretary of the Interior of the United States on the one
hand and by the Attorney General of the State of California on the
other hand. In these stipulations the Attorney General and the Sec-
retary of the Interior purport to renounce and disclaim for the United
States Government paramount governmental power over certain par-
ticularly described submerged lands in the California coastal area.
In such stipulations the United States Attorney General and Secre-
tary of the Interior furthermore purport to bind the United States
to agreements which purport to authorize state lessees of California
coastal submerged lands to continue to occupy and exploit those lands,
and which agreements also purport to authorize California under con-
ditions set out to execute leases for other submerged coastal lands.
Robert E. Lee Jordan has filed a petition in this Court praying that
he be permitted to file a motion as amicus curiae or in the alternative
as an intervenor to have the foregoing stipulations and agreements
750009-47-15

MONDAY, OCTOBER 27, 1947
50
set aside and declared null and void on the ground among others that
the Attorney General and the Secretary of the Interior are without
authority to bind the United States by agreements which it is alleged
would if valid alienate and surrender the Government's paramount.
power over the submerged lands concerning which the stipulations are
made.
It is ordered that the petition of Robert E. Lee Jordan to file the
motion here to declare the stipulations null and void be denied, with-
out prejudice to the assertion of any right he may have in a proper
district court.
It is further ordered that the stipulations between the United States
Attorney General and the Secretary of the Interior on the one hand
and the Attorney General of California on the other, which stipula-
tions purport to bind the United States, be stricken as irrelevant to
any issues now before us.
And for the purpose of carrying into effect the conclusions of this
Court as stated in its opinion announced June 23, 1947, it is ORDERED,
ADJUDGED, AND DECREED as follows:
1. The United States of America is now, and has been at all times
pertinent hereto, possessed of paramount rights in, and full dominion
and power over, the lands, minerals, and other things underlying the
Pacific Ocean lying seaward of the ordinary low-water mark on the
coast of California, and outside of the inland waters, extending sea-
ward three nautical miles and bounded on the north and south, respec-
tively, by the northern and southern boundaries of the State of Cali-
fornia. The State of California has no title thereto or property
interest therein.
2. The United States is entitled to the injunctive relief prayed for
in the complaint.
3. Jurisdiction is reserved by this Court to enter such further orders
and to issue such writs as may from time to time be deemed advisable
or necessary to give full force and effect to this decree.
Inasmuch as the stipulations of July 26, 1947, have been stricken,
Mr. Justice Frankfurter desires explicitly to note his understanding
that insofar as the meaning or scope or validity of the stipulations may
give rise to any legal issue, no such issue has been before the Court or
has here been considered.
Mr. Justice Jackson took no part in the consideration or decision
of this case.
The Chief Justice said:
"The other orders of the Court appear upon the list certified by
the Chief Justice and filed with the Clerk and will not be announced
orally."

Court of the State of Oklahoma. Per curiam: On January 14, 1946,
the petitioner, a Negro, concededly qualified to receive the profes-
sional legal education offered by the State, applied for admission to
the School of Law of the University of Oklahoma, the only institu-
tion for legal education supported and maintained by the taxpayers
of the State of Oklahoma. Petitioner's application for admission was
denied, solely because of her color.
Petitioner then made application for a writ of mandamus in the
District Court of Cleveland County, Oklahoma. The writ of man-
damus was refused, and the Supreme Court of the State of Oklahoma
affirmed the judgment of the District Court. Oklahoma, 180
P. 2d 135. We brought the case here for review.
-
The petitioner is entitled to secure legal education afforded by a
state institution. To this time, it has been denied her although
during the same period many white applicants have been afforded
legal education by the State. The State must provide it for her in
conformity with the equal-protection clause of the Fourteenth Amend-
ment and provide it as soon as it does for applicants of any other
group. Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada, 305 U. S. 337 (1938).
The judgment of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma is reversed and
the cause is remanded to that court for proceedings not inconsistent
with this opinion. The mandate shall issue forthwith.
The Chief Justice said :
"The other orders of the Court appear upon the list certified by the
Chief Justice and filed with the Clerk and will not be announced
orally."

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Present: Mr. Chief Justice Vinson, Mr. Justice Black, Mr. Justice
Reed, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, Mr. Justice Douglas, Mr. Justice
Jackson, Mr. Justice Rutledge, and Mr. Justice Burton.
Mr. Solicitor General Perlman addressed the Court as follows:
"May it please this Honorable Court: At a meeting of members
of the bar of the Supreme Court, held on November 12, 1947, resolu-
tions expressing their profound sorrow at the death of Chief Justice
Harlan Fiske Stone were offered by a committee, of which the Hon-
orable Dean Acheson was chairman. Addresses on the resolutions
were made by the Honorable John J. Parker, senior judge of the
Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals; Luther Ely Smith, Esquire, of
St. Louis, Mo., and the Honorable Herbert Wechsler, of New York.
The resolutions, adopted unanimously, are as follows:
66 6 'RESOLUTIONS
""Chief Justice Stone died in Washington, D. C., on April 22, 1946,
while in his twenty-second year of active service as a Justice of the
Supreme Court. The members of the Bar of this Court have met in
the Supreme Court Building on November 12, 1947, to offer affec-
tionate tribute to his memory and to record with due solemnity their
respect for the man and for his distinguished services to his pro-
fession and to his Nation.
"Harlan Fiske Stone was born in Chesterfield, N. H., on October
11, 1872. His youth was spent in Amherst, Mass., where he attended
the public schools. Perhaps in consequence of these early years, he
has always seemed the embodiment of the traditional New England
virtues frugal in habits, careful in his conduct and sturdy in his
judgment. He entered Amherst College as a member of the class of
1894. His undergraduate record was enviable, both as a scholar
and as a leader of his fellows, and he maintained throughout his
life a lively interest in the College, serving as trustee for many years.
Following his graduation he was for one year principal and science
instructor of the Newburyport High School. In September, 1895,
he entered Columbia Law School.
""Columbia soon became one of the absorbing interests of his life.
As a student there he maintained a high scholastic record, notwith-
standing the necessity of earning his expenses by tutoring and by
teaching history at Adelphi Academy. He had abiding love for
750009-48- -66

WEDNESDAY, MARCH 31, 1948
188
teaching, which requires equally the learning of the scholar and the
sympathy and understanding necessary to lead the student. He was
delighted, therefore, about a year after receiving his LL. B. in 1898,
to be appointed a part-time lecturer at Columbia Law School. Dur-
ing the next six years he taught a great variety of subjects and thus
laid the foundation for that intimate familiarity with the law which
was so richly to be reflected in the learning of his judicial opinions
and the solidity of his judgments.
"Concurrently with the satisfaction he achieved as a teacher, he
was winning rapid recognition at the New York Bar. In 1903 he
had become a partner in Wilmer, Canfield and Stone. Two years
later he resigned from the Columbia faculty to devote his time
exclusively to practice as a member of Satterlee, Canfield and Stone.
He found many attractions in private practice. He enjoyed working
out concrete legal problems by reducing complex matters to their
simpler fundamentals. As a practicing lawyer his vast analytical
talents and the wisdom of his counsel could be put to the immediate
practical benefit of the client who asked his help.
"Without relinquishing his work in the law firm, Harlan Stone
returned to Columbia in 1910 to become Dean of the Law School.
He continued active teaching throughout his thirteen years as Dean.
His penetrating writings established him as a leading authority on
the law of equity and trusts. In these fields he found his favorite
paths, since here above all other branches the law showed its magnifi-
cent capacity for flexible adaptation to changing circumstances and
to ends broader than the claims of particular litigants. The law of
equity, in particular, showed with much clarity that the great role of
judge is, as he later put it, to apply "all the resources of the creative
mind to the perpetual problem of attuning the law to the world in
which it is to function."
""Columbia Law School flourished under the wise guidance of
Harlan Stone. He had firm ideas as to the importance of the legal
profession and the high obligation of the law schools to their stu-
dents and through them to society. He lent vigorous support to
reforms in legal education, but was careful that these should not be
made at the sacrifice of a thorough training in the basic groundwork
of the law. He took a lively interest in his students, and won their
life-long affection by his kindness, his unpretentiousness and his in-
variable willingness to lend a helping hand. His impartiality and
common sense were combined with a self-assurance that encouraged
others to draw upon his strength.
"
'During the First World War Harlan Stone served as a member
of a very active Board of Inquiry which disposed of the cases of
drafted men. who had refused on grounds of conscientious objection

189
to perform military service. The problem of the conscientious objec-
tor was far less understood by the country in 1918 than it is today,
and the difficult task called for the highest degree of patience, toler-
ance, and common sense. Shortly after the Board had completed
its assignment, Harlan Stone summarized its work and gave account
of his own views: "However rigorous the state may be in repressing
the commission of acts which are regarded as injurious to the state,
it may well stay its hand before it compels the commission of acts
which violate the conscience." This was the same scrupulous regard
for the rights of conscience which later moved him to write his dis-
senting opinion in the flag-salute case, perhaps the most dramatically
successful dissent in the Court's history.
"'In 1923 he decided once again to devote his full time to private
practice and resigned from Columbia to become a member of Sullivan
and Cromwell. But he was not to remain there long. When changes
became necessary in the Department of Justice, President Coolidge
called upon Harlan Stone, whom he had known since their days at
Amherst, to accept the appointment as Attorney General. His name
was sent to the Senate on April 7, 1924. The remainder of his life was
devoted wholly to the public service. At the Department of Justice
he acquired at first-hand a knowledge and appreciation of the hazards
and the skills involved in the successful management of a large govern-
ment agency.
"Harlan Stone had thus achieved singular eminence as a lawyer,
as a teacher, and as a public servant when President Coolidge, on
January 5, 1925, nominated him to the place on the Supreme Court
left vacant by the retirement of Justice McKenna. The nomination
nevertheless met some opposition in the Senate because of the fear of
some, who did not know the man, that his representation of large
financial interests during his law practice was evidence of bias and
undue conservatism. Those who expressed those fears were glad, in
later years, to admit their lack of foundation. Harlan Stone took his
seat as an Associate Justice on March 2, 1925. He served on the courts
of Taft and Hughes, and on the latter's retirement was nominated
by President Roosevelt to be Chief Justice, taking the oath as Chief
Justice on July 3, 1941. His vigorous, single-minded devotion to the
work of the Court continued until the moment of his death.
""The opinions of Justice Stone number nearly 600, and will be
found from the 268th to the 328th United States. They cover the entire
range of the Court's business and there is no part of it which has not
been shaped by the solid craftsmanship of Harlan Stone. Many
branches of the Supreme Court's work were already familiar to him,
but many were new. His rapid mastery of patent, admiralty, and
public land law, for example, is striking evidence of the adaptability
B
9

WEDNESDAY, MARCH 31, 1948
190
of his learning and skill. Here, as in all of his work, one may see the
impressive results of the combination of a forthright character and a
powerful intellect. He was able to meet issues squarely because he
understood them well.
""The accidents of national and legal history served, however, to
project into sharper focus the work of Justice Stone in the field of
constitutional law. He was peculiarly suited by temperament and by
training to discharge the delicate and awesome responsibilites of the
judge who must measure an act of the legislature against the organic
charter of the nation. His talents and his wisdom were made available
at a time in which they were to prove of especial benefit, for his span
of service was to cover a period more critical in the history of the Court
than any since the outbreak of the Civil War.
66
'When Justice Stone came to the bench there had already de-
veloped within the Court a substantial divergency of views on con-
stitutional issues of high importance to the Nation. Justice Stone
brought to the Court an abiding faith in the power of reason and in
the historic function of the judiciary. He was hopeful that the differ-
ences among his brethren might diminish through the process of de-
liberation and adjudication. During his first decade on the Court,
however, as the constitutional issues pressed more heavily on the Court,
he discovered that the differences were too deeply rooted for such
adjustment. More and more often he found himself. in the company
of Justices Holmes and Brandeis (and later Justice Cardozo), unable
to accept the rigid interpretations and applications of the Constitution
to which the majority of the Court adhered with staunch conviction.
"Justice Stone took as his bench-mark the words of Chief Justice
Marshall, and viewed the Constitution as a broad charter of govern-
ment "intended to endure for ages to come, and. consequently, to be
adapted to the various crises of human affairs." Its provisions, he
has said, were to be read "not with the narrow literalness of a munici-
pal code or a penal statute. but so that its high purposes should
illumine every sentence and phrase of the document and be given
effect as a part of a harmonious framework of government." His
opinions are the solid product of that basic philosophy. His approach
to a constitutional issue was essentially pragmatic, with attentive re-
gard to the lessons of experience, and he was wary of generalizations
not anchored to the circumstances of particular cases. He was always
mindful that judicial interpretations of the Constitution, since they
are beyond the power of the legislature to correct, must in the first
instance be confined to the case at hand, and, in the second, be open
to reconsideration in the light of new experience and greater knowl-
edge and wisdom.
"With the shift in constitutional doctrine which occurred during
the service of Chief Justice Hughes, Justice Stone had the satisfaction

WEDNESDAY, MARCH 31, 1948
191
of seeing one after another of his dissenting opinions in constitutional
cases become the law of the Court. This, in at least substantial part,
was a tribute to his good judgment and sense of proportion and to the
persuasiveness of his opinions. Interstate commerce, taxation, and
the public regulation of business are among the many fields in which
his careful development of constitutional limitations and powers has
provided a firm basis for continuity and progress. He was ever faith-
ful to his conviction that the Constitution had not adopted any par-
ticular set of social and economic ideas, to the exclusion of others
which, however wrong they seemed to him, fair-minded men yet might
hold. He had a full appreciation of the role of the law in making
accommodations between conflicting interests; and he was sensitive to
the unique responsibility which our federal system places upon the
Supreme Court to work out such accommodations between the na-
tional government and the states.
"Along with his broad tolerance for economic development and
experimentation Justice Stone carried a firm belief that the Supreme
Court, together with all other branches of the national and local
governments, must exercise constant vigilance to ensure that the rights
of the person be preserved inviolate. His opinions reflect his vivid
realization of the unceasing responsibility of the courts in helping to
assure that our society remain the self-government of free people
which the Constitution established.
"When he succeeded to the Chief Justiceship, in his sixty-ninth
year, Harlan Stone still had the tremendous vitality and the capacity
for work that had contributed so much to the fruitfulness of his career
as a lawyer, teacher, and judge. The burdens of the office were heavy.
Yet he never slackened his pace, and continued to maintain an exem-
plary record in the prompt dispatch of the Court's business. Some
of his most important opinions were those written for the Court on
novel questions arising out of the Second World War, where he gave
due recognition both to the wartime necessities of the government and
to the principles of civil liberty which must be maintained, in war as in
peace, by a free society.
""Throughout his life Harlan Stone maintained an active interest
in the arts. He found an enormous satisfaction in music, painting,
and sculpture. As Chief Justice he became ex officio Chairman of
the Board of Trustees of the National Gallery of Art and Chancellor
of the Smithsonian Institution; he also served as Chairman of the
Folger Shakespeare Library. To these tasks he brought not only
wisdom but enthusiasm.
""No comment on the career of Harlan Stone can adequately
reflect the esteem in which the Bar held him as a man, nor the depth
of the affection felt for him by all who knew him. He had a funda-
$
1
1

12
WEDNESDAY, MARCH 31, 1948
192
mental contentment which reflected the happy family life he shared
with his wife, Agnes Harvey Stone, and their two sons.
He was
genial in manner, delightful in conversation, and always accessible
to any who came. He was considerate and tolerant of the opinions
of others, though he resisted loose thinking even when it was directed
toward a philanthropic purpose.
"It is accordingly
"Resolved, That we, the Bar of the Supreme Court of the United
States, express our profound sorrow at the death of Chief Justice.
Harlan Fiske Stone and our thankfulness for the enduring contribu-
tions which this great man and wise judge has made to our profession
and to our national life: It is further
66
'Resolved, That the Attorney General be asked to present these
resolutions to the Court, and to request that they be inscribed upon
its permanent records." "
Mr. Attorney General Clark addressed the Court as follows:
"May it please this Honorable Court: We are gathered here today
to pay tribute to the memory of Chief Justice Harlan Fiske Stone,
a man whose life and works exemplified the highest traditions of
our profession. Truly, the law, in actuality, was to this great Ameri-
can and distinguished jurist ‘a human institution for human needs.'
He did much to make it so.
"Born on October 11, 1872, when Ulysses S. Grant was President
of the United States and Salmon P. Chase was Chief Justice presid-
ing over this Court, Harlan Stone rose from the humble surround-
ings of his birthplace at Chesterfield, New Hampshire, to the highest
judicial post in the Nation. Seventy-three years later, on April 22,
1946, he died in the service of his Nation as Chief Justice of the
United States. Those three-score and thirteen years were measured.
by a continuous devotion to the best interests of his fellow man.
"From his birthplace in New Hampshire, young Stone moved early
with his parents to northern Massachusetts, and it was there that he
grew to manhood. His early interest seemed to be farming, and
for a while he attended Massachusetts Agricultural College. It is
reported-authoritatively-that he was asked to depart from that
college for some boisterous pranks. Soon thereafter he entered
Amherst College. The change was a fortuitous one-at least insofar
as the law has become the beneficiary of his talents. After complet-
ing his studies at Amherst, he enrolled at the School of Law of
Columbia University. In 1898 he was awarded the degree of Bache-
lor of Laws, with very high honors, notwithstanding that throughout
his law studies he supported himself by teaching and by tutoring.
For him, characteristically, it was no more than normal routine to
1
作

WEDNESDAY, MARCH 31, 1948
193
carry responsibilities that would ordinarily require the full time
of two men.
"He stayed on to teach at the law school. The maturing influence of
study in a great diversity of legal subjects marked this important
period of his life. For five years subsequent to 1905, he gave up teach-
ing and occupied himself entirely in private practice in New York
City. He returned on the call to become Dean of the Columbia Uni-
versity Law School. There he became recognized as one of the great
legal educators of his day.
"He left the Deanship on the call of the President of the United
States to enter Government Service as the Attorney General of the
United States. In the next year, on March 2, 1925, President Coolidge
elevated him to Associate Justice of this Court, succeeding to the
vacancy left by the retirement of Mr. Justice Joseph McKenna. To
this post he brought a wealth of knowledge both in the law and in the
affairs of man.
"On June 12, 1941, on the retirement of Chief Justice Charles Evans
Hughes, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed him Chief Justice
of the United States-an appointment which was received with uni-
versal acclaim. And foremost among those who praised his elevation
was the late Senator Norris who had opposed his nomination in 1925
as Associate Justice. 'In the years that have passed I became con-
vinced, and am now convinced, that in my opposition to the confirma-
tion of his nomination I was entirely in error,' the late Senator
confessed in a speech on the floor of the Senate, and added, 'I am now
about to perform one of the most pleasant duties that has ever come
to me in my official life when I cast a vote in favor of his elevation to
the highest judicial office in our land.'
"Harlan Stone had served as Associate Justice for sixteen years, and
was to serve as Chief Justice for five more; these twenty-one eventful
years of service on this bench covered fully one-eighth of the history
of the Court itself. He met the many problems brought to the Court
with a judicial tact and fairness that won him universal acclaim as one
of the outstanding champions of the dignity of man. This Court was
faced again and again with the task of redefining the power of the
Government in its relation to persons and property. Crisis after crisis
was met giving this nation the necessary strength to surmount economic
chaos and to defeat the armed might of totalitarianism. And all this
while fully preserving and enlarging the individual liberties of our
people. Harlan Stone played a leading part in the development of this
continuous growth of the law. He would have felt, and we know he
did feel, that his effort was only a part of that of a team. He per-
formed his job as did every other good American citizen.
"This common touch, this feeling of friendship and brotherhood
with every human being, regardless of his station in life, was perhaps
IN
IN
14
F

WEDNESDAY, MARCH 31, 1948
194
the most noteworthy facet of the character of the late Chief Justice.
His ability was indeed superb and outstanding, but it was by no means
overweening; his character was in truth righteous and determined,
but it was not domineering. His was an outlook fundamentally
healthy, for throughout his life he had maintained himself in trim-
physically, mentally, and spiritually. He was a man who encompassed
a wide and diversified field of interests and who was capable of mas-
tering and appreciating each one. Though partisan of all that he
considered right and good, yet when he sat in judgment he held him-
self strictly to a lofty concept of the nature of the judicial function.
A judge by the nature of his calling must needs be thus impartial, but
the wellnigh perfect detachment of Harlan Stone may serve as a
model to all who may follow him.
"I shall not attempt a full evaluation of the contribution made by
Harlan Fiske Stone to the law, nor can I here do adequate justice to
his character or personality. Such an effort, indeed, would be as
injudicious here as it would be impossible of attainment, for the
progress which the law has made through his efforts is immeasurable
in its vast extent. It touches the full field of legal development. The
six hundred opinions of which he was the author are milestones along
the pathway of legal advancement. With outstanding independence
of thought, they have enriched the product of a court always justly
renowned for its independence.
"Basically, I think one may say that the feeling that moved him
most in his judicial life was one of humility, accompanied by a clear
understanding of what he conceived his task to be and a faith in his
ability to accomplish it. The law to him was not an absolute; he was
not one of those who felt that the work of a Judge consisted, like
that of a tailor, simply in taking the measure of legislative enact-
ment to constitutional provision and determining whether the size
of the one was too large to fit the other. On the contrary, the law
had a direct relationship to changing economic and social needs.
It was not a rigid bar or strait-jacket to bind the limbs of man in his
development; its function was to assist and not to hinder man's
progress.
"He did not feel that it was the function of a Judge or of the
Court, as he put it, 'to sit as a superlegislature, or as triers of the
facts on which a legislature is to say what shall or shall not be done.
In dealing, for example, with the complicated question of what in-
strumentalities of state or federal government might be taxed by
the other, he insisted that 'the limitation upon the taxing power of
each, so far as it affects the other, must receive a practical construc-
tion which permits both to function with the minimum of inter-
ference each with the other.'

"His own approach to the judicial function in construing the
validity of legislation was stated simply: 'Some presumption should
be indulged that the [state] legislature had an adequate knowledge
* local conditions * *
of
* On this deserved respect
for the judgment of the local lawmaker depends, of course, the pre-
sumption in favor of constitutionality, for the validity of a regula-
tion turns "upon the existence of conditions, peculiar to the business
under consideration."
Moreover, we should not, when the
matter is not clear, oppose our notion of the seriousness of the
problem or the necessity of the legislation to that of local tribunals.
* *. But even if the presumption is not to be indulged, and the
burden no longer to be cast on him who attacks the constitutionality
of a law, we need not close our eyes to available data throwing light
on the problem with which the legislature had to deal.'
*
* *

"Often, indeed, during his incumbency on this Bench, it must
have given him satisfaction to see that the passing years had proved
his point, that many of his dissenting opinions had come to express
the law in the eyes of the majority of the Court. But his feeling
was not merely pride because views which he had stated contrary
to the majority had finally been proclaimed to be right; it was rather
a sense of gratification that the Court had functioned in accordance
with what he considered to be a judiciousness necessary and appro-
priate to it.
"His last words from this Bench were, as we all know, fully charac-
teristic of his judicial philosophy. Fifteen years earlier, the Court had
decided that admission to citizenship had to be denied an alien who
because of religious scruples was unwilling to bear arms in this coun-
try's defense. He had dissented from this view, for he felt that the
alien's willingness to take the oath of allegiance and to serve the
nation as a noncombatant was sufficient to satisfy the statutory re-
quirements for naturalization. The cases were much discussed, and
legislation effecting Stone's views of the matter was several times
proposed in the Congress, but was never enacted. Finally, in 1940 and
1942, new statutes on naturalization were passed, but they retained
unchanged the language which had been earlier construed by the
Court. Stone felt that this amounted to an acceptance by Congress
of the Court's previous interpretation, and for him in this field that
determination was conclusive. When, in 1946, the question was once
more presented to the Supreme Court, although the views of the
majority had come to accord with those which Stone had held in his
earlier dissent, he felt his former position no longer tenable. In his
dissent he said:
"With three other Justices of the Court I dissented in the Macintosh
and Bland cases, for reasons which the Court now adopts as ground
750009-48- -67

WEDNESDAY, MARCH 31, 1948
196
for overruling them. Since the Court in three considered earlier
opinions has rejected the construction of the statute for which the
dissenting Justices contended, the question, which for me is decisive of
the present case, is whether Congress has likewise rejected that con-
struction by its subsequent legislative action, and has adopted and
confirmed the Court's earlier construction of the statutes in question.
A study of Congressional action taken with respect to proposals for
amendment of the naturalization laws since the decision in the Schwim-
mer case, leads me to conclude that Congress has adopted and con-
firmed this Court's earlier construction of the naturalization laws.
For that reason alone I think that the judgment should be affirmed.'
"This was his last pronouncement as Chief Justice of the United
States. It was dramatically characteristic that this last act was con-
sistent with all the others of his life, that he died as he had lived-
courageously and honestly, with the dignity and humility of a man
who is at peace with himself and whose philosophy embraces all men
in the scheme of government and of life.
"Words are inadequate in my effort to express the high esteem and
affection in which the late Chief Justice was held as a man, and the
very real respect with which his accomplishments as a Judge and his
contribution to justice and law must be regarded. The courts, he felt,
'are concerned only with the power to enact statutes, and not with their
wisdom' and, 'while unconstitutional exercise of power by the execu-
tive and legislative branches of the Government is subject to judicial
restraint, we should remember that the only check upon our exercise
of power is our own sense of self-restraint.' His abiding faith in the
people was expressed in his statement that 'For the removal of unwise
laws from the statute books appeal lies not to the courts but to the
ballot and to the processes of democratic government.'
"Mr. Chief Justice of the United States and Associate Justices of
this Court: In the name of the lawyers of this nation, and particularly
of the Bar of this Court, I respectfully request that the resolution pre-
sented to you this morning memorializing the life of the late Chief
Justice Harlan Fiske Stone be accepted by you, and that it, together
with the chronicle of these proceedings, be ordered to be kept for all
time to come in the records of this Court."
The Chief Justice said:
"Mr. Attorney General: The Court receives with deep gratification
the Resolutions expressing tribute to the memory and service of the
late Chief Justice. He was taken from us in the active performance
of duty. No tribute would have been more highly prized by him than
this tribute from the Bar of this Court, which he loved and served so
well.

"The task of accurately epitomizing, in a few short paragraphs, the
life and character of any man is always a difficult one. Human per-
sonality is a too richly varied and subtle thing to be captured within
the confines of a formula. But in dealing with the career of Harlan
Fiske Stone, the magnitude of the task is immeasurably enhanced. For
few men have possessed the versatility of the late Chief Justice. Not
only did he become one of the great figures in the history of this Court,
but his distinguished career included service as a practicing attorney,
educator, scholar, and statesman. Nor were his energies and talents
confined to his professional activities. His intellectual interests were
many and varied; and he was well versed in the arts of friendship.
"Harlan Fiske Stone was born at Chesterfield, New Hampshire, in
the year 1872. Shortly after his birth, his parents moved to northern
Massachusetts; and there he grew to maturity. The childhood of
Harlan Fiske Stone was that of a typical New England farm boy. It
was at times a rigorous and demanding life, but it was also a life full
of satisfactions and one well calculated to develop independence and
self-sufficiency.
"After a period of attendance at the Massachusetts Agricultural
College, he entered Amherst College in the class of 1894. The wide
breadth of his interests and talents was apparent even at this early
period. While at Amherst, he made an enviable academic record and
was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. But he was also a campus leader,
being three times elected president of his class, and, during his junior
and senior years, was a star member of the varsity football team.
"In 1895, Harlan Stone entered the Columbia Law School, an insti-
tution to which he was to dedicate much of his interests and talents in
years to come. He graduated with high honors in 1898, despite the
fact that during the period he was required to support himself by
such outside activities as teaching and tutoring.
"From the time he received his law degree until he entered the serv-
ice of the government, some twenty-six years later, Harlan Stone
engaged in the active private practice of the law either on a part-time
or on a full-time basis. For the six years following his graduation he
supplemented his activities as a private practitioner by serving as an
instructor at the Columbia Law School. In 1910 he returned to the
Law School as Dean, a position which he retained until 1923. The
thirteen years in which he served as Dean were years of great con-
structive development for the Law School. It was also during this
period that he established his reputation as an outstanding legal
scholar. His work in the law of equity and related subjects remains,
even with the passage of the years, the definitive scholarship in those
fields.
"Following the termination of his academic duties, Harlan Stone
engaged in the full-time practice of law in New York City. In April,

WEDNESDAY, MARCH 31, 1948
198
1924, he was appointed Attorney General in the cabinet of his former
classmate, President Calvin Coolidge. On January 5, 1925, he was
nominated Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United
States.
"The appointment of Harlan Stone to the Court was viewed with
misgivings in some quarters. Because of the nature of his law prac-
tice, he was suspected by some of possessing the point of view of the
large financial interests of the nation to the exclusion of all others.
Some criticized his participation in the case of Owenbey v. Morgan,
256 U. S. 94 (1921). In that case he had successfully argued in this
Court in defense of the constitutionality of a Delaware rule of pro-
cedure, relating to attachment cases involving nonresident defendants,
which conditioned the defendant's right to appear and contest the
merits of the plaintiff's demand upon the defendant's first giving
special security, even where the defendant was unable to furnish such
security. On March 6, 1925, the Senate confirmed his nomination,
however, with only six votes cast in opposition.
"After sixteen years of distinguished service on this Court, he was
appointed Chief Justice by President Franklin Roosevelt. The ap-
pointment was universally acclaimed; and the Senate confirmed the
nomination without a dissenting voice being raised. Of the six mem-
bers who had opposed his confirmation in 1925, two remained in the
Senate in 1941 when his nomination as Chief Justice was presented.
One of these was Senator George Norris, who stated: 'In the years
that have passed I became convinced, and am now convinced, that in
my opposition to the confirmation of his nomination I was entirely
in error.'
"Harlan Stone served on this Court for twenty-one years-sixteen
years as an Associate Justice and five years as Chief Justice. He
served during one of the most significant periods in the history of
this Court. It was a period of great social readjustment in the nation
as a whole. Movement and change were the order of the day. The
trend toward a new social equilibrium was felt in every aspect of the
nation's life. Inevitably, the impact of the times was felt on this
Court. No man played a more vital role in the development of the
law during this crucial period than Harlan Stone. Some slight under-
standing of the importance of the part he played may be gained by
observing that in the entire history of this Court probably no other
member lived to see so many views expressed in dissent subsequently
accepted by the majority of the Court as the law of the land.
"To Harlan Stone, the great hazard to the perpetuation of con-
stitutional government was narrow and illiberal construction of con-
stitutional provisions. As a corollary to that basic proposition, he
believed a judge, confronted with constitutional issues, to be under
A
E

WEDNESDAY, MARCH 31, 1948
199
the continuing obligation of guarding against the tendency to confuse
his own personal feelings as to the wisdom and expediency of legisla-
tion with the question of the constitutionality of that legislation.
Self-restraint in the exercise of judicial power was to him an essential
prerequisite to the successful functioning of our system of government.
"But although insisting that the exercise of judicial power be con-
fined to its proper sphere, he did not hesitate to exert that power fully
in cases where it appeared to him that basic safeguards of the funda-
mental charter had been overstepped. Most frequently, those were
cases involving contentions that civil liberties had been denied; and
in those opinions some of his most eloquent writing appears. He gave
much thought to the problem of preserving individual freedom in the
complexities of modern society and under a system of dual sovereignty
which characterizes our form of government. He was well aware that
the problem is not a simple one and is not one which may be solved
by mechanical application of a convenient formula. The 'perpetual
question of constitutional law,' he wrote, is to determine 'where the
line is to be drawn which marks the boundary between the appropriate
field of individual liberty and right and that of government action for
the larger good, so as to insure the least sacrifice of both types of
social advantage.'
"But Harlan Stone's contributions were not confined to the field.
of constitutional law. His written opinions deal with the whole range
of problems which come before this Court; and in considering his
contributions in these diverse fields, one cannot but be impressed
with the scope of his capacities and the influence of his thought.
"As Chief Justice, Harlan Stone displayed the same energy and
conscientious devotion to duty which had characterized his earlier
service on the Court. He presided over the Court in the dark years
of war. Difficult problems arising from the conduct of total war by
a democratic nation frequently were presented for adjudication. The
period was marked, also, by the continuing development of the Con-
ference of the Senior Circuit Judges and other devices contributing
to the improvement of standards of judicial administration in the
federal courts.
"Harlan Stone was a man of warm human qualities. His broad
interests, genial personality, and lack of pretension won for him the
respect and affection of his brethren on the Court and an unusually
wide circle of friends off the bench. At home, he enjoyed the happy
comradeship of his gracious and gifted life's partner and their two
worthy sons. I recall with pleasure my own associations with him.
I will ever cherish the honor of receiving his designation to serve
as Chief Justice of the Emergency Court of Appeals. Our personal
and official relations were marked by his never-failing cordiality and
his high sense of public responsibility.

"While not absorbed by his official duties, he was able to pursue
his deep interest in literature and the arts. His intellectual curiosity
was insatiable. Few men attain so well-rounded a development of
their capacities.
"The high place of Harlan Stone in the history of this Court and
of this nation is well assured. American jurisprudence has been
enriched by his creative touch. His life and character were in com-
plete accord with the finest of democratic traditions."
The Chief Justice directed that the resolutions be spread upon the
minutes of the Court.
Mr. Solicitor General Perlman addressed the Court as follows:
"May it please this Honorable Court:
"At a meeting of members of the bar of the Supreme Court, held
on November 12th, 1947, resolutions expressing their profound sorrow
at the death of Associate Justice James Clark McReynolds were
offered by a committee, of which the Honorable James F. Byrnes,
former Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, was chairman.
Addresses on the resolutions were made by the Honorable John W.
Davis, the Honorable George Wharton Pepper and the Honorable
R. V. Fletcher. The resolutions, adopted unanimously, are as
follows:
“‘RESOLUTIONS
"At a meeting of the Bar of the Supreme Court of the United
States held on November 12, 1947, to take appropriate action in
memory of the late Mr. Justice McReynolds, the Committee
appointed by the Solicitor General reported this Minute for sub-
mission and action:
"Although he was a native of Kentucky, the career of James
Clark McReynolds was more closely identified with the State of
Tennessee, where he received his academic training and first prac-
ticed law. For many years he was the only representative of the
South on the Supreme Court of the United States. Preeminently he
represented the philosophy which has come to be known as that
of the constitutional Democrat. He characterized his own ideas as
those "of an old-time Cleveland Democrat" and "of a gold
Democrat."
""He was the supreme type of the rugged individualist. Rugged-
ness was his outstanding characteristic. He was a large, six-foot
frame of a man, with erect, military bearing and the aspect of an
early Roman senator. He had a face of great strength, which might

have seemed carved from Tennessee granite, but for the illumination
of steel-blue eyes and a suddenly flashing smile. It was a face which
could express every shade of feeling, from genuine graciousness and
generosity of spirit, through flashing wit and humor, to the most
satiric scorn.
"As an individualist he believed in the individual and his rights.
He believed also in the reserved powers of the States. He resented
and resisted the growing exercise of power by the Federal Govern-
ment in fields formerly conceived to have been reserved to the States.
He was a strict constructionist, who felt an impelling conviction that
the Federal Government ought to be held within the framework of
its field of action as delegated to it by the people in the written
Constitution and who resisted what he felt to be a tendency to amend
the Constitution and to expand Federal power by judicial interpre-
tation. And yet, likewise as an individualist, he was strongly opposed
to monopoly and was a vigorous supporter of the antitrust laws.
"He served over a quarter of a century on the Supreme Court:
through World War I, through the following great depression,
through the era of the vast expansion of Federal power, through the
dramatic and historic attack by the Executive on the judiciary, and
through a period in which, ironically enough, he succeeded Louis
Dembitz Brandeis as "the Great Dissenter." He held on with grim
determination after the times had turned against his views and re-
tired just two days before his seventy-ninth birthday. He presents
the paradox of having come to the Court as a much-vaunted, anti-
trust liberal and of having left it as the most die-hard representative.
of the conservative wing. Yet a careful study of his opinions through-
out the quarter-century will disclose a pattern of inflexible and un-
yielding consistency. It was not James Clark McReynolds who
changed. It was the times, the country, the prevailing constitutional
views and the Supreme Court that changed. Justice McReynolds
remained standing in his place, like a granite mountain.
•
""Two illustrations will suffice to show this immovability. They
are both in the field of his opposition to what he deemed to be en-
croachments of the Federal Government upon the reserved powers of
the States.
""One of his most famous dissents was a short one of three para-
graphs in the Oregon-Washington Railway and Navigation Company
case, in 1926. The Court, in an opinion by Chief Justice Taft, held
that an act of Congress covered the whole field of plant disease con-
trol, so far as its spread by interstate transportation could be affected
and restrained, and that consequently a statute of the State of Wash-
ington attempting quarantine against the interstate importation of
alfalfa weevil was invalid. Justice McReynolds delivered a char-
1
地

WEDNESDAY, MARCH 31, 1948
202
acteristically vigorous dissent, joined in by Justice Sutherland, in
which he took the position that the act of Congress did not by its
own terms conflict with the State statute, that the Secretary of Agri-
culture had taken no action under the powers delegated to him by
Congress which conflicted with the State statute, and in which he
concluded: "It is a serious thing to paralyze the efforts of a State
to protect her people against impending calamity, and leave them to
the slow charity of a far-off and perhaps supine Federal bureau. No
such purpose should be attributed to Congress unless indicated beyond
reasonable doubt." Congress promptly amended the Federal act in-
terpreted in that case and made it clear that the views of the Mc-
Reynolds dissent should prevail.
"'His last official action, on January 20, 1941, was to join with Chief
Justice Hughes in concurrence in a dissent written by Mr. Justice Stone
in the Davidowitz case. The majority, in an opinion by Mr. Justice
Black, held that a Pennsylvania alien-registration statute was in-
valid as in conflict with the Federal Alien Registration Act, which
was held to have occupied the field to the exclusion of State legislation.
The dissenters saw no conflict between the two acts and warned: "At
a time when the exercise of the federal power is being rapidly expanded
through Congressional action, it is difficult to overstate the importance
of safeguarding against such diminution of state power by vague
inferences as to what Congress might have intended if it had con-
sidered the matter or by reference to our own conceptions of a policy
which Congress has not expressed and which is not plainly to be in-
ferred from the legislation which it has enacted.
* Little aid
can be derived from the vague and illusory but often repeated formula
that Congress 'by occupying the field' has excluded from it all state
legislation. Every Act of Congress occupies some field, but we must
know the boundaries of that field before we can say that it has pre-
cluded a state from the exercise of any power reserved to it by the
Constitution."
*
*
""This last official act is wholly reminiscent of his 1926 dissent and
exemplifies the unchangeableness that was McReynolds.
"'His most famous dissent, one of the most dramatic ever delivered
from the bench of the Supreme Court, was his dissent from the de-
cision of the Court in the "gold-clause cases." He was joined in it by
Justices Van Devanter, Sutherland, and Butler. He completely de-
parted from his written opinion and went to the country with an ex-
temporaneous denunciation of repudiation of contracts and devalua-
tion of the currency which electrified his auditors, sympathetic and
unsympathetic alike. No stenographic transcript of what he said was
taken. His remarks were quoted only fragmentarily, in the press. It
was feared that they would be lost to posterity. Justice McReynolds
15

WEDNESDAY, MARCH 31, 1948
203
himself prepared a revision of his remarks, which was published by
the Wall Street Journal as the most authentic version. Many who
heard the utterance will remember passages that do not appear in
that version and will remember differently many that do appear. He
has often been quoted as saying, "The Constitution is gone." It is
believed the expression he used was, "The Constitution, as we have
known it, is gone."
""Among the stronger expressions contained in Justice McReynolds'
own revision are the following:
"""Mr. Justice Van Devanter, Mr. Justice Sutherland, Mr. Justice
Butler, and I do not accept the conclusions announced by the court.
The record reveals clear purpose to bring about confiscation of private
rights and repudiation of national obligations. To us, these things
are abhorrent. We cannot believe the wise men who framed the Con-
stitution intended to authorize them. On the contrary, adequate words
of inhibition are there.
*

*
*
"""First, the President is granted power to depreciate the dollar.
He fixed sixty cents. Next, attempt is made to destroy private obliga-
tions by 'A Statute to Regulate the Currency of the United States.'
Also to destroy Government obligations. The same language-the
same section-covers both. Having put out five hundred million Gold
Clause bonds in May, Congress declares in June that these promises
so to pay in gold are illegal and contrary to existing public policy,
although this had been consistently observed for many years and had
been approved by the courts.
"""After this effort to destroy the gold clause, the dollar is depre-
ciated to sixty cents. Prices are to be estimated in deflated dollars.
Mortgages, bank deposits, insurance funds, everything that thrifty
men have accumulated, is subject to this depreciation. And we are
told there is no remedy.
"""We venture to say that the Constitution gives no such arbitrary
power. It was not there originally; it was not there yesterday; it is
not properly there today.

"""It is said that the National Government has made by these
transactions $2,800,000,000 and that all gold hypothecated to the
Treasury now may be used to discharge public obligations! If the
dollar be depreciated to five cents or possibly one, then, through
fraud, all government obligations could be discharged quite simply.
"""Shame and humiliation are upon us now. Moral and financial
chaos may confidently be expected."
""This fervid dissent accords with the view he himself had expressed
many years before in another dissenting opinion that "an amorphous
750009-48- -68

204
dummy, unspotted by human emotions" is not "a becoming receptacle
for judicial power."
"So much discussion of his dissents should not cast doubt on his
profound contribution to jurisprudence in his many majority opinions
throughout his long period of service. His dissents became more and
more numerous after 1933. But throughout his long judicial career
he made such a continuous and constructive contribution to judicial
decision, in so many fields of the law, that it would be impracticable
in these resolutions to attempt a summarization. That contribution
will ever stand as vitally significant in the history of the period, of
the Court and of its jurisprudence.
"James Clark McReynolds was born in Elkton, Kentucky, on
February 3, 1862, of Scotch-Irish descent, the son of Dr. John O. and
Ellen (Reeves) McReynolds. His father was determined that he
should be a professional man, a doctor or a lawyer, and sent him to
Vanderbilt University, where he received the degree of Bachelor of
Science in 1882, completing a four-year course in three years. He took
first honors in his class, received the Founders' Gold Medal, and was
elected valedictorian by his classmates.
""He received his law degree from the Department of Law of the
University of Virginia in 1884. Returning to Nashville, Tenn., he
began the practice of law and also served as a member of the faculty
of the Vanderbilt Law School. He achieved a considerable reputation
by his zeal, diligence and ability in the practice there. In 1903 Philan-
der C. Knox, Republican Attorney General, was looking for a $30,000-
a-year lawyer who would work for $5,000. A friend gave him the
name of James Clark McReynolds but warned that he was a Demo-
crat. Mr. Knox said that he wanted a lawyer, not a politician, and
he made the young Tennessee lawyer Assistant Attorney General and
put him in charge of antitrust prosecutions. In this position McRey-
nolds remained from 1903 to 1907 and successfully prosecuted many
important cases. Thereafter he practiced for several years in New
York City.
"Later he came back to the Department of Justice as Special
Assistant to the Attorney General and successfully prosecuted and
argued in the Supreme Court the celebrated American Tobacco Com-
pany case, which was argued in January 1910, reargued in January
1911, and decided on May 29, 1911, and the famous Temple Iron Com-
pany case, decided December 16, 1912.
"He served as Attorney General in President Wilson's cabinet in
1913 and 1914, in which position he had a stormy and controversial
career. He was bitterly attacked by a group of Senators led by
Senator Borah and Senator Works on a charge that he maintained
a corps of special agents operating a system of espionage to investi-

WEDNESDAY, MARCH 31, 1948
205
gate Federal judges with a view to influencing their decisions. A
Senate resolution called on him for information regarding the matters
charged, "so far as not incompatible with the public interest." He
made a report to the President on August 6, 1913, transmitted also
to the Senate, in which he took an unyielding position. He described
the kind of investigating agents he maintained. He said that the
disclosure of their names would be incompatible with the public in-
terest. On the same ground he refused to name any judge who had
been investigated, except Judge Archbald, whose impeachment trial
was public property. And he sternly declared, "The suggestion that
the Department of Justice is maintaining a system of espionage over
the courts and judges of the country is entirely without foundation."
"He was nominated Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of
the United States by President Wilson in August 1914, to succeed
Justice Horace Harmon Lurton, who had died July 12, 1914. He
was confirmed by the Senate on August 29, 1914. He took the oath
of office September 5, 1914. The judicial oath was administered to
him and he took his seat on the bench at the opening of the following
October Term. His first opinion for the Court was handed down
on November 30, 1914; his last on January 20, 1941, twenty-six years
and almost two months later.
""The personnel of the Court when he took his seat in 1914 was:
Chief Justice Edward Douglass White and Associate Justices Joseph
McKenna, Oliver Wendell Holmes, William R. Day, Charles Evans
Hughes, Willis Van Devanter, Joseph Rucker Lamar, Mahlon Pitney,
and James Clark McReynolds.
""When he retired on February 1, 1941, the personnel of the Court
was Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes (who followed him in
retirement on June 2, 1941) and Associate Justices James Clark Mc-
Reynolds (the senior Justice), Harlan Fiske Stone, Owen J. Roberts,
Hugo L. Black, Stanley Reed, Felix Frankfurter, William O. Doug-
las, and Frank Murphy.
. "'His twenty-six years of service on the bench saw the passing
from the scene of every member of the Court as constituted when he
took his seat, except Charles Evans Hughes, who had returned as Chief
Justice after an interval of fourteen years following his retirement
to run for the Presidency against Woodrow Wilson, and likewise saw
the passing of such intervening famous personalities as George Suther-
land, Pierce Butler, Louis Dembitz Brandeis, and Benjamin N.
Cardozo.
"'His career was fittingly epitomized by Chief Justice Hughes when
he said, after the opening of the Court on February 3,
1941:
"On February 1, 1941, Mr. Justice James Clark McReynolds
retired from active service as Associate Justice of this Court.
狮

WEDNESDAY, MARCH 31, 1948
206
Forthright, independent, maintaining with strength and tenac-
ity of conviction his conceptions of constitutional right, he has
served with distinction upon this bench for upwards of twenty-
six years and has left a deep impress upon the jurisprudence of
the Court. It is hoped that, relieved of the burden of active
service, he will enjoy his accustomed vigor of body and mind.
""After his retirement, Justice McReynolds made his home at 2400
Sixteenth Street NW., Washington, D. C. He had never married
and for many years was the only bachelor on the Court.
"'He had an idiosyncrasy against smoking, which he applied with
some rigor against his law clerks and which was generally respected
by his guests. Yet he was a charming and gracious host and his
Sunday morning breakfasts were famous. He loved duck hunting
and golf. He was a great walker. He was a discriminating lover
of books and a deep student of history.
"A revealing side of his character was his gentleness and gen-
erosity to the humble and to those in need. During World War II
he adopted thirty-three British children, supported them and per-
sonally corresponded with every one of them. Cartoons in the press
treated the crusty old bachelor Justice as having outdone the old
woman who lived in a shoe. His love of children is also shown by his
many benefactions to the Children's Hospital of the District of Co-
lumbia. He made many unheralded benefactions to charities and
to needy individuals during his lifetime, and in his last will and
testament he left charitable bequests totaling nearly $190,000 and
many additional individual bequests.
66
"After several weeks of illness in Walter Reed Hospital, he died
on August 24, 1946, and was buried in the family burial ground in
Elkton, Kentucky.
"Men will always differ in their views of James Clark McRey-
nolds as they differ in their attitudes toward constitutional questions.
But no one can doubt that he was a man of great character and power,
a significant figure in a time of great change, unshakable in his de-
votion to the public welfare as he conceived it and to constitutional
principles in which he had the sincerest and profoundest belief.
"Resolved, That the foregoing Minute be adopted; that a copy
of it be transmitted to the Attorney General of the United States
for presentation to the Court, and that the Chairman be directed
to forward copies of it to the next of kin of Mr. Justice McReynolds." "
Mr. Attorney General Clark addressed the Court as follows:
"Mr. Chief Justice and Associate Justices, as we gather here today
I deem it a privilege to speak in memory of the late Mr. Justice
James Clark McReynolds, who passed away on August 24, 1946.
M

"Mr. Justice McReynolds was born on February 3, 1862, at Elkton,
Kentucky. He was educated in Tennessee, and received the degree
of Bachelor of Science with highest honors from Vanderbilt Univer-
sity when barely 20 years of age. Entering the University of Virginia
he was graduated from the Department of Law of that institution
two years later. He thereupon entered upon the private practice in
Nashville, Tenn., serving at the same time as a member of the faculty
of the Vanderbilt Law School. His competence and enthusiasm for
his work soon became widely known and greatly respected:
"In 1903 Attorney General Philander C. Knox recognized in
McReynolds the type of lawyer he was seeking-a $30,000-a-year
man, as Knox himself put it, who would work for $5,000 a year.
McReynolds was his man. He became Assistant Attorney General
and was placed in charge of antitrust prosecutions.
"The so-called 'trust busting' era from 1903 to 1907 was the period
during which McReynolds held that position. He was unstintingly
active in the making of this history. Later he was destined to give
completely of himself in assisting in the development of the law on
the Bench of this Court.
"The late Justice left the Federal service in 1907 and began the
practice of law in New York City. In 1913, however, President
Wilson invited him to accept the office of Attorney General of the
United States, and in March of that year he assumed his duties as
head of the Federal Department of Justice. He served in this
capacity until he was nominated as an Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court.
"His activity with regard to the development of antitrust law is
especially worthy of note. He prosecuted most of the important
antitrust cases of his time. His prosecution and presentation of the
case that broke the grip of the Tobacco Trust are said to have been
brilliant. He was active in the suit brought against the Reading
Company to end monopolistic control of the anthracite coal industry,
and he vigorously conducted the New Haven Railroad case that
attacked the New England transportation monopoly. He successfully
fought the concentration of wire communications in the hands of the
American Telephone and Telegraph Company and forced the dissolu-
tion of the combination created when the Union Pacific Railroad
Company acquired control of the Southern Pacific Company.
"Perhaps the best known of all the cases with which McReynolds
was associated was the famous suit against the American Tobacco
Company. The Tobacco Trust case, as it was called, was twice
argued before the Supreme Court by some of the most eminent lawyers
of the day. In its decision, rendered in 1911, this Court fixed into
permanence the "rule of reason" which had first been stated in the
$4

WEDNESDAY, MARCH 31, 1948
earlier decision dissolving the Standard Oil Trust.
208
It is not too
much to say that this interpretation colored all subsequent develop-
ment of the Sherman Antitrust Act, and it was certainly a basic
factor in the enactment and content of the Clayton Antitrust Act
and the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914.
"Mr. McReynolds' tenure as Attorney General lasted a little over a
year, and terminated with his accession to the Bench of this Court.
He was nominated by President Wilson in August of 1914, to fill
the vacancy left by the death of Justice Horace Harmon Lurton on
July 12 of that year. He took his seat on this Bench at the opening
of the October 1914 term. He sat as a member of the Court from
that time until February 1, 1941, when by retirement he ended twenty-
seven years' service as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of
the United States. After retiring he remained in Washington where
he died on August 24, 1946.
"I should like to refer, Mr. Chief Justice and Associate Justices, to
the character and philosophy of the late Mr. Justice McReynolds.
"I suppose that the salient points in his character and philosophy
were a rigid righteousness, an unyielding determination, and unshak-
able stability. When he felt deeply on a question, his view absorbed
him so completely that he had the greatest' difficulty in moderating
his expression, or in tolerating sustained argument by those who op-
posed him. Those who were present when this Court rendered its
decision in the Gold Clause cases report that Justice McReynolds was
almost beside himself with feeling as he spoke extemporaneously in
dissent. He could not be tolerant on an issue which seemed to him so
deeply of the essence of our national honesty and honor. He could
not be cool and detached in the face of what he considered to be a
repudiation of right conduct on the part of our Government.
"Justice McReynolds' judicial philosophy always limited him to the
naked question at bar. It prevented him from unnecessarily express-
ing an opinion on related issues in obiter dicta, and it made his style
terse and direct. A well-known manifestation of this characteristic
was his three-paragraph dissenting opinion in the case of Oregon-
Washington Railroad & Navigation Company v. State of Washington,
in 270 U. S. 87, 103 (1926). There, in discussing the validity of a
state statute of Washington, where the Congress had legislated on the
broad subject by delegating authority to the Secretary of Agricul-
ture, but where the Secretary had not acted, Justice McReynolds dis-
agreed with the view of the majority of the Court that the State
statute was unconstitutional. His style and his philosophy are both
illustrated by the concluding paragraph of that short dissent, where
he stated that ‘It is a serious thing to paralyze the efforts of a state
to protect her people against impending calamity, and leave them to
the slow charity of a far-off and perhaps supine Federal bureau. No
1'

209
such purpose should be attributed to Congress unless indicated beyond
reasonable doubt.'
"Justice McReynolds was persevering and stable in his character
and in his views.
“Philosophically, morally, professionally, Justice McReynolds re-
mained constant-changing but little, if any. When he began his
career he was thought to be rather radical in his views, particularly
on public business; when his active life ended in retirement, his posi-
tion was considered conservative. But Justice McReynolds himself
was neither liberal nor conservative. It was simply that the nation
was more conservative than he at the beginning of his career, and more
liberal at its end. It was the times-the public, popular political
preferences, the world situation—that changed and not he. During
history's shifting of scenes on the stage of political and social move-
ment, this man remained an enduring rock of fixed location, a philo-
sophical bench mark from which a historian might survey the past or
future temper of the nation.
"Justice McReynolds could not have been otherwise. His code of
honor was inflexible and unyielding. He could no more yield at the
end of his career to the proponents of a progressivism with which
he disagreed than he could have given way at the beginning of his
career to those who upheld the older order. He was strong in his
beliefs, and his feeling endured that those beliefs were right.
"The late Justice was the prototype of the rugged individualist, be-
lieving firmly in man living independently and untrammeled by
restrictions. He opposed monopoly and power, whether such power
was exercised by private interest or by public, whether it arose from
the concentration of wealth and strength in the hands of individual
citizens, or whether it resulted from an expansion by the Federal
Government whose authority he feared as overflowing the banks
formed by the Constitution.
man.
"Contrary to public belief Mr. Justice McReynolds was not a lonely
He loved the company of those who shared his views and his
principles. He had a big heart for the young and for education.
While he was in truth unbending in his political and judicial views,
he had all of the human qualities that endeared him to all who knew
him. At his death he left large bequests to Centre College-for
educational and religious purposes. During his life he followed the
practice of giving generously-and anonymously-to charity.
"On his daily walks one would hear him inquiring as to the welfare
of his neighbors and particularly the youngsters. On some occasions
his walks would be interrupted by an unkempt, hurt child. He was
never too engrossed or self-contained to stop and bend down on such
occasion to console the tot and assuage the pain, and place a coin or
two into its little hand.

"May it please this Honorable Court: In the name of the lawyers
of this nation, and particularly of the Bar of this Court, I respectfully
request that the resolution presented to you in memory of the late
Justice James Clark McReynolds be accepted by you, and that it,
together with the chronicle of these proceedings, be ordered kept for
all time in the records of this Court."
The Chief Justice said:
"Mr. Attorney General: In receiving the Resolutions which you have
presented, the Court expresses deep appreciation for the tribute from
the Bar of this Court to the memory of this eminent lawyer, states-
and jurist—an able and faithful member of this Court, who gave
26 years of his life in its service.
man,
"James Clark McReynolds was born in the town of Elkton, Ken-
tucky, in the second year of the War between the States. His ancestry
was of the sturdy Scotch-Irish stock which has contributed so greatly
- to the development of the American republic and which has produced
so many distinguished figures in American public life.
"James McReynolds grew to maturity during that period in our
history in which the American nation was undergoing a transition
from a society predominately agricultural in interests and outlook
to a society dominated by the interests and problems of an industrial
civilization. He was graduated from Vanderbilt University in 1882
with highest honors, was elected valedictorian of his class and was
awarded the Founder's Gold Medal. Two years later, he received
his degree in law from the University of Virginia.
"At the conclusion of his professional training, he entered into the
practice of law in Nashville, Tennessee, where he gained an enviable
reputation for diligence, ability, and integrity. During the same
period, he supplemented his activities as a practicing attorney by
serving as a member of the faculty of law at Vanderbilt University.
"In 1903, though a member of the Democratic party, he was ap-
pointed Assistant Attorney General in the administration of President
Theodore Roosevelt and was placed in charge of antitrust prosecu-
tions. He performed his important duties with distinction for four
years, leaving his post in 1907 to undertake the practice of law in
New York City. Shortly thereafter, he returned to the Department
of Justice as Special Assistant to the Attorney General and partici-
pated in some of the most important antitrust litigation of the period,
including the American Tobacco Company case.
"In March 1913, he was appointed Attorney General by the newly
elected President, Woodrow Wilson. He served in that capacity until
August 1914 when he was appointed an Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court of the United States to fill the vacancy caused by the
にと

death of Mr. Justice Lurton. He was an active member of this Court
for over twenty-six years, serving until his retirement on February 1,
1941. Death came at the age of 84 on August 24, 1946. He was
buried in the family burial ground in Elkton, Kentucky.
"Mr. Justice McReynolds performed his judicial duties during a
crucial period in American history. He entered into his office some
six weeks after the outbreak of the European phase of the first World
War. He left the bench while a second World War was raging over-
seas. In the intervening period, the nation experienced a major
economic depression. Inevitably, the impact of the events of the
time gave rise to issues of the highest importance, many of which
this Court was called upon to resolve.
"To the solution of these perplexing problems, Mr. Justice Mc-
Reynolds brought a fully matured legal philosophy. It was a set
of principles which has been given frequent expression in American
Constitutional history. It calls for strict construction of constitu-
tionally granted powers, vigorous defense of States' rights, and for
narrow confinement of governmental interference with individual
freedom of action. Mr. Justice McReynolds brought to his judicial
labors a deep conviction that the structure of this Nation had been
built on strong foundations. He believed that it was in the function-
ing of the judicial process that those foundations could best be pre-
served and strengthened; and upon that process he based his greatest
hopes for our future welfare. He also believed, as he once remarked,
that the power of this Court 'does not lie in the army, it does not lie
in the navy, nor in the militia; it lies in the faith of the people for
whom it was created
For over twenty-six years Mr. Jus-
tice McReynolds consistently applied these principles with zeal, ability,
and diligence, and with a conviction and intensity which could not
brook compromise. 'Constitutional guarantees,' he wrote upon one
occasion, 'were intended to be immutable essences within our char-
ter
*. Certain fundamentals have been put beyond experi-
mentation.' But, in his view, the function of the judge is not that
of a mere automaton. Thus, in his dissent in Berger v. United States,
255 U. S. 22, 43, he remarked: 'And while "an overspeaking judge is
no well-tuned cymbal" neither is an amorphous dummy unspotted by
human emotions a becoming receptacle for judicial power.'
* *
*
**
"During his long tenure upon the bench, Mr. Justice McReynolds
expressed his views, both in majority and dissent, in a great number
of cases presenting the immense variety of problems which come
before this Court. His opinions reveal a conscious and continuing
effort to decide no more than required by the issues of the particular
case before him. His writing shows little taste for epigram. His
literary style, characteristic of the man, was terse, direct, and clear,
750009-48-
-69

WEDNESDAY, MARCH 31, 1948
212
翻
yet capable of translating to the reader the conviction and fervor
with which his views were expressed. He wrote during a period
when the integration of our society through a developing indus-
trialism and the rapid growth of transportation and communication
necessitated adjustments between the roles of the federal and state
governments; but he never lost sight of the place of the States in
the American governmental system. He appreciated the importance
of private property in our economy and recognized that the mainte-
nance of law and order is fundamental to the national welfare. The
expression that his opinions give to those views reinforces the basic
constitutional theories that governed his decisions.
"Mr. Justice McReynolds was a man of broad intellectual interests.
He was a generous host, and greatly enjoyed the company of his
friends. The welfare of children was a matter of genuine concern
to him. Upon his retirement from the Court, he 'adopted' and sup-
ported thirty-three British children whose homes had been destroyed
by the bombings of London. His interest in these innocent victims
of war was personal and profound. He gave a further practical
manifestation of his concern by offering to contribute the first $10,000
to a $10,000,000 Save the Children Fund. His will contained numer-
oust bequests to charities dedicated to child welfare and to others
concerned with the care of the weak and the helpless. Throughout
his life, Mr. Justice McReynolds was interested in the education of
young people. His will contained several substantial gifts to institu-
tions providing legal education, reflecting an interest derived from
his long career as teacher of law, practitioner, and judge. But he
was concerned, not only with professional training, but also with the
problems of general education. Thus his will contained bequests to
liberal arts colleges such as Centre College at Danville, Kentucky,
an institution which he loved, though of which he was not an
alumnus.
"Above all, Mr. Justice McReynolds was a man of sincerity and
independence. His views on the controversial issues of his time.
were, to him, matters of vital moral conviction. In their defense,
he dedicated the full resources of his spirit and character. It is not
surprising that his views evoked strong response, both in support
and opposition. But even those of a different philosophy found
much to admire in his absolute integrity and his rugged forthright-
ness. Complete conformity in thought and opinion has never been
considered a virtue in this Republic. It is a basic tenet of our
political doctrine that out of the clash of opposing views we are
most likely to approach truth. So long as that is our faith, we will
pay tribute to the memory of a man who never deviated from the
path of principles which to him were fundamental to the nation's
welfare."

Druggan. Mr. Weymouth Kirkland was the associate counsel
with JUSTICE JACKSON in the large money affairs of Mr. Drug-

The facts are that I never have been general counsel or counsel of
any character for any person named Terry Druggan, never to my
knowledge saw or met such a person, do not know who he might be,
where he resides or what his affairs consist of. Neither in this nor in
any other matter was I ever associated professionally with Mr. Wey-
mouth Kirkland, nor has he at any time communicated directly or

ORDER
292
It is ordered that rules 51, 52, 53, and 54 of the Rules of Practice
for the Courts of the United States in Admiralty and Maritime Juris-
diction be, and they are hereby, amended to read as follows:
RULE 51. Limitation of Liability-How Claimed. The owner
or owners of any vessel who shall desire to claim the benefit of
limitation of liability provided for in the third and fourth sec-
tions of the Act of March 3, 1851, entitled "An Act to limit the
liability of shipowners and for other purposes" (Sections 183 to
189 of Title 46 of the U. S. Code) as now or hereafter amended
or supplemented, may file a petition in the proper District Court
of the United States, as hereinafter specified. Such petition shall
set forth the facts and circumstances on which limitation of lia-
bility is claimed, and pray proper relief in that behalf. It shall
also state facts showing that the petition is filed in the proper
district; the voyage on which the demands sought to be limited
arose, with the date and place of its termination; the amount of
all demands including all unsatisfied liens or claims of lien, in
contract or in tort, arising on that voyage, so far as known to the
petitioner, and what suits, if any, are pending thereon; whether
the vessel was damaged, lost or abandoned, and, if so, when and
where; the value of the vessel at the close of the voyage or, in case
of wreck, the value of her wreckage, strippings or proceeds, if
any, and where and in whose possession they are; and the amount
of any pending freight recovered or recoverable. If any of the
above particulars are not fully known to the petitioner, a state-
ment of such particulars according to the best knowledge, infor-
mation, and belief of the petitioner shall be sufficient. With his
petition the petitioner may, if he so elects, file an interim stipula-
tion, with sufficient sureties or an approved corporate surety, for
the payment into court whenever the court shall so order, of the
aggregate amount of the value of petitioner's interest in the vessel
at the close of the voyage or, in case of wreck, the value of the
wreckage, strippings or proceeds, and of any pending freight re-
covered or recoverable, with interest at six percent per annum
from the date of the stipulation, and costs. If such interim stipu-
lation is filed, it shall be accompanied by an affidavit or affidavits
of a competent person or persons corroborating the statement in
the petition as to value of the vessel, or her wreckage, etc., and her
freight. Said court, having caused due appraisement to be had of
the value of petitioner's interest in the vessel, or her wreckage, etc.,
and her freight shall make an order for the payment of the same
into court, or for the giving of a stipulation, with sufficient sure-
ties or an approved corporate surety, for the payment thereof into
court with interest at six percent per annum from the date of the
stipulation, whether interim or final, and costs, whenever the same
shall be ordered; or, if the petitioner shall so elect, the court
without such appraisement shall make an order for the transfer
by the petitioner of his interest in such vessel, or her wreckage,
etc., and freight to a trustee to be appointed by the court under
the fourth section of said Act.

MONDAY, JUNE 21, 1948

If a surrender of petitioner's interest in the vessel or her wreck-
age, etc., is offered to be made to a trustee, the petition must
further show any prior paramount liens thereon, and what
voyage or trips, if any, she has made since the voyage or trip on
which the claims sought to be limited arose, and any existing liens
arising upon any such subsequent voyage or trip, with the amounts
and causes thereof, and the names and addresses of the lienors,
so far as known; and whether the vessel sustained any injury
upon or by reason of such subsequent voyage or trip.
Upon the filing of such interim stipulation, or upon deter-
mination of value by appraisal and compliance with the court's
order with respect thereto, or upon compliance with a surrender
order, as the case may be, the court shall issue a monition against
all persons asserting claims in respect to which the petition seeks
limitation, citing them to file their respective claims with the
Clerk of said court and to serve on or mail to the proctors for
the petitioner a copy thereof on or before a date to be named in
said writ which shall be not less than 30 days after issuance of
the same, which time the court, for cause shown, may enlarge.
Notice of the monition shall be published in such newspaper or
newspapers as the court by rule or order may direct in substan-
tially the following form, once in each week for four successive
weeks before the return day of the monition:

U. S. Marshal.
The petitioner not later than the day of second publication
shall also mail a copy of the above notice (copy of the monition

MONDAY, JUNE 21, 1948
294
need not be mailed) to every person known to have made any
claim against the vessel or the petitioner arising out of the voyage
or trip on which the claims sought to be limited arose. In cases
involving death a copy of such notice, together with a copy of
Rule 52, shall be mailed to the decedent at his last-known address,
and also to any person who shall be known to have made any
claim on account of such death.
The said court shall also, on the application of the petitioner,
make an order to restrain the further prosecution of all and any
suit or suits against the petitioner and/or said vessel in respect
to any claim or claims subject to limitation in the proceeding.
RULE 52. Filing and Proof of Claim in Limited Liability Pro-
ceedings.-Claims shall be filed with the Clerk of the Court in
writing under oath and a copy shall be served upon the proctor
for the petitioner on or before the return day of the monition.
Each claim shall specify the various allegations of fact upon
which the claimant relies in support of his claim, the items thereof,
and the dates on which the same accrued. Within thirty days
after the return day of the monition or within such time as the
Court thereafter may allow, the petitioner shall mail to the
proctor for each claimant (or if the claimant have no proctor to
the claimant himself) a list setting forth (a) the name of each
claimant, (b) the name and address of his proctor or attorney
(if he is known to have one), (c) the nature of his claim, i. e.,
whether property loss, property damage, death, personal injury,
etc., and (d) the amount thereof.
Whenever an interim stipulation has been filed as provided in
Rule 51, any person claiming damages as aforesaid, who shall
have filed his claim under oath, may file an exception controverting
the value of the vessel at the close of the voyage, or, in case of
wreck, the value of her wreckage, strippings or proceeds, and the
amount of her pending freight, and the amount of the interim
stipulation based thereon, and thereupon the court shall cause
due appraisement to be had of the value of petitioner's interest
in the vessel, or her wreckage, etc., and her freight; and if the
court finds that the amount of the interim stipulation is either
insufficient or excessive, the court shall make an order for the
payment of the proper amount into court or, as the case may be,
for a reduction in the amount of the stipulation or for the giving
of an additional stipulation.
Proof of all claims which shall be filed in pursuance of said
monition shall thereafter be made before a commissioner to be
designated by the court, or before the court as the court may
determine, subject to the right of any person interested to question
or controvert the same; but no objection to any claim need be
filed by any party to the proceeding; and on the completion of
said proofs, the commissioner shall make report, or the court its
findings on the claims so proven, and on confirmation of said
commissioner's report, after hearing any exceptions thereto, or on
such finding by the court, the moneys paid or secured to be paid
into court as aforesaid or the proceeds of said vessel, or her

MONDAY, JUNE 21, 1948
295
wreckage, etc., and freight (after payment of costs and expenses)
shall upon determination of liability be divided pro rata, subject
to all provisions of law thereto, appertaining, amongst the sev-
eral claimants in proportion to the amount of their respective
claims, duly proved and confirmed as aforesaid, saving, however,
to all parties any priority to which they may be legally entitled.
RULE 53. Rights of Owner to Contest Liability and of Claim-
ants to Contest Exoneration from Liability or Limitation of
Liability of Owner.-In the proceedings aforesaid, the petitioner
shall be at liberty to contest his liability, or the liability of said
vessel, provided he shall have complied with the requirements of
Rule 51 and shall also have given a bond for costs and provided
that in his petition he shall state the facts and circumstances by
reason of which exoneration from liability is claimed; and any
person claiming damages as aforesaid who shall have filed his
claim under oath and intends to contest the right to exoneration or
limitation, shall file an answer to such petition, and serve a copy
on proctor for petitioner, and may contest the right of the owner
or owners of said vessel, either to an exoneration from liability
or to a limitation of liability under the said Act of Congress, or
both, provided such answer shall in suitable allegations state the
facts and circumstances by reason of which liability is claimed or
right to limitation should be denied.
RULE 54. Courts Having Cognizance of Limited Liability Pro-
cedure. The said petition shall be filed and the said proceedings
had in any District Court of the United States in which said vessel
has been libeled to answer for any claim in respect to which the
petitioner seeks to limit liability; or, if the said vessel has not been
libeled, then in the District Court for any district in which the
owner has been sued in respect to any such claim. When the said
vessel has not been libeled to answer the matters aforesaid, and
suit has not been commenced against the said owner, the said pro-
ceedings may be had in the District Court of the district in which
the said vessel may be, but if said vessel is not within any district
and no suit has been commenced in any district, then the petition
be filed in any District Court. The District Court may, in its
discretion, transfer the proceedings to any district for the con-
venience of the parties. If the vessel shall have already been sold,
the proceeds shall represent the same for the purposes of these
rules.

No. 12, original. The United States of America, complainant, v.
The State of California. In our opinion of June 23, 1947, we stated

MONDAY, JUNE 21, 1948
296
that it might later become necessary to have hearings "in order to
determine with greater definiteness particular segments of the bound-
ary" between California and the marginal sea over which the United
States has paramount rights and power (332 U. S. 19,26). Our decree
of October 27, 1947, reserved jurisdiction to enter such further orders
and to issue such writs as might from time to time be necessary (332
U. S. 804, 805).
The Government has now filed a petition praying that the precise
boundary as to certain segments of the California coastal area be
ascertained. It urges that there exists a definite need for a prompt
determination in this respect. California has answered, agreeing
that there is need for prompt determination of the boundaries as to the
segments designated by the Government, but it urges that there is also
need for a prompt determination of the precise California coastal
boundary all the way from Oregon to Mexico.
California's petition for an ascertainment of the entire coastal
boundary at this time is denied.
The Court is in doubt at this time as to what particular segments
of the boundary, if any, should now be determined.
It is therefore of the opinion that a master should be appointed by
the Chief Justice to make inquiry into this subject and to hold hear-
ings, if he finds it necessary, in order to make recommendations to
this Court at the October, 1948, Term, as to what particular portions
of the boundary call for precise determination and adjudication.
Should the master conclude that such adjudications should be made,
he is also authorized to recommend to this Court an appropriate pro-
cedure to be followed in determining the precise boundary of such
segments.
It is so ordered. Mr. Justice Jackson took no part in the considera-
tion or decision of this question.
No. 52. Estate of Sidney M. Spiegel, Deceased, Katherine J. Spie-
gel, et al., Surviving Executors, etc., petitioners, v. Commissioner of
Internal Revenue; and
No. 96. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, petitioner, v. Estate of
Francois L. Church, Deceased, Edward E. Black, Executor. Each of
these cases is ordered restored to the docket and is assigned for reargu-
ment. In their briefs and on oral argument counsel are requested to
discuss particularly the following questions insofar as they are relevant
to the respective cases:
1. Assuming that, under the applicable state law, there was no possi-
bility of reverter and no interest of any other kind retained or arising
in favor of the settlor or his estate under the transfer made in trust,

MONDAY, JUNE 21, 1948
297
inter vivos, did section 811 (c) of the Internal Revenue Code require
that the value of the corpus of the trust be included in the settlor's
gross estate for federal estate-tax purposes? That is, did section 811
(c) require the inclusion in the gross estate of the settlor of the value
of the corpus of a trust, created inter vivos, merely because the settlor
had provided in it that, upon his death, the trust should terminate
and the corpus be distributed to designated beneficiaries then surviving?
2. Assuming that, under the applicable state law, there arose, by
operation of law, a possible reverter in favor of the settlor's estate,
did section 811 (c) require that the value of the corpus, in view of the
record in the case, be included in the settlor's gross estate for federal
estate-tax purposes?
3. Did section 811 (c) of the Internal Revenue Code, in 1939, re-
quire the inclusion in the settlor's gross estate of the value of the
corpus of a trust because the settlor, by its terms, had, in 1924, reserved
to himself a right to the income of the trust until his death, the reserva-
tion thus being made before the March 3, 1931, amendment of that
section?
4. Were the joint congressional resolution of 1931 (46 Stat. 1516–
1517), and subsequent related estate-tax statutes, intended to be a
repudiation of this Court's May v. Heiner (281 U. S. 238) interpreta-
tion of the estate-tax statutes?
5. Did the May v. Heiner estate-tax interpretation survive the con-
gressional resolution and this Court's holding and opinion in Helver-
ing v. Hallock (309 U.S. 106)?
*
*
*
6. Under section 811 (c) is the "possession and enjoyment” of the
corpus of an inter vivos trust "intended to take effect
at or
after" the settlor's death, where he names himself as cotrustee with
the broad control and administrative powers over the corpus and
income here vested, and where the corpus is withheld from the bene-
ficiaries until the settlor's death?
7. In the light of this Court's opinion in Helvering v. Hallock does
the Hassett v. Welch (303 U. S. 303) interpretation of the 1931 con-
gressional resolution have controlling relevance in determining whether
the estate tax shall be applied to the Church properties transferred to
beneficiaries under a trust created before 1931 but in which Church
retained the net income from the trust properties during his life?
8. Assuming that under the "refined technicalities of the law of
property" the "possession and enjoyment" of the trust properties here
be deemed to have passed to the beneficiaries when the trust was
created, are the transfers so much “akin to testamentary dispositions"
as to make them subject to the estate-tax statutes? (See Helvering v.
Hallock, p. 112.)

9. What is the effect of the rulings of Helvering v. Clifford (309
U. S. 331) upon these trusts?
Mr. Justice Frankfurter and Mr. Justice Jackson disapprove the
foregoing because it includes hypothetical and argumentive ques-
tions not raised by either counsel or necessary to decision of the case.
