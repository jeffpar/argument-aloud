No. 15, original. The State of Oklahoma, complainant, v. The
State of Texas, defendant; The United States of America, inter-
vener.
1. The motion of the defendant, the State of Texas, for leave
to file an amended counterclaim relating to the interstate boundary
along the one hundredth meridian is granted; and the complain-
ant, the State of Oklahoma, and the intervener, the United States
of America, are severally given until and including the first Mon-
day of October next within which to answer such amended counter-
claim.
2. On consideration of the response made by J. H. Duhon and
H. J. Kebideaux to the order to show cause issued against them on
May 5, 1924, such response is found insufficient and it is ordered
that an injunction be issued directing that they dismiss the action
brought by them against the receiver in this cause in the District
Court of Wichita County, Tex., and that they refrain from taking
any other proceeding or step in that action.
3. The report of the boundary commissioners of the survey and
platting of the medial line of Red River in the vicinity of the river-
bed wells, pursuant to the order of June 4, 1923, 262 U. S. 505, is
approved and adopted. The report of such commissioners of the
time employed and expense incurred in that work is also approved,
and the receiver is directed to pay the sums specified in such report
and to charge the same against the impounded funds derived from
the river-bed wells.
4. On consideration of the motion of the State of Texas that
the receiver pay out of the proceeds of the receivership wells south
of the interstate boundary the production tax prescribed by the
laws of that State, it is ordered that the receiver be authorized,
out of the impounded proceeds from every such well, to pay such
tax in respect of such impounded proceeds and to charge the same
against such well as an expense specially pertaining to it. But
before making any such payment the receiver shall request the
attorney general of the State of Texas, and the parties interested
in the fund from which the payment is to be made, to submit to
him definite statements showing the amount of the tax and whether
it has been otherwise paid. If in any instance the receiver is in
doubt respecting the propriety of the payment he shall withhold
it and report the matter to this court for further instructions.
5. The receiver is instructed to distribute pro rata over the im-
pounded funds in his custody all interest received on receivership
moneys, all discounts collected and all other similar items of profit
arising from the general operations or business of the receivership,
and not from particular wells.

MONDAY, JUNE 9, 1924
297
6. The receiver is authorized to take all proper steps to obtain
payment of all accounts and claims that may be due or owing to
him as such receiver and to report to the court at its next term
all of such accounts and claims as then may remain unpaid with
his recommendations respecting the measures to be taken to enforce
payment.
7. The receiver is directed to publish a final notice to all persons
asserting or holding claims against him or the receivership arising
out of matters accruing since the claims' notice of June 1, 1921, to
present such claims within 40 days after the first publication of such
notice, in default of which the claims will be barred.
8. The receiver is instructed to make no reimbursement, under
the order of June 1, 1921, 256 U. S. 607, or otherwise, to any operator
or driller for work done on any river-bed well prior to the receiver-
ship where the well has proved to be a dry hole or unproductive; and
all applications and suggestions that reimbursement be made for such
work are overruled.
9. The receiver is instructed to spread the general expenses of the
receivership over all the impounded funds in his custody in such way
that each dollar in the funds derived from river-bed wells, and in
those derived from flood-plain wells which have remained in the
operation of the receiver, will bear twice as much of such expenses
as each dollar in the funds derived from flood-plain wells which have
been operated by private claimants will bear. The spreading shall
be made evenly over all moneys in the funds bearing the lesser share
of the expenses, and evenly over all moneys in the funds bearing the
larger share. No distinction shall be made between moneys going
to owners of flood-plain wells and moneys going to lessees of such
wells. Neither shall be exempted and the spreading over the two
shall be on a pro rata basis.
10. All expenses and losses incident to work done by the re-
ceiver on river-bed wells which proved unremunerative shall be
charged against the funds derived from remunerative wells in the
river bed.
11. The receiver is authorized to pay to Tom Testermann the
sum received by the receiver on the sale by him of equipment
belonging to Mr. Testermann which had come into the possession
of the receiver.
12. The petition of Tom Testermann asking that he be reim-
bursed out of funds enuring to the Bass Petroleum Co., its suc-
cessors or assigns, for the conversion by such company, prior to
the receivership, of property claimed by Mr. Testermann is denied.
13. Notwithstanding the exception of well No. 139, known as the
Burk-Senator well, from the order of June 1, 1921, 256 U. S. 607,

MONDAY, JUNE 9, 1924
298
the receiver is authorized, in his discretion, to reimburse the oper-
ators who drilled that well prior to the receivership for the cost
of that work. if the operators who participated therein are dis-
posed to adjust the differences between them and to accept a reim-
bursement which is satisfactory to the receiver.
14. The receiver is authorized to surrender to the Secretary of
the Interior, as the representative of the United States, the posses-
sion of all of the south half of the river bed, now in the receiver-
ship, with all oil wells, pipe lines, and other property pertaining
to such river bed, the surrender to be made at the close of busi-
ness on the 30th of June, 1924, or as soon thereafter as the Sec-
retary of the Interior is prepared to take over that property.
15. The receiver is authorized to deliver to the Secretary of
the Interior, as the representative of the United States, at the
time of the surrender named in the last paragraph the office build-
ings, equipment and supplies belonging to the receivership and in-
tended for use in its oil and gas operations, the delivery to be
at a valuation agreed upon between the Secretary of the Interior
and the receiver. The agreed price shall be charged to the United
States and credited to the receiver as a partial payment to the
former of the money enuring to it as proceeds of river-bed wells.
16. The receiver is authorized to pay over to the Secretary of
the Interior, as the representative of the United States, at the
time of the surrender and delivery named in the last two para-
graphs approximately two-thirds of the net impounded funds derived
from the river-bed wells.
17. The receiver is authorized to surrender to the several owners
or lessees entitled thereto, as soon as arrangements therefor satis-
factorily can be made, the possession of the flood-plain wells which
he is now operating, together with the pipe lines and fixtures per-
taining to them. If there be controversy or doubt as to who is
entitled to any particular well the receiver shall withhold its sur-
render for the time being and pursue the course indicated in the
next paragraph of this order.
18. The receiver is instructed to publish notice to all claimants
to funds in his custody derived from flood-plain wells (meaning
wells south of the interstate boundary as now established) to pre-
sent their claims to such funds within 40 days after the first publica-
tion of such notice, the presentation to be in the form of a definite
statement of what is claimed and of the claimant's title. After the
expiration of 20 days more the receiver shall be authorized, where
there are no conflicting claims, to pay the proceeds from any well
or wells, less expenses and charges, to the proper claimant or claim-
ants. If there be controversy or doubt as to who is entitled to the
proceeds from any well the receiver shall withhold action as to such
$

ORDER
It is ordered that sections 1 and 9 of Rule 26 of this court be
amended so that said sections shall, respectively, read as follows:
"1. The court, on the first day of each term, will commence call-
ing the cases for argument in the order in which they stand on the
docket, and proceed from day to day during the term in the same
order (except as hereinafter provided); and, if the parties, or either
of them, shall be ready when the case is called, the same will be
heard; and if neither party shall be ready to proceed in the argu-
ment, the case shall be continued to the next term of the court unless
the court shall otherwise order.
"9. If, after a case has been continued under section 1, both
parties shall desire to have it heard at the same term, they may, not
later than three days before a regular motion day, file with the
Clerk their joint request to that effect accompanied by their affida-
vits or those of their counsel giving the reasons why the case was
continued and why it should be reinstated. Reinstatement shall be
made by the court only when it appears to the court that there was
good reason for the previous continuance and that the reinstatement.
can be made without prejudice to parties in other cases coming on
regularly for hearing."
ORDER. In the cases in which opinions have been handed down
to-day, ten days shall elapse before the mandates go down; and leave
is given to the parties to file such motions within that period as they
may be advised, which shall have the same effect as if filed this day.
