No. 263. Wayne K. Patterson, Warden of the Colorado State Re-

tition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for
the Tenth Circuit denied. Mr. Justice Harlan has filed the following
memorandum :
The denial of certiorari in this federal habeas corpus proceed-
ing, which involves the conditional release of a state prisoner
from a life sentence imposed upon him more than twenty-one
years ago, justifies a brief comment. The action taken below
was predicated on Colorado's alleged unconstitutional denial to
petitioner, an asserted indigent, of a free transcript of the trial
proceedings in connection with a 1940 appeal from his convic-
tion.
I find in this situation two important issues which, in my view,
are or may be deserving of this Court's plenary consideration:
(1) Was the Federal District Court entitled to re-examine the
determination of the Colorado Supreme Court that petitioner
was not indigent at the time a trial transcript was denied him,
see Medberry v. Patterson, 142 Col. 180, 350 P. 2d 571, 575, and
to make new findings that petitioner was then indigent? See
Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, at 458, 463–464, 506; (2) Does the
decision of this Court in Eskridge v. Washington State Board,
357 U.S. 214, require or justify retrospective application of the
rule of Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, in circumstances where the
State, without fault on its part, is now unable to supply peti-
tioner with a trial transcript, or otherwise to satisfy the Griffin
rule?
Although the first of these questions is presently ripe for con-
sideration by this Court, it can be said that the second question
is prematurely tendered, in that, while it is not disputed that the

MONDAY, OCTOBER 9, 1961
23
State for reasons beyond its control is no longer able to furnish
petitioner with a trial transcript, it does not yet appear that
the State is unable to furnish petitioner with other means of per-
fecting an adequate appeal record. In these circumstances I
acquiesce in the Court's denial of certiorari because such action
will not, of course, preclude the State from showing below, if it
can, that without fault on its part, it is now unable to afford, pe-
titioner other adequate means of appeal, and from further re-
course to this Court if necessary, with respect to either or both of
the above questions. See Brown v. Allen, supra, at 456-457,
488-497.

No. 304. Continental Ore Company et al., petitioners, v. Union
Carbide and Carbon Corporation et al. Petition for writ of cer-
tiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit
granted limited to Questions 2, 5, and 6 presented by the petition
which read as follows:
"2. Whether an Appellate Court can take away from a jury
the question of causal effect concerning an injury by a 100%
two-company monopoly (admittedly achieved pursuant to an
intent to monopolize) when the question of violation is confessed
and the issue of measurement of damages is more than sufficiently
supported by relevant economic data and where the destruction
of the plaintiff company (petitioners herein) was admitted to be,
by a chief executive officer of a defendant, an important goal of
the monopolists?
"5. Whether petitioners, an American company, can claim
damages under the anti-trust laws for injury caused by their
elimination from the Canadian market when it was shown that
two other American companies had entered into a conspiracy to
eliminate all competition and to monopolize the industry and
when it is shown that as part of this conspiracy one of the Amer-
ican companies utilized its domination and control over a wholly
owned Canadian subsidiary, which had been given a discretionary
power by the Canadian government to allocate the importation
of vanadium into Canada during the war, to exclude the exports
of petitioners (competitors) from entering Canada for sale to
petitioners' Canadian customers and when it is shown that the
refusal of the Canadian subsidiary to allocate vanadium to pe-
titioners' Canadian customers was directed by its American par-
ent company pursuant to the overall conspiracy to eliminate all
competition and specifically to eliminate petitioners. This issue
was erroneously decided against petitioners on the Court of Ap-
peals' manifest misapplication of this Court's recent opinion in
Eastern Railroad Pres. Conf. v. Noerr Motor Frgt., Inc. (1961),
365 U.S. 127, 81 S. Ct. 523.
"6. Whether petitioners, against whom a directed verdict was
ordered by the Appellate Court, were deprived of a trial by jury
by the Appellate Court below which weighed the evidence, made
factual rulings on the sufficiency of evidence of causation, did not
view the evidence as a whole, did not allow petitioners the bene-
fit of all their evidence, did not allow petitioners the benefit of
all inferences and presumptions to be drawn from the evidence
and did not resolve all conflicts in the evidence in favor of pe-
titioners in direct conflict with this Court's opinion in Beacon
Theatres, Inc., v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500 (1959).”

ORDERS IN PENDING CASES
No. 80. Beatrice Lynum, petitioner, v. Illinois. Consideration of
the petition for certiorari is deferred to accord counsel for petitioner
opportunity to secure a certificate from the Supreme Court of Illinios
as to whether the judgment herein was intended to rest on an adequate
and independent state ground, or whether decision of the federal
claim, identified in respondent's second response as having been as-
serted by the petitioner at pages 66-67 in her brief in the Supreme
Court of Illinois, was necessary to the judgment rendered. Cf. Loftus
v. Illinois, 334 U.S. 804; Herb v. Pitcairn, 324 U.S. 117.
Mr. Justice Frankfurter dissenting:
Petitioner was tried and convicted for the unlawful sale, dis-
pensing, and possession of narcotics, and her conviction was affirmed,
21 Ill. 2d 63, 171 N.E. 2d 17. She seeks certiorari to review the judg-
ment of the Illinois Supreme Court, on the ground that incriminat-
ing statements drawn from her by threats and promises were used
against her at trial in contravention of the Due Process Clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment. 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1257.
Rule 23 (f) of this Court requires that a petitioner seeking review
of a state court decision shall "specify the stage in the proceedings in
the court of first instance and in the appellate court, at which, and the
manner in which, the federal questions sought to be reviewed were
raised. . . ." There is no such specification in the present petition;
it is merely asserted that the Supreme Court of Illinois "overlooked
the fact" that involuntary admissions are not competent evidence.
Respondent argues that certiorari should be denied for failure to
comply with this Rule. Discovering that petitioner had invoked the
Due Process Clause in her brief before the Illinois Supreme Court,

MONDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 1961
90
this Court requested a response to this from Illinois. Respondent now
urges that the Due Process Clause was not cited until appeal, that
the Illinois Supreme Court does not determine constitutional ques-
tions unless they have been specifically raised at trial, and that the
judgment was accordingly based on an adequate and independent
ground of state law.
The opinion of the Illinois Court does not mention the claim of in-
voluntary admissions. It expressly rejects a claim that petitioner
was surprised by their introduction without proper statutory notice,
and concludes with an omnium-gatherum clause, "We have examined
numerous other allegations of error and find that they are of insuf-
ficient merit to justify further discussion. Suffice it to say that,
on the entire record, the defendant received a fair trial and was proved
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt." A petition for rehearing, assign-
ing the admission of the statements as error and citing Brown v.
Mississippi, 297 U.S. 278, was denied without opinion. An abstract
of the trial court record indicates that the admissions were objected
to a trial but does not show whether the Due Process Clause was
invoked. This Court today defers consideration of the petition pend-
ing clarification by the Illinois Court whether its disposition of the
due process issue was based on its merits or on an independent state
ground.
The constitutional basis for this Court's review of state court
judgments derives from the Supremacy Clause of Article VI, statu-
torily enforced by the famous Sec. 25 of the First Judiciary Act, 1
Stat. 73, 85 (1789), now 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1257. Accordingly, if a state
judgment rests on an adequate, independent ground of state law, this
Court is without power to review the judgment, since its decision
of the federal issue could not affect the result. Murdock v. Memphis,
20 Wall. 590, 632, 634-635; Herb v. Pitcairn, 324 U.S. 117, 125–126.
Since Judicial opinions are not mathematically formulated and the
dubieties of language are what they are, a particular opinion of a
state court sometimes raises a solid doubt whether a judgment does
rest on an adequate, independent state ground and whether the dis-
position of a federal claim was not necessary to the challenged judg-
ment. Lest a federal right properly reviewable here be lost through
such ambiguity, this Court has utilized the procedure of holding a
case here until opportunity has been afforded for an appropriate
certificate by the state court for clarification of the ambiguity, i.e.,
to make unambiguously clear that its judgment has not adjudicated a
federal claim but rests on an independent state ground. See Herb v.
Pitcairn, supra, 324 U.S., at 128; Loftus v. Illinois, 334 U.S. 804. In-
stead of awaiting this Court's initiation of such a procedure, in some
jurisdictions counsel on their own initiative secure a certificate from

MONDAY, NOVEMBER 13, 1961
91
their state tribunal in order to leave no doubt before the case is brought
here that it does turn on a claim of a federal right. See Herb v.
Pitcairn, supra, 324 U.S., at 127; Honeyman v. Hanan, 300 U.S. 14,
18; Whitney v. California, 274 U.S. 357, 360–361.
In either case, however, such a procedure for clarification does not
come into play when the state court opinion in the case sought to be
reviewed does not mention the federal ground, when counsel make no
assertion that the judgment was based on a determination of the fed-
eral issue, and when state law affords an adequate ground for the dis-
position below. On full canvass of our jurisdiction in this class of
cases, the Court not so long ago made this authoritative pronounce-
ment:
"Before we may undertake to review a decision of the court of a
State it must appear affirmatively from the record, not only that
the federal question was presented for decision to the highest
court of the State having jurisdiction but that its decision of the
federal question was necessary to the determination of the cause."
Honeyman v. Hanan, 300 U.S. 14, 18 (1937).
Thus, when the state court writes no opinion and from the record
it cannot be said that its judgment was not based on an adequate
non-federal ground, this Court will not take jurisdiction. Woods v.
Nierstheimer, 328 U.S. 211, 214-216; White v. Ragen, 324 U.S. 760,
765-767. In this case the Supreme Court of Illinois wrote an opinion,
but it did not so much as advert to the issue raised by the petition.
It cited only Illinois cases; nowhere in the opinion was there a refer-
ence to the Federal Constitution or to any decision of this Court. It is
not evident from the papers filed here that the issue was raised in
the trial court. There is not the faintest indication that the judgment
was not based on the Illinois rule that in order that an issue be re-
viewable by the State Supreme Court, it must have been explicitly
tendered at trial. Orton Crane & Shovel Co. v. Federal Reserve
Bank, 409 Ill. 285, 288–289, 99 N.E. 2d 14; People v. Cosper, 405 Ill.
543, 92 N.E. 2d 173.
It is not our business—indeed it interferes with the effective use
of our time for the conduct of our business-to be excavating records
in order to find out whether a federal question somehow or other
lurks in a record although counsel, as required by our own Rule, has
not called our attention to the place in the record where it is un-
equivocally set forth. In these circumstances, I see no reason for
asking the Supreme Court of Illinois to clarify something that does
not call for clarification. This constrains me not to join in the
Court's order.

California. The motion for appointment of counsel is denied.

Federal Power Commission et al. Petition for writ of certiorari to

Circuit denied.
Mr. Justice Black, with whom Mr. Justice Douglas concurs, dissent-
ing:
This case raises a very important question which I think we
should grant certiorari to settle. That question is whether the
Federal Power Commission has authority to refuse to summon
a witness to testify to relevant facts in a hearing before it on the
ground that the party summoning that witness refuses to com-
pensate him as an expert witness over and above the amount.
authorized to be paid witnesses in courts under 28 U.S.C. Sec.
1821.
1
The issue before the Federal Power Commission was the eco-
nomic feasibility of a project of the Blue Ridge Gas Company to
supply natural gas to Harrisonburg, Virginia. The witness de-
sired was an engineer who had previously prepared a study of
the project for Blue Ridge ¹ and who had reported to it that the
economic feasibility of the project was highly doubtful. The
subpoena requested was for the engineer to appear and bring the
papers and documents he had already prepared and used in his
previous report. This would have been offered to rebut the evi-
dence of Blue Ridge, favorable to the project, given by a second
engineer who had been hired by Blue Ridge after the first engi-
neer had given his unfavorable report. Since this evidence was
heavily relied on by the Commission in finding that the project
was feasible, there can be no doubt that the witness desired, the
first engineer, could have given evidence highly relevant to a
proper decision of the question before the Commission. Never-
theless, and in spite of the fact that Sec. 6(c) of the Adminis-
trative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 1005 (c), provides that
agency subpoenas "shall be issued to any party upon request
upon a statement or showing of general relevance and rea-
sonable scope of the evidence sought," the Commission refused
to summon the witness on the ground that petitioner "should
arrange for compensation to be paid to him as an expert witness,
and for his voluntary attendance at the hearing." 21 F.P.C. 901,

902. This petition seeks certiorari to review the decision of the
Court of Appeals, _ F. 2d _,
_ F. 2d, upholding the Commission.
-
Since petitioner was willing to pay the fees prescribed for wit-
nesses by Congress in 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1821, the issue presented
here seems to be substantially the same as that in Henkel v. Chi-
cago, St. Paul, Minneapolis, & Omaho R. Co., 284 U.S. 444.
There the plaintiff, Henkel, who had recovered a judgment
against the railroad under the FELA, asked the court for an
order allowing fees above the amounts provided in 28 U.S.C.
Sec. 1821 for ordinary witnesses in order to give extra compensa-
tion to expert witnesses who had testified in his behalf. This
Court, in an opinion by Mr. Chief Justice Hughes, unanimously
held that the only fees to expert witnesses allowable as costs in
the federal courts were those provided for in Sec. 1821. Since
that time this Court has never modified or criticized in any way
its statement that:
"The Congress has dealt with the subject comprehensive-
ly and has made no exception of the fees of expert witnesses.
Its legislation must be deemed controlling and excludes the
application in the federal courts of any different state prac-
tice." Id., at 447.2
Even so the Government seeks to justify enforced payment of
extra fees by petitioner on two grounds: (1) that the Federal
Power Commission acted within a discretion allowed it, and
(2) that the error of the Commission, if any, in refusing to sub-
poena the witness was harmless. But administrative agencies,
no more than courts, have inherent powers of discretion to nullify
the mandatory provisions of 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1821, and the Com-
mission has pointed to no statute which gives it power to compel
the payment of greater fees to expert witnesses than are paid to
witnesses who testify in the courts. As for the Commission's
argument that the error was harmless, I can find nothing in this
record to justify such a contention. The witness the Commis-
sion refused to summon had a broad knowledge of the economic
feasibility of the gas project under consideration—his unfavor-
able report apparently being chiefly responsible for the dropping
of the project once before. To sustain the Commission's conten-
tion of harmless error in this case would be to assume that no evi-
dence could possibly have been introduced that would have
changed the Commission's mind or altered the result of judicial
review of the Commission's order by the Court of Appeals. I
am not willing to make any such assumption, nor am I willing

testimony of expert witnesses.

to leave unchallenged the decision in this case which suggests
that administrative agencies have a broad discretion in matters
involving large public interests such as here to force parties before
administrative agencies to pay burdensome expert witness fees in
order to present admittedly relevant evidence to them. It is for
that reason that I am expressing my objection to the denial of
certiorari in this case.

OPINIONS PER CURIAM
131
No. . Samuel Bailey et al., appellants, v. Joe T. Patterson et al.
This is a motion for an injunction to stay the prosecution of a number
of criminal cases in the courts of Mississippi pending an appeal to
this Court from the judgment of a three-judge Federal District Court.
A federal injunction to stay state criminal proceedings is an extraor-
dinary remedy. Cf. Douglas v. City of Jeannette, 319 U.S. 157;
Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123. In addition to the considerations
normally attending an application for such relief, a serious question
of standing is presented on this motion, in that it appears that the
movants themselves are not being prosecuted in the Mississippi courts.
On the record before us the motion for a stay injunction pending
appeal is denied. Opinion per curiam. Mr. Justice Black and Mr.
Justice Frankfurter concur in the denial of a stay solely on the ground
that the three movants are not themselves being prosecuted or threat-
ened with prosecutions in Mississippi and they therefore reach no
other questions.
No. 325. Crest Finance Co., Inc., petitioner, v. United States. On

No. 714, Misc. William C. Coleman, petitioner, v. United States.
Petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals

and Mr. Justice Stewart are of the opinion that certiorari should be

No. 864, Misc. Leon Davis, petitioner, v. R. P. Balkcom, Jr.,
Warden. Petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of
Georgia denied. The Chief Justice, with whom Mr. Justice Douglas
joins, has filed the following memorandum:
While it is not our custom to state reasons when denying a writ
of certiorari, there are occasions when the gravity of the allegations
in a petition makes it appropriate to state what the denial does not
mean* in order to give assurance that this Court is not insensible to
charges of egregious violations of constitutional rights.
The denial of a writ of certiorari does not mean that this Court
approves the decision below nor, in state criminal cases, that the
petitioner is necessarily precluded from obtaining relief in some other
appropriate proceeding. Both state and federal courts have an
equally binding obligation to uphold the Constitution, and when a
state court fails to vindicate rights guaranteed by the Constitution
in a criminal proceeding upon a proper demand, the federal courts
are open to an aggrieved petitioner.
In this case the state courts refused to grant a hearing to the peti-
tioner on procedural grounds. However, a life is at stake, and unless
some court, state or federal, entertains his petition, this petitioner
will be executed without a hearing on charges that strike at the very
foundation of American justice. He contends that, under a statute re-
cently declared unconstitutional by this Court, he was denied the
right to be a witness in his own defense or even to testify that the
confession used against him was coerced during a two-month period
of illegal detention. He also claims that he was denied the right to
trial by jury of his peers under a valid indictment through the system-
atic exclusion of members of his race from the jury lists, a practice
which has often been condemned as unconstitutional by this Court
and which Congress has made criminal.
No man should ever be imprisoned-let alone executed-in this
country if such charges can be substantiated.

The Chief Justice said:
"With the concurrence of all my colleagues, I announce with regret
the retirement from this Court of Mr. Justice Whittaker, effective
April 1, 1962, in accordance with the provisions of Section 372 (a)
of Title 28, United States Code.
"In the past five years he has worked to the point of physical exhaus-

Court would seriously impair his health. He and we bow to the neces-
sity of the situation in the hope and expectation that complete rest
and relaxation will restore his vigor.
"Justice Whittaker leaves the Court with the affection of all his
colleagues, and I am sure with the satisfaction that flows from the
years of diligent and patriotic service he has given to the Nation.
"Our appreciation of that service and our friendship for him are
more adequately expressed in a letter to him in response to his letter
of retirement, both of which will be spread upon the Minutes of the
Court."
ORDER
It is ordered by the Court that the accompanying correspondence
between members of the Court and Mr. Justice Whittaker upon his
retirement as an Associate Justice of the Court be this day spread

This is in confirmation of my retirement from regular active service
as an Associate Justice of this Court, pursuant to the provisions of
Section 372 (a) of Title 28, United States Code, effective April 1, 1962.
I have taken this action with regret but in accordance with competent

I deeply appreciate the privilege which has been mine of serving

eight years, the last five as a member of this Court, to the best of my
ability. I also wish to express my most cordial regards and genuine
affection for every member of the Court with whom I have served
and to thank each of them and all members of the Court staff for uni-
formly courteous and helpful cooperation.
I will always be warmly interested in the welfare of every member
of the Court and shall endeavor in every way possible to serve its best
interest.

CHAMBERS OF
THE CHIEF JUSTICE
Honorable CHARLES E. WHITTAKER,
Associate Justice of the Supreme Court,
Washington, D. C.
DEAR JUSTICE WHITTAKER:
It is with the utmost reluctance that we bow to the necessity of
your retirement as an Associate Justice of this Court.
As you know, we had hoped it could have been otherwise, and that
to regain your strength you would permit us to absorb amongst our-
selves your work for the remainder of the Term. Your doctors have
decided that this would not be consistent with your future well-being,
that excessive work is responsible for your physical exhaustion, and
that only complete rest and relaxation can restore your vigor. We
submit, as you properly did, to that advice. In fairness to your
family, neither you nor we have the right to insist that you continue
to do that which would seriously impair your health.
Our five years of association with you have been in the finest tradi-
tions of the Court. No Justice could have worked harder or in more
complete harmony with his Brethren. We shall miss your kindly

MONDAY, APRIL 2, 1962
228
advice, but absence from our conference table cannot affect our attach-
ment to you. That we will retain always.
We wish for you a complete restoration of health and the many
years of happiness to which your conscientious service to your country
so justly entitles you.
Sincerely,
EARL WARREN

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Present: Mr. Chief Justice Warren, Mr. Justice Black, Mr. Justice
Douglas, Mr. Justice Clark, Mr. Justice Harlan, Mr. Justice Brennan,
Mr. Justice Stewart, and Mr. Justice White.
Mr. Solicitor General Cox addressed the Court as follows:
"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court: As the current
Term closes, Mr. Justice Black will have completed 25 full Terms
as an Associate Justice of this Court. This is a rare event in the
Court's history. Although it would be inappropriate to speak at
length, the members of the Bar would wish me to call attention to the
event and to mention Mr. Justice Black's extraordinarily great con-
tributions during those 25 Terms to the country, to the law, and to
the Court. May I add two other things on behalf of the entire Bar:
first, that we have always enjoyed, and will always value, the op-
portunity to appear before him and thus join in the common enter-
prise of administering justice for all; second, that we wish him health
and good fortune to serve for many Terms to come."
The Chief Justice said:
"Mr. Solicitor General:
"This is, indeed, a significant event in the life of the Court, and
it is highly appropriate that you, Mr. Solicitor General, as a leader
of the Bar, should initiate its recordation in today's proceedings.
"We share to the fullest extent your appreciation of the great
service Mr. Justice Black has rendered to our Nation, and we join
your felicitous words concerning his continued service and his future.
happiness.
“Of the 97 Justices who have been appointed to this Court, only
16 have served as long as Mr. Justice Black and none with greater
fidelity or singleness of purpose. His unflagging devotion has been
to the Constitution of the United States.
"The importance of any period of time depends always upon its
relation to other things. Abstractly, a quarter of a century in his-
tory is little more than a grain of sand in the hourglass of time,
but, measured in terms of the service of one man to the well-being of
a young and dynamic country such as our own, it is a long and im-
portant period of time.
"It is with such a measuring stick and with affectionate regard
that we measure and record in our proceedings the 25 years of service
of Mr. Justice Black to this Court and our Nation."

The Trading with the Enemy Act¹ authorizes the Government to
seize and confiscate under some circumstances the property of aliens.
By its denial of certiorari in this case the Court leaves standing a
judgment of confiscation 2 under circumstances which in my judgment
the Act does not authorize. I therefore feel impelled to dissent.
In May 1940 Hitler's forces, violating the historic neutrality of the
Netherlands, suddenly invaded that country, largely destroyed one of

its finest cities and within a short time occupied the whole country.
Although the United States soon recognized and allied itself with a
group of Royal Netherlands citizens who had escaped and set up an
independent government-in-exile in London,³ that occupation con-
tinued until May 1945 when troops from this country and its allies
finally managed to liberate the Netherlands from the German forces.
Within several weeks this country's ally, the free Netherlands govern-
ment, assumed lawful command of its own citizens and territory. It
was not, however, until some five and a half years later, long after
the end of the Nazi occupation and the return of the lawful govern-
ment of the Netherlands, that the Alien Property Custodian in 1951,
purportedly acting under the Trading With the Enemy Act, seized and
confiscated the four bank accounts in this country belonging to the
petitioning Dutch company which form the object of this lawsuit.
That confiscation of petitioner's property was sustained by the Court
of Appeals on the sole ground that the Netherlands, our friend and
ally, where petitioner was incorporated, had been overrun and oc-
cupied by Germany during the war. Because this result seems so con-
trary to the Purpose of Congress in passing the Trading With the
Enemy Act and raises such grave constitutional questions under the
Fifth Amendment's command that the Government not take private
property without paying just compensation, I think we should grant
certiorari to review the Court of Appeal's decision.
The Trading with the Enemy Act provides that the President may
seize "During the time of war" "any property in which any foreign
country or a national thereof has any interest." That Act also pro-
vides, however, that "Any person not an enemy or ally of enemy" may
sue to compel the return of his property. And even though the Act
defines an "enemy" as "Any individual, partnership, or other body of
individuals, of any nationality, resident within the territory (includ-
ing that occupied by the military and naval forces) of any nation with
which the United States is at war. . . and any corporation incor-
porated within such territory . . .," it does not say, as did the Court
of Appeals, that every corporation which was at any time present
within territory while that territory was occupied by an enemy is an
"enemy" within the meaning of the Act. I do not see how it can be
thought that Congress intended by this Act to authorize the confisca-
tion, between the end of actual occupation in 1945 and the official end
of the war in 1951,4 of every bit of property in this country owned by
the citizens and corporations of the Netherlands, France, Norway,
Belgium and other countries solely because those countries, our staunch

friends and allies, had during the war been overrun by an enemy
that was trying to destroy them and us. I can understand how Con-
gress might be thought to have desired to authorize the President to
seize the property of citizens and corporations of friendly countries.
and allies when those countries were at the time being occupied by an
enemy which might be able to use their property to carry on war
against us. I do not believe, however, that Congress intended to place
a permanent taint on the property of our friends so that whenever
that property showed up in this country it might be seized-even
though long after our friends' countries had been fortunate enough to
escape the occupation clutches of our common enemy. It would be
bad enough after the end of occupation to confiscate the property of
friendly aliens which had been in this country during the occupation
but to go beyond that and confiscate as here a bank account which did
not even exist in this country until 1948, three years after the return
of lawful government to the Netherlands, seems wholly contrary to
any purpose Congress could have had in the Act. Moreover, to con-
strue this statute this way raises serious questions about the con-
stitutionality of the Act as applied, for it has long been settled that
the provision of the Fifth Amendment requiring the payment of just
compensation when private property is taken for public use protects
friendly aliens as well as citizens. And it is obviously no answer
to this to say, as did the Court of Appeals, that the confiscation was
proper because this Government needed the property after the war
to support the cost of its past war efforts. Our constitutional guar-
antee against uncompensated government seizure of private property
surely does not melt away merely because public officials believe the
Government needs to seize property without paying for it.
This case would of course be far different if the Court of Appeals
had rested on the two other grounds urged by the Government below:
(1) that petitioner was "enemy-tainted," (2) and also that it was
engaged in doing business in Germany which was enemy territory.
But the Court of Appeals did not rest on either of these grounds
and we must accept the case as it comes to us or fail to accord petitioner
its full day in court. This is particularly true here, since the question
of enemy domination, if litigated, would have to be decided in light
of Kaufman v. Societe Internationale," where we held that innocent
stockholders even of enemy corporations must be protected from
having their property confiscated.
It is true that the refusal of the Court to grant certiorari in this
case gives no express approval to the interpretation of the Act made

by the Court of Appeals and leaves that question open for final author-
itative decision later. The Court's refusal to act now, however, does
leave standing the Court of Appeals' decision as a precedent in the
lower federal courts which will until reviewed here hang as a cloud
over the property rights in this country of citizens of foreign countries.
