tion for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Mississippi granted
limited to the following question: Whether the Mississippi Supreme
Court erred in how it applied Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79 (1986),
in this case.

                       Order in Pending Case
   No. 18A455. In Re Department of Commerce, et al., Applicants. Ap-
plication for stay presented to Justice Ginsburg and by her referred to
the Court denied. Justice Thomas, Justice Alito, and Justice Gorsuch
would grant the application.



                       Order in Pending Case
   No. 18A410. In Re United States, et al., Applicants. The Govern-
ment seeks a stay of proceedings in the District Court pending disposi-
tion of a petition for a writ of mandamus, No. 18–505, ordering dis-
missal of the suit. In such circumstances, a stay is warranted if there
is (1) “a fair prospect that a majority of the Court will vote to grant
mandamus,” and (2) “a likelihood that irreparable harm will result from
the denial of a stay.” Hollingsworth v. Perry, 558 U. S. 183, 190 (2010)
(per curiam). Mandamus may issue when “(1) `no other adequate
means [exist] to attain the relief [the party] desires,' (2) the party's
`right to issuance of the writ is clear and indisputable,' and (3) `the
writ is appropriate under the circumstances.' ” Ibid. (quoting Cheney
v. United States Dist. Court for D. C., 542 U. S. 367, 380–381 (2004)).
“The traditional use of the writ in aid of appellate jurisdiction . . . has
been to confne [the court against which mandamus is sought] to a law-
ful exercise of its prescribed jurisdiction.” Id. at 380 (quoting Roche v.
Evaporated Milk Assn., 319 U. S. 21, 26 (1943)).
   The Government contends that these standards are satisfed here
because the litigation is beyond the limits of Article III. The Govern-
ment notes that the suit is based on an assortment of unprecedented
legal theories, such as a substantive due process right to certain cli-
mate conditions, and an equal protection right to live in the same cli-
mate as enjoyed by prior generations. The Government further points
out that plaintiffs ask the District Court to create a “national remedial
plan” to stabilize the climate and “restore the Earth's energy balance.”
   The District Court denied the Government's dispositive mo-
tions, stating that “[t]his action is of a different order than the typical
environmental case. It alleges that defendants' actions and inactions—
                         FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 2, 2018                     235
whether or not they violate any specifc statutory duty—have so pro-
foundly damaged our home planet that they threaten plaintiffs' funda-
mental constitutional rights to life and liberty.” Juliana v. United
States, 217 F. Supp. 3d 1224, 1261 (Ore. 2016). The District Court de-
clined to certify its orders for interlocutory review under 28 U. S. C.
§ 1292(b) (permitting such review when the district court certifes that
its order “involves a controlling question of law as to which there is
substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate ap-
peal . . . may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litiga-
tion”). See this Court's order of July 30, 2018, No. 18A65 (noting that
the “striking” breadth of plaintiffs' below claims “presents substantial
grounds for difference of opinion”).
   At this time, however, the Government's petition for a writ of manda-
mus does not have a “fair prospect” of success in this Court because
adequate relief may be available in the United States Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit. When mandamus relief is available in the court
of appeals, pursuit of that option is ordinarily required. See S. Ct. Rule
20.1 (petitioners seeking extraordinary writ must show “that adequate
relief cannot be obtained in any other form or from any other court”
(emphasis added)); S. Ct. Rule 20.3 (mandamus petition must “set out
with particularity why the relief sought is not available in any other
court”); see also Ex parte Peru, 318 U. S. 578, 585 (1943) (mandamus
petition “ordinarily must be made to the intermediate appellate
court”).
   Although the Ninth Circuit has twice denied the Government's re-
quest for mandamus relief, it did so without prejudice. And the court's
basis for denying relief rested, in large part, on the early stage of the
litigation, the likelihood that plaintiffs' claims would narrow as the case
progressed, and the possibility of attaining relief through ordinary dis-
positive motions. Those reasons are, to a large extent, no longer perti-
nent. The 50–day trial was scheduled to begin on October 29, 2018, and
is being held in abeyance only because of the current administrative
stay.
   In light of the foregoing, the application for stay, presented to The
Chief Justice and by him referred to the Court, is denied without prej-
udice. The order heretofore entered by The Chief Justice is vacated.
   Justice Thomas and Justice Gorsuch would grant the application.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

  Present: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Thomas, Justice Ginsburg,
Justice Breyer, Justice Alito, Justice Sotomayor, Justice Kagan, Justice
Gorsuch, and Justice Kavanaugh.
   The Chief Justice said:
   “We have issued orders today, they have been duly entered and certi-
fed, and fled with the Clerk.
   “The Court notes with sadness the death of former President George
H. W. Bush on November 30, 2018. In observance of the national day
of mourning, the Court will not sit on Wednesday, December 5th.
   “Before we commence this morning's business, I would like to ac-
knowledge the presence in the courtroom of Justice Anthony M. Ken-
nedy, and I would like to read into the records of the Court an exchange
of correspondence.
   “The frst letter is dated today, December 3, 2018. It is to Justice
Kennedy from my colleagues and me, and it reads as follows:
   “Dear Tony, Although our new Term is well underway, we remain
keenly aware of your absence on the Bench and in our Conference.
From the time each of us came to know you, you have enriched our
lives through your kindness, comradery, and generosity. We are heart-
ened that you have maintained an active presence in the building, and
we take great comfort that you remain our valued colleague here. No
one leaves Sacramento to become a prospector. But your labors since
moving east have yielded a treasure of thoughtful decisions. This leg-
acy will guide the understanding of judges, lawyers, and citizens for
years to come. Your example of ceaseless civility inspires us as we go
forward with the work of the Court that you have so vitally advanced.
We wish you and Mary well in your much-deserved retirement, and we
look forward to many more years in this new chapter of our shared
friendships. Affectionately, and it is signed by all members of the Court
as well as the retired Justices.
   “The next letter is to myself and the colleagues on the bench and it
is from Justice Kennedy. It reads:
   “Dear Chief Justice and Dear Colleagues, Please accept this expres-
sion of deepest appreciation for the uplifting words and sentiments in
your most gracious letter. It will be treasured by our family. This reply
is not to say farewell, for it is my hope to linger here to be with all of
you in the days and years to come. It is necessary, of course, to say
304                      MONDAY, DECEMBER 3, 2018

farewell to being on the bench and in the conference room. There, for
the past thirty years, it was a high honor to join with our colleagues
in seeking how best to defne and interpret an idea and a reality—the
idea and the reality of the law.
  “Even if we disagreed in a particular case, we admired and respected
each other as we sought to explain the law as we found it to be and to
ensure that, over the course of time, the law and the freedoms it sus-
tains will be ever more secure, ever more revered. We frst came to
Washington knowing few who lived here, but the members of the Court
at once reached out to Mary and me with gifts of guidance, understand-
ing, and above all, the priceless bond of friendship. It seems proper to
quote from the poet and to say that for all these gifts, `I can no other
answer make but thanks, and thanks, and ever thanks.' With assur-
ances of my continued highest regards, I remain, Yours sincerely,
Tony.”

  Present: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Thomas, Justice Ginsburg,
Justice Breyer, Justice Alito, Justice Sotomayor, Justice Kagan, Justice
Gorsuch, and Justice Kavanaugh.
   The Chief Justice said:

fessionalism of all the Court staff contribute signifcantly to the accom-
plishment of the Court's mission.
   “The Court also thanks the members of the Court's bar for their
professionalism and cooperation.
   “Before we rise for the summer, I would like to note the retirement
of three Court employees. Private First Class Tracy Anderson retired
on September 29, 2018. Offcer Anderson served with distinction and
retires with 28 years of outstanding service on the Supreme Court
police force. Private First Class Edwin Haynes retired on December
31, 2018. We are grateful to Offcer Haynes for his 25 years of valuable
service on the Supreme Court police force. Research librarian Cather-
ine Romano retired on April 30, 2019, with 34 years of Supreme Court
service; tying John Marshall's record. We are grateful for her many
years of hard work and dedication to the Court. Mr. Anderson,
Mr. Haynes, and Ms. Romano, the Court thanks each of you for your
service, and we wish you well in your retirement!”

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

  Present: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Thomas, Justice Ginsburg,
Justice Breyer, Justice Alito, Justice Sotomayor, Justice Kagan, Justice
Gorsuch, and Justice Kavanaugh.

                       Order in Pending Case
   No. 19A60. Donald J. Trump, President of the United States, et al.,
Applicants v. Sierra Club, et al. Application for stay presented to Jus-
tice Kagan and by her referred to the Court granted. Among the rea-
sons is that the Government has made a suffcient showing at this stage
that the plaintiffs have no cause of action to obtain review of the Acting
Secretary's compliance with Section 8005. The District Court's June 28,
2019 order granting a permanent injunction is stayed pending disposi-
tion of the Government's appeal in the United States Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit and disposition of the Government's petition for
a writ of certiorari, if such writ is timely sought. Should the petition
for a writ of certiorari be denied, this stay shall terminate automati-
cally. In the event the petition for a writ of certiorari is granted, the
stay shall terminate when the Court enters its judgment.
   Justice Ginsburg, Justice Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan would deny
the application.
   Justice Breyer, concurring in part and dissenting in part from grant
of stay.
