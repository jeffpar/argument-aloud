No. 868. William A. Lawrence, petitioner, v. The State of Ari-

State of Arizona. Per curiam: This is a petition for a writ of
certiorari to the Supreme Court of Arizona to review the validity
of a judgment of that court affirming the judgment of the Superior
Court of Maricopa County of that State sentencing the petitioner
to death for the crime of murder. There is also a motion by peti-
tioner to be allowed to proceed in this court in forma pauperis
and for a stay of the sentence which by its terms is to be executed
on January 8th next. We have considered the petition, and all the
papers accompanying it, and the brief of counsel for the petitioner
setting forth the grounds upon which it is claimed that this court
should take jurisdiction of the cause. After full examination we
find that there is no Federal question disclosed upon which we prop-
erly could grant the writ of certiorari and review the case. The
petition for certiorari is therefore denied, and so also of course
are the motions for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and for a
stay of the sentence. The clerk will issue certificate of our action
forthwith to the clerk of the Supreme Court of Arizona, and in
addition will advise by telegram the Governor of Arizona, the clerk
of its Supreme Court, and the counsel for the petitioner.
