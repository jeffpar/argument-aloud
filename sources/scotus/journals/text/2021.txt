and fled with the Clerk.
  “Before we begin, I would like to note that today marks the 30th

the Bench and repeated the judicial oath, administered by Chief Justice
Rehnquist. On behalf of the Court, I would like to extend to Justice
Thomas our heartfelt congratulations on what is for all of us a very
happy anniversary.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

   Present: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Thomas, Justice Breyer, Jus-
tice Alito, Justice Sotomayor, Justice Kagan, Justice Gorsuch, Justice
Kavanaugh, and Justice Barrett.
   The Chief Justice said:
   “Justice Sotomayor is participating remotely this morning.”

                         Oral Arguments
  No. 21–12. Federal Election Commission, Appellant v. Ted Cruz for
Senate, et al. Argued by Mr. Deputy Solicitor General Malcolm L.
Stewart for the appellant and by Mr. Charles J. Cooper for the
respondents.
  No. 20–1650. Carlos Concepcion, Petitioner v. United States. Argued

                      Order in Pending Case
   No. 21A272. Donald J. Trump, former President of the United
States, Applicant v. Bennie G. Thompson, in His Offcial Capacity as
Chairman of the United States House Select Committee to Investigate
the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol, et al. On applica-
tion for stay of mandate and injunction pending review. Application for
stay of mandate and injunction pending review presented to The Chief
Justice and by him referred to the Court denied. The questions
whether and in what circumstances a former President may obtain a
court order preventing disclosure of privileged records from his tenure
in offce, in the face of a determination by the incumbent President to
waive the privilege, are unprecedented and raise serious and substan-
tial concerns. The Court of Appeals, however, had no occasion to decide
these questions because it analyzed and rejected President Trump's
privilege claims “under any of the tests [he] advocated,” Trump v.
Thompson, 20 F. 4th 10, 33 (CADC 2021), without regard to his status
as a former President, id., at 40–46. Because the Court of Appeals
348                    WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 19, 2022

concluded that President Trump's claims would have failed even if he
were the incumbent, his status as a former President necessarily made
no difference to the court's decision. Id., at 33 (noting no “need [to]
conclusively resolve whether and to what extent a court,” at a former
President's behest, may “second guess the sitting President's” decision
to release privileged documents); see also id., at 17, n. 2. Any discussion
of the Court of Appeals concerning President Trump's status as a for-
mer President must therefore be regarded as nonbinding dicta. Justice
Thomas would grant the application. Statement of Justice Kavanaugh
respecting denial of application.

   No. 21A375 (21–1086). John H. Merrill, Alabama Secretary of
State, et al., Applicants v. Evan Milligan, et al.; and
   No. 21A376 (21–1087). John H. Merrill, Alabama Secretary of
State, et al., Applicants v. Marcus Caster, et al. The application for a
stay or injunctive relief presented to Justice Thomas and by him re-
ferred to the Court in No. 21A375 is treated as a jurisdictional state-
ment, and probable jurisdiction is noted. The application for a stay or
injunctive relief presented to Justice Thomas and by him referred to
the Court in No. 21A376 is treated as a petition for writ of certiorari
before judgment. Respondents in No. 21A376 do not oppose treating
the application as a petition for a writ of certiorari before judgment
and do not oppose granting the petition (although they do oppose
granting a stay). With that fact taken into account, the petition is
granted. The district court's January 24, 2022 preliminary injunctions
in No. 2:21–cv–1530 and No. 2:21–cv–1536 are stayed pending further
order of the Court.
   Justice Kavanaugh, with whom Justice Alito joins, concurring in
grant of applications for stays.
   The Chief Justice, dissenting from grant of applications for stays.
   Justice Kagan, with whom Justice Breyer and Justice Sotomayor
join, dissenting from grant of applications for stays.

                      Orders in Pending Cases
   No. 20–1410. Xiulu Ruan, Petitioner v. United States; and

Plan, et al., Petitioners v. Davita Inc., et al. Motion of the Solicitor
General for leave to participate in oral argument as amicus curiae, for

granted.
   No. 21–147. Erik Egbert, Petitioner v. Robert Boule. Motion for
leave to fle respondent's brief on the merits under seal with redacted
copies for the public record granted. Motion of the Solicitor General
for leave to participate in oral argument as amicus curiae, for divided
argument, and for enlargement of time for oral argument granted.

                         Certiorari Granted
  No. 21–954. Joseph R. Biden, Jr., President of the United States,
et al., Petitioners v. Texas, et al. Petition for writ of certiorari to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit granted. The case
will be set for argument in the second week of the April 2022 argument
session. Petitioners' brief on the merits is to be fled on or before Mon-
day, March 14, 2022. Respondents' brief on the merits is to be fled on
or before Thursday, April 7, 2022. The reply brief is to be fled with
the Clerk and served upon opposing counsel on or before 2 p.m.,

                       Order in Pending Case
  No. 21A217. John Doe, et al., Applicants v. San Diego Unifed School
District, et al. Application for injunctive relief presented to Justice
376                    FRIDAY, FEBRUARY 18, 2022

Kagan and by her referred to the Court denied in light of changed
circumstances. Because respondents have delayed implementation of
the challenged policy, and because they have not settled on the form
any policy will now take, emergency relief is not warranted at this
time. Applicants' alternative request for a writ of certiorari before
judgment and a stay pending resolution is denied for the same reason.
The Court's denial is without prejudice to applicants seeking a new
injunction if circumstances warrant.

tice Alito, Justice Sotomayor, Justice Kagan, Justice Gorsuch, Justice

                          Oral Argument
   No. 21–429. Oklahoma, Petitioner v. Victor Manuel Castro-Huerta.
Argued by Mr. Kannon Shanmugam for the petitioner, by Mr. Zachary
C. Schauf for the respondent, and by Mr. Deputy Solicitor General
Edwin S. Kneedler for the United States as amicus curiae, by special
leave of the Court, in support of the respondent.
   The Chief Justice said:
   “Mr. Kneedler, I note for the record that this is the 150th case in
which you have presented oral argument before the Court. And on
behalf of the Court, I thank you for your skilled advocacy over the
years.
   “As you may have heard, Justice Breyer has announced his retire-
ment from the Court, effective when we rise for the summer recess.
That means that the oral argument we have just concluded is the last
the Court will hear with Justice Breyer on the Bench.
   “For 28 years this has been his arena for remarks profound and mov-
ing, questions challenging and insightful, and hypotheticals downright
silly. This sitting alone has brought us radioactive muskrats and John
the Tiger Man.
   “At the appropriate time, we will in accordance with tradition and
practice read and enter into the record an exchange of letters between
the Court and Justice Breyer marking his retirement.
   “For now, we leave the Courtroom with deep appreciation for the
privilege of sharing this Bench with him.”


  Adjourned until Monday, May 2, 2022, at 10 o'clock.

for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Missouri denied.


   The Chief Justice said:
   “The Court is in Special Session this afternoon to receive the resolu-
tions of the Bar of the Supreme Court in tribute to Justice John Paul
Stevens. The Court recognizes the Solicitor General.”
  The Solicitor General said:
  “Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
  “At a meeting today of the Bar of this Court, resolutions memorializ-
ing our deep respect and affection for Justice John Paul Stevens were
adopted unanimously.
  “Today, the Bar of this Court gathers to pay tribute to Justice Ste-
vens, a model of integrity, independence, and intellectual honesty, who
served the nation for 35 years as an Associate Justice of this Court.
  “Justice Stevens was a lawyer of the highest quality and a human
being of the highest character. He was gifted with an agile and curious
mind, and he used it well, writing more than 1,000 Supreme Court
opinions, three books, and countless articles. He was a patriot with a
profound infectious sense of optimism. Yet, his eyes stayed clear, and
his pragmatism never waned. Independent to the core and thoroughly
decent, Justice Stevens lived a life dedicated to the rule of law and to
equal justice under it.
  “John Paul Stevens was born in 1920 in Chicago's Hyde Park neigh-
borhood. For college, he enrolled at the University of Chicago to study
English literature. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa with the university's
highest honors.
  “Justice Stevens served as a Naval offcer during World War II. He
spent much of the war stationed at Pearl Harbor, working as an intelli-
                            MONDAY, MAY 2, 2022                       583
gence offcer breaking Japanese codes. He was awarded the Bronze
Star for his service.
   “After the war, Justice Stevens enrolled in Northwestern University
School of Law. Northwestern's emphasis on facts, context, and proce-
dure, rather than legal rules alone, had a lasting effect on his thinking.
He often quoted his professor's advice: `Beware of glittering generali-
ties.' Justice Stevens became Co-Editor-in-Chief of Northwestern's
Law Review and graduated frst in his class with the highest grades
to date in the school's history. His brilliant record earned him a Su-
preme Court clerkship with Justice Wiley Rutledge during the 1947
Term.
  “Following his clerkship, Justice Stevens returned to Chicago and
soon distinguished himself as a leading antitrust litigator. He argued a
case before this Court and taught antitrust law at both Northwestern
and the University of Chicago.
  “Public service formed a cornerstone of his years practicing law. He
served as associate counsel to a House Judiciary subcommittee study-
ing monopoly power. He also served as counsel to a special commission
convened to investigate charges of corruption leveled at the Illinois
Supreme Court. And he generously accepted pro bono appointments,
including a case where he persuaded the Illinois Supreme Court to
reverse a conviction procured by beating a defendant until he con-
fessed. That and other experiences infuenced his insistence that crimi-
nal defendants receive full and fair trials and appeals.
  “In 1970, President Nixon nominated Justice Stevens to the Seventh
Circuit, where he served for the next fve years. In 1975, President
Ford nominated him to this Court. Justice Stevens was confrmed by a
vote of 98 to zero just 19 days after his nomination.
   “President Ford chose Justice Stevens for his integrity and his excel-
lence. Plain-spoken and direct, Justice Stevens avoided one-size-fts-all
solutions to complex legal problems. He instead grounded his approach
in the facts, in our constitutional tradition, and in careful consideration
of precedent, context, and common sense.
  “His commitment to the rule of law was second to none, and for
him, that meant the conscientious exercise of independent judgment.
Indeed, over more than three decades on the Court, Justice Stevens
fearlessly exercised independent judgment across myriad areas of the
law, too many to recount here. For example, early in his tenure on the
Court, he declared his independence from the orthodoxy of different
584                         MONDAY, MAY 2, 2022

tiers of scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause, writing that the
clause does not make some groups of citizens more equal than others.
   “His independence wasn't limited to constitutional law. In the realm
of statutory interpretation, he rejected what he called a purely literal
approach and refused to wear, in his words, `thick grammarian specta-
cles.' He didn't ignore the words of statutes. Many of his opinions en-
gaged in close analysis of the specifc statutory terms and structure,
but he also sought guidance from context, legislative history, and the
purpose behind the legislation. He stood by that approach to the end,
defending attention to legislative history against textualist critics even
after he retired from the Court.
   “Justice Stevens viewed the courts as a refuge for the powerless.
His unwavering commitment to procedural regularity took center
stage when he authored the Court's opinion holding that the federal
habeas statute applies to detainees held in Guantánamo Bay after
9/11. That opinion vindicated the core insight of Justice Rutledge's dis-
senting opinion from 56 years earlier in Ahrens v. Clark, an opinion
decided during Justice Stevens' tenure as a law clerk.
  “Decency, independence, and humble brilliance ran through Justice
Stevens' work. He was kind, gracious, quick to smile, and unfailingly
polite. At oral argument, he usually prefaced his questions with a dis-
arming, `May I ask you this?' His clerks adored him, describing him as
the best boss they could ever hope to have.
   “To prepare for oral argument, he didn't ask his clerks for bench
memos. Instead, after he read all the papers, he would stroll into the
clerks' offce and settle into a well-worn armchair. He would talk
through cases there, aided by his near-perfect recall of earlier
precedents.
   “And when he had an opinion to write, he always prepared the frst
draft himself. Many of these drafts were separate opinions. Indeed, he
wrote more dissents than any other Justice in this Court's history and
more concurring opinions too. With his fearless independence, he was
untroubled by being one against eight, although he wished his col-
leagues would rethink their votes.
   “Most of his dissents remain dissents, enduring markers of how Jus-
tice Stevens believed we could achieve a more just society. But they
sometimes paved the way for future change. Justice Stevens dissented
in Bowers v. Hardwick, writing that individual decisions about inti-
mate relationships are a form of liberty protected by the Due Process
Clause.
                            MONDAY, MAY 2, 2022                        585
   “Seventeen years later, Justice Stevens assigned Justice Kennedy to
write the Court's opinion in Lawrence v. Texas, overruling Bowers.
The opinion stated: `Justice Stevens' analysis in our view should have
been controlling in Bowers and should control here.'
   “Justice Stevens dedicated himself to a lifetime of learning. Intellec-
tual curiosity and openness were, in his view, essential virtues of any
good judge. Through it all, he remained true to his own incremental
and nonideological vision of judging. On the 30th anniversary of his
appointment, President Ford put it just right, saying: `He has served
his nation well, at all times carrying out his judicial duties with dignity,
intellect, and without partisan political concern. Justice Stevens has
made me and our nation and our fellow citizens proud.'
   “Gathered here together, looking back at his extraordinary life, the
members of the Bar of this Court express our great admiration and
respect for Justice John Paul Stevens, our deep sense of loss upon his
death, our appreciation for his contribution to the law, to the Court,
and to the nation, and our gratitude for an example of a life well spent.
   “On behalf of the Bar of the Supreme Court, it is my privilege to
present to the Court the resolutions adopted today so that the Attor-
ney General may move their inscription on the Court's permanent
record.”
   The Chief Justice said:
   “Thank you, General Prelogar. I recognize the Attorney General of
the United States.”
   The Attorney General said:
   “Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
   “Actually, I do not think that traditional prayer is necessary today
because I am pretty sure that the request I will be making at the end
of these remarks will please the Court.
   “The Bar of the Court met today to honor the memory of John Paul
Stevens, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court from 1975 to 2010.
Justice Stevens was humble, curious, and generous both as a judge and
as a human being.
   “He exemplifed open-mindedness, collegiality, and integrity. He was
unfailingly well prepared, civil, and intellectually formidable on every
case he heard. He modeled the best of the judicial craft and was a
proud and tireless guardian of judicial independence.
   “Justice Stevens was born on April 20, 1920, in Chicago. He attended
the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools for elementary and high
school and then the University of Chicago for college.
586                        MONDAY, MAY 2, 2022

  “Justice Stevens graduated in 1941 and had begun work on a Mas-
ter's degree in English when his dean asked him to consider crypto-
graphic work for the Navy. He took the suggestion to heart, and he
was commissioned as a Naval offcer.
  “In his distinguished Navy career, Justice Stevens helped crack
codes with important consequences for the war effort. He did this
through his knack for seeing angles in problems that others had missed,
an ability that would be recognized throughout his subsequent career.
  “When he left the service, Justice Stevens pursued law school at the
suggestion of his brother. At Northwestern, he became Co-Editor-in-
Chief of the Law Review and graduated frst in his class. His outstand-
ing performance and a lucky coin fip with a classmate won him a clerk-
ship with Justice Wiley B. Rutledge.
  “Upon completion of the 1947 Term, Justice Rutledge gave Justice
Stevens a photo inscribed `To my friend and former clerk with appreci-
ation and affection.' Years later, Justice Stevens made a practice of
inscribing photos to his own clerks in the same way.
  “After his clerkship, Justice Stevens returned home to Chicago. He
became a leading litigator in private practice and argued a case in this
Court. He specialized in antitrust law, a subject he also taught as an
adjunct professor of law at Northwestern and at the University of
Chicago.
  “He accepted important opportunities for public service, including as
an advisor on the Attorney General's Advisory Committee on the anti-
trust laws and as a counsel to a special commission to investigate
charges of corruption in the Illinois Supreme Court.
  “He took cases pro bono, including a criminal matter in which he
won reversal of his client's murder conviction premised on a coerced
confession.
  “In 1970, he became a judge of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the
Seventh Circuit, and then, in 1975, President Gerald R. Ford appointed
him to the Supreme Court of the United States.
  “My distinguished predecessor, Attorney General Edward Levi,
called Stevens, `a craftsman of the highest order whose opinions were
gems of perfection.'
  “In 2005, former President Ford refected on the appointment with
pride, writing of his own presidency, `I am prepared to allow history's
judgment of my term in offce to rest, if necessary, exclusively on my
nomination 30 years ago of Justice John Paul Stevens to the U. S. Su-
preme Court.'
                            MONDAY, MAY 2, 2022                      587
   “As a member of this Court, Justice Stevens was independent, in-
sightful, and prolifc. His vast body of opinions touched almost every
corner of federal law. It would be impossible to do justice to that re-
markable body of judicial work in these brief remarks, so I will limit
myself to just a few examples.
  “In the realm of criminal law, Justice Stevens' landmark opinion in
Apprendi v. New Jersey was the frst in a line of cases that transformed
the law of sentencing, a line that also included Justice Stevens' opinions
in United States v. Booker and Gall v. United States.
   “His opinions in INS v. St. Cyr, Rasul v. Bush, and Hamdan v. Rum-
sfeld protected the writ of habeas corpus as a means of testing the
legality of executive decisions.
  “His opinion in Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council,
holding that courts must defer to reasonable agency interpretations of
ambiguous statutes, has chartered the course of administrative law for
a generation.
   “And in antitrust law, his frst love, his infuential opinions in cases
like NCAA v. Board of Regents and American Needle v. NFL have
guided the principles governing horizontal restraints adopted by asso-
ciations and joint ventures.
  “Justice Stevens' time on the Court was defned not only by what he
contributed to the law but by how he did so. He was kind and unassum-
ing without any airs. He would often preface his questions from the
bench with, `May I ask you a question?'
  “He was a warm colleague both on and off the Bench. The affection
that his fellow Justices felt for him was manifest. He also made good
on the words he inscribed on the photos he gave his law clerks. They
were both his former clerks and his friends.
  “I frst met the Justice just a few years after he came on the Court.
As a new clerk for Justice Brennan, I dropped by the Stevens Cham-
bers to talk with his clerks about a case. When he heard us talking in
the clerks' room, the Justice came in, plopped himself down in an easy
chair and immediately entered into the conversation.
  “It was clear that he loved the give and take of the conversation. It
was clear that this kind of discussion was central to the way he made
up his mind about cases. It was very clear that even though he was
very attentive to what we thought, the fnal decision would be his
based on his own independent judgment. And it was also very clear
that his clerks loved being part of that process.
588                        MONDAY, MAY 2, 2022

   “For a moment, I was jealous of the fact that he had hired only two
clerks who had undoubtedly become closer to their Justice than the
rest of us in chambers with twice that many, but then I remembered,
because they were not in the cert. pool, those two clerks would be
working on every single cert. petition.
   “But, while he was a congenial colleague and boss, Justice Stevens
was also fearless in going it alone, whether piloting small airplanes,
disputing that William Shakespeare actually wrote the Shakespeare
plays, rooting for the Cubs as a south-sider, writing the frst drafts of
his opinions, or concurring or dissenting solo when his views departed
from those of other Justices.
   “He placed a premium on exercising independent judgment and was
insistent on explaining the legal reasoning underlying that judgment.
He also believed that it was important to change your mind when you
concluded that your original position was wrong or even if one of your
published opinions was wrong.
   “As he put it just a few years before his retirement, `Learning on
the bench has been one of the most important and rewarding aspects
of my own experience over the last 35 years.'
   “Justice Stevens embodied the independence and commitment to jud-
ging each case on its own merits. That is essential to the rule of law.
   “When Justice Stevens retired from the Court at age 90, he had been
working long after most people his age had retired. Yet he appeared
to have become younger each year he sat on the bench. In the words
of President Obama, he retired `at the top of his game.' Not that he
really retired in any conventional sense. In the years after leaving the
Court, he published three books, including `The Making of a Justice:
Refections on My First 94 Years.'
   “Although he traded tennis for ping-pong and acceded to his family's
wishes that he stop swimming in the open ocean on his own, he kept
up the kind of pace that made many believe there might well be a
second 94 years.
   “In his last days, he few to Portugal to participate in a conference.
His travel companions reported he hadn't lost a step. At the time of
his passing in 2019, Justice Stevens had been retired from active serv-
ice for nearly a decade and yet, in the words of Justice David Souter,
he remained `the soul of principle and an irreplaceable friend.'
   “Justice Stevens will long be remembered for his extraordinary serv-
ice to our country, for his commitment to the rule of law, for his funda-
mental decency, and for the integrity with which he worked and lived.

  “Mr. Chief Justice, on behalf of the lawyers of this nation and in
particular the members of this Court's Bar, I respectfully request that
the resolutions presented to you in honor of John Paul Stevens be ac-
cepted by the Court and that together with the chronicle of these pro-
ceedings, they be ordered be kept for all time in the records of this
Court.”
   The Chief Justice said:
   “Thank you, General Garland, General Prelogar, for your presenta-
tions in memory of Justice John Paul Stevens. We also extend our ap-
preciation for the resolutions you have read today to Co-Chairs Jamal
Greene and Carol Lee and members of the Committee on Resolutions
and to Co-Chairs David Barron and Teresa Wynn Roseborough and the
members of the Arrangements Committee.
  “Your motion that they be made part of the permanent record of the
Court is granted.
   “As you've heard, John Paul Stevens was nominated to the offce of
United States Circuit Judge for the Seventh Circuit by President Rich-
ard M. Nixon on September 22, 1970. And just fve years later, Presi-
dent Gerald Ford nominated him to be the 101st member of this Court.
As Justice Stevens often noted, his appearance before the Senate Judi-
ciary Committee marked the last untelevised confrmation hearing for
a Supreme Court nominee. The Senate confrmed him unanimously, and
he took his seat on December 19, 1975.
  “He led an extraordinary life of exemplary service to our country.
He was born in Chicago. In the year he was born, Woodrow Wilson
was president, and Prohibition had just become the law of the land.
William Howard Taft had not yet become Chief Justice, and the Su-
preme Court did not yet have a building of its own. Young John's par-
ents ensured that he had an extraordinary upbringing. In 1927, he met
both Amelia Earhart and Charles Lindbergh at the grand opening of
the Stevens Hotel launched by his family in Chicago. Perhaps those
encounters infuenced his enthusiasm for aviation.
   “Although he grew up in a steadfastly Republican family, his father
took John to see President Franklin Roosevelt's acceptance speech on
the last day of the Democratic Party's convention in 1932, at which
FDR frst used the term `New Deal.' FDR was just the frst of many
presidents John Paul Stevens encountered personally. Eighty years
later, in another memorable encounter, President Barack Obama
awarded Justice Stevens the Presidential Medal of Freedom, citing his
`clear and graceful manner in the defense of individual rights and the
590                        MONDAY, MAY 2, 2022

rule of law always favoring a pragmatic solution over an ideological
one.'
   “Among other memorable encounters with persons of note, John was
in attendance at Wrigley Field when Babe Ruth made his famous
`called shot' home run. A life-long Cubs fan, he proudly displayed the
box score from that game in his offce. In 2006, he became the frst
Supreme Court Justice to step on the mound at Wrigley Field and
throw out the frst pitch at a Cubs game. He threw a strike. He called
that the high point of his career.
  “But there were, to say the least, other impressive accomplishments.
He attended the University of Chicago and, upon graduation in 1941,
enrolled, you've heard, in a secret program for cryptographic work in
the United States Navy. Stationed in Oahu, Lieutenant Commander
Stevens was part of a team of signal offcers that cracked Japanese
codes and hastened the end of the war.
  “After that, he chose to study at Northwestern Law, both for its
excellence and because of the opportunity it offered to complete three
years of law study in two years. He became Co-Editor-in-Chief of the
Law Review and earned record grades. He paid for his legal education
through the GI Bill, and it proved to be an outstanding investment
both for Stevens and for the country.
  “John Paul Stevens came to the Supreme Court as a law clerk for
Wiley Rutledge, and among the cases decided by the Court that Term
was Ahrens against Clark, a challenge to postwar deportation brought
by German prisoners detained on Ellis Island. Justice Rutledge dis-
sented from an opinion limiting the writ of habeas corpus. In 2004, then
Justice Stevens relied on the Rutledge dissent when writing for the
Court in Rasul v. Bush, which found that federal courts were not
barred from reviewing the constitutionality of detention of terrorists
at Guantánamo Bay.
  “He was always confdent that a judge's job was simply to articulate
the best way to decide each case. And when in dissent, he never seemed
to doubt that the Court would eventually see things his way.
  “Following his clerkship, John Paul Stevens returned to practice in
Chicago. He initially joined the frm that is now known as Jenner &
Block, where he developed a specialized interest in antitrust law. His
focus on that feld led to his appointment as an associate counsel to the
Subcommittee on the Study of Monopoly Power of the House Commit-
tee on the Judiciary.
                           MONDAY, MAY 2, 2022                      591
   “In 1952, he co-founded his own law frm. He devoted his time and
considerable energy to various public service and pro bono work, ob-
serving later that most good lawyers devote a signifcant amount of
time to public service for which they receive no pay.
   “After 18 years in private practice, John Paul Stevens began his
career of distinguished service to the judiciary. In nearly 35 years on
this Court, Justice Stevens wrote 400 majority and plurality opinions
for the Court, beginning with Mathews v. Diaz in 1976. On a few occa-
sions, 1,415 to be precise, he wrote a concurring or dissenting opinion
or separate statement.
   “In this courtroom, Justice Stevens was universally polite and prob-
ing. He consistently asked questions that illuminated aspects of the
case others had not spotted. Indeed, Justice Stevens' penetrating per-
ception extended even to matters of civility and grace. In 1980, before
Sandra Day O'Connor joined the Court, he was a catalyst for dropping
the traditional salutation of `Mr. Justice' in favor of simply `Justice.'
When he retired in 2010, he noted with satisfaction that a letter written
to the other Justices when he joined the Court would have been ad-
dressed `Dear Brethren,' but he would begin `Dear Colleagues.'
   “He did it all with a smile, an even keel, and a warm generosity, not
just to those with life tenure or learned in the law but to all people he
encountered. His service would be noteworthy alone for its length, the
third longest tenure in the Court's history and just a few months shy
of the record. But he will remain an enduring inspiration to everyone
associated with this Court because he served so well and with such a
spirit of decency and kindness.
   “John Paul Stevens said that he hoped his legacy would be to be
remembered as an honest judge and a good judge who tried to reach
the best result in every case. Perhaps he would have welcomed our
affrmation of that sentiment to be the last word today. But I hope he
would not mind a concurring opinion from the members of the Court
and the members of the Bar of this Court that this one-of-a-kind Amer-
ican will long be remembered for his extraordinary patriotism, human-
ity, and contributions to the rule of law.”

  No. 21–1596 (21A814). Kyle Ardoin, Louisiana Secretary of State,

treated as a petition for writ of certiorari before judgment, and the
petition is granted. The case is held in abeyance pending this Court's
decision in Merrill, AL Sec. of State, et al. v. Milligan, Evan, et al.
(No. 21-1086 and No. 21-1087) or further order of the Court. The stay
shall terminate upon the sending down of the judgment of this Court.
  Justice Breyer, Justice Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan would deny the
application for stay and dissent from the treatment of the application
as a petition for writ of certiorari before judgment and the granting of
certiorari before judgment.

                       Order in Pending Case
   No. 22A17 (22–58). United States, et al., Applicants v. Texas, et al.
Application for stay presented to Justice Alito and by him referred to
the Court denied. The Solicitor General suggested that the Court may
want to construe the application as a petition for certiorari before judg-
ment. Doing so, the petition is granted. The parties are directed to
brief and argue the following questions: 1. Whether the state plaintiffs
have Article III standing to challenge the Department of Homeland
Security's Guidelines for the Enforcement of Civil Immigration Law;
2. Whether the Guidelines are contrary to 8 U. S. C. § 1226(c) or 8
U. S. C. § 1231(a), or otherwise violate the Administrative Procedure
Act; and 3. Whether 8 U. S. C. § 1252(f)(1) prevents the entry of an
order to “hold unlawful and set aside” the Guidelines under 5 U. S. C.
§ 706(2).
   The Case will be set for argument in the frst week of the December
2022 argument session.
   Justice Sotomayor, Justice Kagan, Justice Barrett and Justice Jack-
son would grant the application for stay.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

  Present: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Thomas, Justice Alito, Justice
Sotomayor, Justice Kagan, Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, Justice
Barrett, and Justice Jackson.

                      Order in Pending Case
  No. 22A136. Richard Rose, et al., Applicants v. Brad Raffensperger,
Georgia Secretary of State. Application to vacate stay presented to
Justice Thomas and by him referred to the Court granted. The August
12, 2022 order of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
Circuit staying the district court's injunction is vacated. Respondent's
emergency motion for a stay pending appeal relied on the traditional
stay factors and a likelihood of success on the merits, see Nken v.
Holder, 556 U. S. 418 (2009), yet the Eleventh Circuit failed to analyze
the motion under that framework. Instead, it applied a version of the
Purcell principle, see Purcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U. S. 1 (2006) (per cu-
riam), that respondent could not fairly have advanced himself in light
of his previous representations to the district court that the schedule
on which the district court proceeded was suffcient to enable effectual
relief as to the November elections should applicants win at trial. The
Eleventh Circuit may reconsider whether a stay pending appeal is ap-
propriate, subject to sound equitable discretion.
