MONDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1959

States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied.
Mr. Justice Black and Mr. Justice Douglas are of the opinion certi-
orari should be granted. Mr. Justice Frankfurter has filed the fol-
lowing memorandum :
""For me, the reasons that govern the normal practice of the Court
in not recording votes on dispositions of petitions for certiorari are
controlling against departures from that practice. On appropriate
occasions, however, I deem it desirable to indicate the issues presented
by such a petition and the legal significance of its denial. Here, this
will become manifest from the following memorandum in which on
August 4, 1959, as a Circuit Justice, I denied the application for a
stay of the judgment, review of which is sought in this petition for
certiorari:
"""This is an application for a stay of the decree entered on July
9, 1959, by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit against the International Brotherhood of Team-
sters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen, and Helpers of America, hereafter
called the Teamsters, and certain of their officers, who, together with
the Teamsters, will be called defendants. The litigation was initiated
by thirteen members of locals of the Teamsters (one of whom has
dissociated himself from the rest), to be called plaintiffs. This ap-
plication is in effect a review of the refusal of the Court of Appeals
to grant such a stay.
"""The basis of the application is to enable defendants to file a pe-
tition for certiorari to review the decree of the Court of Appeals, the
validity of which they propose to challenge and the enforcement of
which, pending potential review and potential reversal here, will, they
claim, cause them irreparable damage. Since the contemplated pe-
tition for certiorari cannot be considered prior to the reconvening of
this Court on October 5, 1959, the threshold question on this applica-
tion is whether the issues which defendants plan to bring before the
Court are not of such a legal nature that they may fairly be deemed
so lacking in substantiality as to preclude a reasonable likelihood of
satisfying the considerations governing review on certiorari, as
guided by Rule 19 and the practice of the Court. Informed by the
illuminating opinion of Judge Fahy and having had the advantage
to hear elucidation of the issues by counsel for the parties and by the
Chairman of the Board of Monitors appointed by the United States
District Court for the District of Columbia, as provided by a consent
decree entered January 31, 1958 (the scope of which underlies the
immediate litigation), I cannot say, on a balance of probabilities,
that these issues may not commend themselves to at least four mem-
bers of this Court as warranting review here of the decree below. I
am confirmed in this view by the candid acknowledgment of the

MONDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1959
107
Chairman of the Board of Monitors and counsel for plaintiffs that
serious legal questions are at stake.
"""Accordingly, the matter before me is reduced to the very narrow
question whether I should overrule the discretion exercised by the
Court of Appeals in refusing a stay of its mandate until October 12,
which is the earliest day when this Court, in the normal course of
affairs, will determine whether to grant the prospective petition for
certiorari (assuming that it will have duly come before the Court) and
also determine, in case the petition be granted, that the decree to be
reviewed is not to be enforced pending final adjudication.
""As already indicated, at the core of this litigation is the scope
of a consent decree entered in the District Court on January 31, 1958,
and the power of the District Court, in enforcing that decree, to order
the defendants to carry out the specific directions defined by the
Court of Appeals in its decree of July 9, 1959, in accordance with the
procedure defined in that decree and in the opinion which gave rise to
it, rendered on June 10, 1959. By the consent decree, the defendants,
as officers of the Teamsters, undoubtedly assumed certain obligations
judicially enforcible. Whatever may or may not have been the free-
dom of action of these officers prior to this consent decree, by it their
freedom of action was circumscribed to the extent that the consent
decree imposed upon them enforcible obligations. The legal issue
growing out of this voluntary restriction of defendants' action is the
validity of specific recommendations by the Board of Monitors as
judicially defined and approved. Such orders, as they have been
defined by the Court of Appeals, are concededly unconsented and are
challenged as unwarranted, unilateral modifications of the consent
decree.
666
"""I have said that these specific commands, about half a dozen
in number, restrict what is asserted to be the freedom of the power
of officers of the Teamsters, claimed to be theirs under the constitution
of the union. According to the Court of Appeals, these judicial
commands upon the defendants are merely enforcement of the obliga-
tions which they undertook by the consent decree and are not one-
sided modifications of it. This is the controversy to be raised by the
petition for certiorari which the defendants plan to file. But, in
any event, they claim that by denying a stay until the matter can
duly come before this Court, the Court of Appeals has commanded
them to take action of an irreparable nature claimed to be outside
the scope of the consent decree and in derogation of the powers of the
officers under the constitution of the Teamsters, before this Court
has had an opportunity to pass on the petition for certiorari, with the
derivative problem whether to keep matters in status quo until such
a petition, if granted, could be disposed of on its merits.

MONDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1959

"""If it were clear that between now and October 12, which is the
earliest day for the disposition of the proposed petition for certiorari,
what the Court of Appeals has directed to be done would be capable
of being carried out so as to change, irrevocably and adversely, the
rights and powers claimed by defendants, before this Court had an
opportunity to determine the validity of what the defendants have
been ordered to do, I would feel constrained to grant the stay. It
may well be that the Court of Appeals, after due consideration, on
July 15, 1959, denied this stay on its forecast that its decree could not,
in view of all the circumstances, be effectuated before this Court could
pass on a petition for certiorari, with the ancillary question of a stay
in case such petition were granted. In any event, my appreciation
of the intrinsic elements in carrying out the various items of the
decree still left in controversy (several of them have become either
moot or taken out of contest by agreement) leads me to conclude that,
in the setting of the immediate circumstances, they are not of a nature
to cause irreparable harm between now and October 12. I am rein-
forced in this conclusion by the responsible assurances of the Chair-
man of the Board of Monitors regarding the course of events which
will control such matters. The details of the half-dozen items in
controversy are so specialized and technical that nothing would be
gained by particularizing them.
6 66
"""One thing more does need to be said.
666
"""As is recognized by all concerned, judicial supervision of a
union with a membership of 1,500,000 and some 800 locals through
the agency of a mechanism like the Board of Monitors is an unusual
manifestation of equity powers. Defendants seek to enlarge the
significance of the immediate items in controversy by their anticipa-
tion of an expansion of the powers of the Board of Monitors and
their resulting fear of disruption of forces within the Teamsters as
well as a heavy drain on the Teamsters' treasury in course of such
far-flung judicial administration. These are matters not immedi-
ately involved in the decree of the Court of Appeals now before me.
But I deem it appropriate to say that the Court of Appeals, in its
decision of June 10, 1959, as well as on preliminary proceedings and
in the procedure which it followed in formulating its decree of July
9, 1959, has manifested an alert understanding of the gravity of the
litigation, and has made manifest its sense of the high importance of
assuring the most protective procedure on the part of the Board of
Monitors in making recommendations and of the District Court in
issuing orders on the basis of such recommendations; it has been
mindful of the importance of working out problems between the
Monitors and the Teamsters on the basis of ample consultation, with
full regard for the interests of the membership of the union of which,
after all, the union is the collective expression. As to the fear of ex-

MONDAY, DECEMBER 7, 1959
109
cessive drain of the Teamsters' treasury, one may safely rely on the
Court of Appeals in affording a shining example in the spending of
other people's money. A court should be the most sensitive of fiduci-
aries. In sanctioning fees and other expenditures it will be guided
by frugality and not generosity.”

tition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for
the Sixth Circuit denied. The Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Douglas and
Mr. Justice Brennan, although cognizant that the District Court re-
tained jurisdiction of the action during the transition, would grant
the petition for certiorari limited to the fourth question: whether the
provisions of paragraphs four and five of the plan are constitutionally
invalid for the reason that they "explicitly recognized race as an ab-
solute ground for the transfer of students between schools, thereby
perpetuating rather than limiting racial discrimination."
No. 285, Misc. New York ex rel. Fred Smith, Jr., petitioner, v.
Walter B. Martin, Warden. Petition for writ of certiorari to the

Kansas denied.
No. 432, Misc. John David Randolph, petitioner, v. B. J. Rhay,
Superintendent of Washington State Penitentiary. Petition for writ
of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Washington denied.
No. 288, Misc. Jerry Thomas Ashcraft, petitioner, v. United
States. Petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied. Mr. Justice Black and
Mr. Justice Douglas dissenting. The Fifth Amendment provides
that no person "shall be subject for the same offense to be twice put
in jeopardy of life or limb ***" In this connection it seems ap-
propriate to us to place on record the facts of this case in which certi-
orari is denied. Ashcraft was convicted of robbery in violation of
California laws and given a sentence of five years to life imprison-
ment. Now the United States has convicted him of precisely the same
robbery and sentenced him to prison for 25 years. We are still un-
able to believe such a second punishment for one crime is either fair
or consistent with the Fifth Amendment's prohibition against double
jeopardy. See the dissents in Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S. 187,
201; Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U.S. 121, 150; Gore v. United States,
357 U.S. 386, 395–397.

Petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of California
denied. The Chief Justice took no part in the consideration or deci-

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Present: Mr. Chief Justice Warren, Mr. Justice Black, Mr. Justice
Frankfurter, Mr. Justice Douglas, Mr. Justice Clark, Mr. Justice
Harlan, Mr. Justice Brennan, Mr. Justice Whittaker, and Mr. Justice
Stewart.
ORDER
No. United States of America, petitioner, v. Curtis M. Thomas,
Registrar of Voters of Washington Parish, Louisiana, et al. On
application to vacate order of the Court of Appeals granting stay of
injunction pending appeal and to reinstate injunction issued by the
District Court. Per Curiam: The application of the United States
for an order vacating the stay order of the Court of Appeals entered
January 21, 1960, and reinstating the decree of the District Court,
together with the request of the Attorney General of Louisiana for
argument thereon, have been considered by the Court.
1. It appears, as respondents pointed out in their application to
the Court of Appeals for the stay herein, that the issues in United
States v. Raines, No. 64, now pending on appeal in this Court, are
pertinent to the disposition of this case. In view of this, and of the
fact that the issues raised by this application are closely related to
those involved on the merits of the controversy now before the Court
of Appeals, the Court believes that the entire matter should be con-
sidered at one time. In light of the foregoing, and of the imminence
of the State general election scheduled for April 19, 1960, the Court
will entertain a petition for certiorari to review the judgment of the
District Court, 28 U.S.C. §§ 1254 (1), 2101 (e), if filed by the Solicitor
General on or before January 29, 1960. The petition may be filed
in typewritten form. See the action of the Court as to Bolling v.
Sharpe, et al., 344 U.S., at 3.
2. In the event that such a petition is so filed, the Court will hear
argument upon the present application, the petition, and the merits,
on February 23, 1960, the case to be set at the head of the calendar
for that day. See Hannah v. Larche, No. 549; Hannah v. Slawson,
No. 550, 361 U.S. December 7, 1959.
'
3. The record, which may be filed in typewritten form, and the
Government's brief on all matters will be filed on or before February
| 10, 1960, and the answering briefs of the respondents will be filed on
or before February 20, 1960. The Government may file a reply brief
on or before February 22, 1960.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Present: Mr. Chief Justice Warren, Mr. Justice Black, Mr. Justice
Frankfurter, Mr. Justice Douglas, Mr. Justice Clark, Mr. Justice
Harlan, Mr. Justice Brennan, Mr. Justice Whittaker, and Mr. Justice
Stewart.
ORDER
No. 537. Communist Party of the United States of America, peti-
tioner, v. Subversive Activities Control Board. Motion for leave to
use as part of the record the printed record heretofore filed with this
Court in No. 48, October Term, 1955, granted. Petition for writ
of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia granted.
No. 8. Junius Irving Scales, petitioner, v. United States of
America; and
No. 464. John Francis Noto, petitioner, v. United States. These
two cases were set for argument on February 23 next. In the mean-
time there intervened the filing of the petition in No. 537, which we
have just granted. Nos. 8 and 464 arose under the Smith Act (Act
of June 25, 1948, c. 645, § 2385, 62 Stat. 808) and No. 537 under Title
I of the Internal Security Act of 1950 (Act of September 23, 1950,
c. 1024, 64 Stat. 987). However, some of the constitutional and stat-
utory issues raised by these two enactments are clearly interrelated
and their determination in the two former cases may affect their deter-
mination in the latter case and vice versa. Accordingly, the Court
deems it important that these three cases be heard and considered
together. Since the Court's calendar for the remainder of the Term
precludes this, Nos. 8 and 464 are reset for argument on Monday,
October 10, 1960, to be followed immediately by the argument in
No. 537.
MR. JUSTICE CLARK, dissenting.
This order, coming as it does in mid-Term with five months of ses-
sions yet remaining, is without precedent. It delays for another year
decisions on two important acts of the Congress-the Smith Act and
the Internal Security Act of 1950.
Scales' case has already been on our active docket for five successive
Terms and has twice been fully argued. Petition for certiorari was
first granted during the October Term 1955, 350 U.S. 992, and the first
oral argument was on October 10, 1956 (October Term 1956). The
case was held under advisement until June 3, 1957, when it was put
over to the October Term 1957 for reargument. At that time, on mo-

tion of the Solicitor General, it was remanded on a subsidiary issue
in the light of our opinion in Jencks v. United States (353 U.S. 657),
decided in the interim. 355 U.S. 1. On retrial, Scales was convicted
again and the Court of Appeals affirmed, 260 F. 2d 21. We granted
certiorari again on December 15, 1958, in our October Term 1958. 358
U.S. 917. It was argued the second time in 1959, and in June, over
my objection, 360 U.S. 925, was reset for the October Term 1959. It
was then set for November 19, but was put over to February 23, 1960,
when certiorari was granted in Noto, 361 U.S. 813. The argument in
the October Term 1960 will be the third argument. I have found no
appellate case in the history of the Court that has been carried on the
active docket so many consecutive Terms or argued so often. Ten
hours argument time here will have been given to it alone. Noto ad-
mittedly involves the same issue as Scales. It has already been here
two successive Terms and this order will make the third, placing it next
to the unprecedented position occupied by Scales.
Likewise the Communist Party case, No. 537, has been argued here
on the merits once before.¹ This case seeks registration of the Com-
munist Party under the Internal Security Act which was passed by
the Congress in 1950. Four years ago this Court had full argument
on it and remanded it to the Board for reconsideration of its factual
determinations. I dissented from this action. 351 U.S., at 125.
Nor do the briefs in these cases raise any overlapping constitutional
issues. As I read them, the only interrelation would be the effect on
the Smith Act of § 4(f) of the Internal Security Act.2 Although
Noto and the Communist Party have the same counsel, he has not
pointed out any such overlapping or interrelation whatever, nor indi-
cated in any way that the arguments should be set together. No
such request has been made. In fact, by motion he has asked that the
printed record used here on the previous argument in the Communist
Party case be used again, as supplemented by the certified record
made on remand. The Court has granted this motion. This paves
the way for argument in the case this Term. Available time could
be had in late March to hear all three cases by merely switching other
cases to the six-hour argument period of Scales and Noto now set for
February 23. I think that this would be entirely appropriate. It
would give the Communist Party some 60 days in which to prepare
its briefs. This is ample time, since the issues in its case are the same
as when the case was here before, the record for the most part is iden-
tical, and the lawyers who argued it then are handling the case again.
Although in regular course the Communist Party case would not be
1 Communist Party v. Control Board, 351 U.S. 115 (1956).
* "Sec. 4(f). Neither the holding of office nor membership in any Communist organiza-
tion by any person shall constitute per se a violation of subsection (a) or subsection (c)
of this section or of any other criminal statute. . . .”

reached until next Term, there is ample precedent for advancing the
same and setting it in March. Likewise, if the argument in the Scales,
Noto, and Communist Party cases were set in March it would leave
three months before our adjournment in which to prepare the opin-
ions. This appears to me more than ample, since the cases have been
argued and considered here before.
But whether the Communist Party case is advanced or not, I think
we should hear Scales and Noto this Term. Noto has the same coun-
sel in his case as does the Communist Party in its, and in the argu-
ment of Noto counsel will certainly cover in detail his position on
§ 4(f). Six hours are assigned to these cases this month. If the
Party's position conflicts with Scales and Noto, he could present both
positions, just as he would do next October in any event. In fact, I
have said, the interpretation of § 4(f) is a subsidiary point in the
Communist Party case, being covered in its brief by only three para-
graphs, while it may be decisive in the Scales and Noto cases. Any
overlap would not reach the constitutionality of either the Smith
Act or the Internal Security Act.
For these reasons I dissent.

Second Circuit denied. Mr. Justice Douglas dissenting:
In my view the issues involved in this case are of such great public
importance that I record my dissent to the denial of certiorari.
The petitioners in this case are residents of a heavily populated sub-
urban area in Long Island, New York, who brought an action in 1957
to enjoin respondents, federal and state officials, from carrying out a
threatened program of aerial spraying of their lands, homes, gardens,
and orchards with a mixture of DDT and kerosene designed to eradi-
cate the gypsy moth, an insect injurious to forests. The program is
part of a campaign embarked in 1956 by the Department of Agricul-
ture to spray more than 3,000,000 acres of land in 10 States.
Petitioners alleged in their complaint that the threatened spraying
was unauthorized by statute and so injurious to health and property
as to violate the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.
The District Court denied a motion for preliminary injunction on
May 24, 1957. 151 F. Supp. 786. Pending trial petitioners' homes,
persons and lands received the spray. Respondents then contended
that, because they had completed the spraying, the request for an
injunction had become moot.
At the trial numerous experts testified to the public need for the
spraying and the feasible methods available for the eradication of
the gypsy moth. Petitioners attempted to adduce evidence that the
use of multi-engine airplanes was unnecessary, that their property

had not been infested with the moths, and that the use of ground
spraying equipment and helicopters was a feasible means of avoiding
uninfested areas with the spray.
1
Expert witnesses testified that the spraying of pastures with the
mixture, which consisted of one pound of DDT in one gallon of kero-
sene base solvent, applied at the rate of one gallon per acre, inevitably
produces measurable quantities of DDT in milk from cattle which
feed on the pastures, and that crops ¹ which have been sprayed by
DDT should not be fed to cattle. Nevertheless, dairy farms, pas-
tures, homes, gardens, orchards, swimming pools, and fish ponds re-
ceived the spray; and in some cases, it seems, they received substan-
tially more than the planned one gallon per acre.
There was evidence that one of the petitioners who sells milk from
her dairy had measurable contamination in the milk as late as five
months after the spraying, which made its sale illegal under both
federal and state regulations.
There was evidence that the vegetables grown by one of the peti-
tioners for family use were rendered inedible and the leaves on some
of his vines turned brown, rotted and fell off as a result of the spray-
ing. Another petitioner, who spent $13,000 developing her land for
chemical-free food production, testified that after the planes came over
her plants were damaged and the fruit was withered, making it inedi-
ble. Several other petitioners complained that their fruits, vegeta-
bles, and berries were made unfit to eat.
Fish owned by two of the petitioners were said to have been killed
by the spray; and dead birds were also reported. Predatory insects
were also said to have been destroyed and as a result the quantity of
red spiders and other pests increased. There was evidence that cloth-
ing was spotted and even ruined and that children coughed from the
spraying and their eyes watered.
The extent of the danger of DDT to human health was a matter of
sharp dispute among the numerous expert witnesses in the case. The
testimony on many facets of this issue was extensive and elaborate.
Yet the District Court made only one finding on the subject. It
found: "The spraying program, which is the subject of this action,
at the rate of one pound of DDT per gallon of solvent per acre, is not
injurious to human health." No more specific findings were made on
the matter and the court refused to make any findings on the spray's
effect on milk, fruits, vegetables or other crops or products. Its only
other finding on the issue of injury was that the spray "does not cause
any considerable loss of birds, fish, bees or beneficial insects."

The complaint was dismissed on the ground, inter alia, that there
was no proof of damages or that further spraying with airplanes
was a likelihood. 164 F. Supp. 120.
The Court of Appeals, without reaching the merits, vacated the
decision of the District Court with directions to dismiss on the ground
of mootness. 270 F. 2d 419. It held that respondents' evidence that
another wholesale spraying operation was unlikely precluded the
petitioners from obtaining an injunction.² The respondents did not,
however, give positive assurance that they would not spray the area
again if it became necessary. In fact, it was indicated that if studies
reveal that the eradication was not complete, respondents will resort
to further poisoning, though perhaps only local in nature and pos-
sibly with different equipment. The program clearly was not aban-
doned.
In other cases we have held that the cessation of the activity com-
plained of did not render the case moot, e.g., United States v. W. T.
Grant & Co., 345 U.S. 629, 632, and if future activity of the nature
complained of is feared, the courts are not impotent to fashion a
remedy which minimizes any injury from a recurrence of the practice.
The public interest in this controversy is not confined to a com-
munity in New York. Respondents' spraying program is aimed at
millions of acres of land throughout the Eastern United States.
Moreover, the use of DDT in residential areas and on dairy farms is
thought by many to present a serious threat to human health as
evidenced by the record in this case as well as alarms sounded by
others on the problem. The need for adequate findings on the effect
of DDT is of vital concern not only to wildlife conservationists and
owners of domestic animals but to all who drink milk or eat food
from sprayed gardens.
We are told by the scientists that DDT is an insoluble that cows
get from barns and fields that have been sprayed with it. The DDT
enters the milk and becomes stored by people in the fatty tissues
of the body. Because it is a potential menace to health the Food
and Drug Administration maintains that any DDT in milk in inter-
state commerce is illegal.4
2 The Court of Appeals remarked that in the event of a possible recurrence of spraying
in the area, "it would seem well to point out the advisability for a district court, faced
with a claim concerning aerial spraying or any other program which may cause incon-
venience and damage as widespread as this 1957 spraying appears to have caused, to
inquire closely into the methods and safeguards of any proposed procedures so that inci-
dents of the seemingly unnecessary and unfortunate nature here disclosed, may be reduced
to a minimum, assuming, of course, that the government will have shown such a program
to be required in the public interest." 270 F. 2d, at 421, n. 1.

The effect of DDT on birds and on their reproductive powers and
on other wildlife, 5 the effect of DDT as a factor in certain types of
disease in man such as poliomyelitis, hepatitis, leukemia and other
blood disorders, the mounting sterility among our bald eagles have
led to increasing concern in many quarters 3 about the wisdom of the
use of this and other insecticides. The alarms that many experts and
responsible officials have raised about the perils of DDT underline the
public importance of this case.

8 See the comments by Congressman Lee Metcalf, Cong. Rec. App., March 18, 1959,
A2375, Sept. 2, 1959, pp. 16300–16301. Congressman Metcalf said:
"We all know of plant or wildlife loss from chemical controls-such as the death of
fish in Montana trout streams in areas sprayed by DDT; the virtual wiping out of quail
and rabbit populations in two areas treated with heptachlor in the South. Considerable
damage to valuable fish and wildlife resources has occurred unnecessarily because chemi-
cals were applied without sufficient knowledge of accepted procedures or without full
regard to the consequences."
Rachel Carson wrote in the Washington Post, April 10, 1959, p. A12:
"During the past 15 years, the use of highly poisonous hydrocarbons and of organic
phosphates allied to the nerve gases of chemical warfare has built up from small begin-
nings to what a noted British ecologist recently called 'an amazing rain of death upon
the surface of the earth.' Most of these chemicals leave long-persisting residues on vege-
tation, in soils, and even in the bodies of earthworms and other organisms on which birds
depend for food.
"The key to the decimation of the robins, which in some parts of the country already
amounts to virtual extinction, is their reliance on earthworms as food. The sprayed
leaves with their load of poison eventually fall to become part of the leaf litter of the
soil; earthworms acquire and store the poisons through feeding on the leaves; the fol-
lowing spring the returning robins feed on the worms. As few as 11 such earthworms
are a lethal dose, a fact confirmed by careful research in Illinois.
"The death of the robins is not mere speculation. The leading authority on this
problem, Professor George Wallace of Michigan State University, has recently reported
that 'Dead and dying robins, the latter most often found in a state of violent convulsions,
are most common in the spring, when warm rains bring up the earthworms, but birds
that survive are apparently sterile or at least experience nearly complete reproductive
failure.'
"The fact that doses are sub-lethal may yet induce sterility is one of the most alarming
aspects of the problem of insecticides. The evidence on this point, from many highly
competent scientists, is too strong to question. It should be weighed by all who use the
modern insecticides, or condone their use.
"I do not wish to leave the impression that only birds that feed on earthworms are
endangered. To quote Professor Wallace briefly: 'Tree-top feeders are affected in an
entirely different way, by insect shortages, or actual consumption of poisoned insects
Birds that forage on trunks and branches are also affected, perhaps mostly by the dormant
sprays.' About two-thirds of the bird species that were formerly summer residents in the
area under Professor Wallace's observation have disappeared entirely or are sharply
reduced.
"To many of us, this sudden silencing of the song of birds, this obliteration of the color
and beauty and interest of bird life, is sufficient cause for sharp regret. To those who
have never known such rewarding enjoyment of nature, there should yet remain a nagging
and insistent question: If this 'rain of death' has produced so disastrous an effect on
birds, what of other lives, including our own?"

OPINION
No. 10, Original. United States of America, plaintiff, v. States of
Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. On motion
for judgment on the pleadings.
As to the States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, a decree
will be entered (1) declaring that the United States is entitled, as
against these States, to all the lands, minerals, and other natural
resources underlying the Gulf of Mexico more than three geographic
miles from the coast of each such State, that is, from the line of
ordinary low-water mark and outer limit of inland waters, and ex-
tending seaward to the edge of the Continental Shelf; (2) declaring
that none of these States is entitled to any interest in such lands,
minerals, and resources; (3) enjoining these States from interfering
with the rights of the United States therein; (4) directing each such
State appropriately to account to the United States for all sums of
money derived therefrom subsequent to June 5, 1950; and (5) dis-
missing the cross-bill of the State of Alabama.
As to the State of Texas, a decree will be entered (1) declaring
that the State is entitled, as against the United States, to the lands,
minerals, and other natural resources underlying the Gulf of Mexico
to a distance of three leagues from Texas' coast, that is, from the line
of ordinary low-water mark and outer limit of inland waters; (2) de-
claring that the United States is entitled, as against Texas, to no
interest therein; (3) declaring that the United States is entitled, as
against Texas, to all such lands, minerals, and resources lying beyond
that area, and extending to the edge of the Continental Shelf; (4)
enjoining the State from interfering with the rights of the United
States therein; (5) directing Texas appropriately to account to the
United States for all sums of money derived since June 5, 1950, from
the area to which the United States is declared to be entitled.
Jurisdiction over this case will be retained for such further pro-
ceedings as may be necessary to effectuate the rights adjudicated
herein.
The motions of Louisiana and Mississippi to take depositions and
present evidence are denied, without prejudice to their renewal in such
further proceedings as may be had in connection with matters left
open by this opinion. The same disposition is made of the similar
averment in Alabama's answer. Texas' motion for similar relief and
for a severance is rendered moot by our decision as to it.

TUESDAY, MAY 31, 1960
304
The alternative motion of Louisiana, contained in its answer to
the original complaint herein, to transfer the case as to it to the
United States District Court in Louisiana is denied.
The parties may submit an appropriate form of decree giving
effect to the conclusions reached in the opinion of this Court. Opinion
by Mr. Justice Harlan. Separate opinion by Mr. Justice Black,
concurring in part and dissenting in part. Dissenting opinion by
Mr. Justice Douglas. Mr. Chief Justice Warren and Mr. Justice
Clark took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
No. 10, Original. United States of America, plaintiff, v. State of
Florida et al. On motion for judgment on the pleadings. The mo-
tion of the United States for judgment on the pleadings as to Florida
is denied. It is held that the Submerged Lands Act grants Florida
a three-marine-league belt of land under the Gulf, seaward from its
coastline, as described in Florida's 1868 Constitution. The cause is
retained for such further proceedings as may be necessary more
specifically to determine the coastline and fix the boundary and all
other relevant matters. The parties may submit an appropriate form
of decree giving effect to the conclusions reached in the opinion of this
Court. Opinion by Mr. Justice Black. Concurring opinion by Mr.
Justice Frankfurter with whom Mr. Justice Brennan, Mr. Justice
Whittaker, and Mr. Justice Stewart join. Dissenting opinion by Mr.
Justice Harlan. Mr. Chief Justice Warren and Mr. Justice Clark
took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
The Chief Justice said:
"The other orders of the Court have been certified by the Chief
Justice and filed with the Clerk and will not be announced orally.”
