SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

   Present: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer,
Justice Alito, Justice Sotomayor, Justice Kagan, Justice Gorsuch, and
Justice Kavanaugh.
   The Chief Justice said:
   “I have the honor to announce, on behalf of the Court, that the Octo-
ber 2018 Term of the Supreme Court of the United States is now
closed, and the October 2019 Term is now convened.
   “Justice Thomas is unable to be present today. He is indisposed due
to illness, but he will participate in the consideration and decision of
the cases on the basis of the briefs and the transcripts or recordings of
the oral arguments.
   “Today's orders of the Court have been duly entered and certifed,
and fled with the Clerk.
   “I would like to note that August 3, 2019, marked the 25th Anniver-
sary of the day our colleague Justice Breyer took the Judicial and Con-
stitutional Oaths as a new Member of this Court. On behalf of the
Court, I congratulate you, Justice Breyer, on your distinguished serv-
ice, and I look forward to sharing many more years with you in our
common calling.
   “I also want take a moment to pay tribute to our friend and colleague
John Paul Stevens, a retired Justice of this Court, who died on July 16,
2019. Justice Stevens was nominated to the Court by President Ford
on November 28, 1975, and was confrmed by the Senate less than 20
days later. He was an active Member of the Court for more than 34
years. At the time of his retirement on June 29, 2010, Justice Stevens
had become the third-longest serving Justice in the history of the
Court.
   “Justice Stevens devoted his life to public service. He was a commis-
sioned offcer in the United States Navy from 1941-1945, receiving a
Bronze Star for his service. During the 1947 Term he was a law clerk
to Justice Wiley Rutledge of this Court. Before joining this Court,
Justice Stevens served fve years on the United States Court of Ap-
peals for the Seventh Circuit.
   “His kindness, humility, independence, and wisdom have left us a
better Court. His commitment to justice has left us a better Nation.
   “Justice Stevens was a dear colleague and friend. Our condolences
go out to his children, his extended family, and his many admirers. At
2                        MONDAY, OCTOBER 7, 2019

an appropriate time in the spring, the traditional memorial observance
of the Court and Bar will be held in this courtroom.”

  Present: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Thomas, Justice Ginsburg,
Justice Breyer, Justice Alito, Justice Sotomayor, Justice Kagan, Justice
Gorsuch, and Justice Kavanaugh.

                           Announcement
  In keeping with public health precautions recommended in response
to COVID-19, the Supreme Court is postponing the oral arguments
currently scheduled for the March session (March 23–25 and March 30–
April 1). The Court will examine the options for rescheduling those
cases in due course in light of the developing circumstances.
  The Court will hold its regularly scheduled Conference on Friday,
March 20. Some Justices may participate remotely by telephone. The
Court will issue its regularly scheduled Order List on Monday, March
23 at 9:30 a.m. The list will be posted on the Court's Website at that
time: https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/ordersofthecourt/19.
  The Building will continue to be open for offcial business, and fling
deadlines are not extended under Rule 30.1. The Court is expanding
remote working capabilities to reduce the number of employees in the
Building, consistent with public health guidance. The Building will re-
main closed to the public until further notice.
  The Court's postponement of argument sessions in light of public
health concerns is not unprecedented. The Court postponed scheduled
arguments for October 1918 in response to the Spanish fu epidemic.
The Court also shortened its argument calendars in August 1793 and
August 1798 in response to yellow fever outbreaks.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

  Present: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Thomas, Justice Ginsburg,
Justice Breyer, Justice Alito, Justice Sotomayor, Justice Kagan, Justice
Gorsuch, and Justice Kavanaugh.

                                ORDER
  In light of the ongoing public health concerns relating to COVID-19,
the following shall apply to cases prior to a ruling on a petition for a
writ of certiorari:
  IT IS ORDERED that the deadline to fle any petition for a writ of
certiorari due on or after the date of this order is extended to 150 days
from the date of the lower court judgment, order denying discretionary
review, or order denying a timely petition for rehearing. See Rules 13.1
and 13.3.
  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that motions for extensions of time
pursuant to Rule 30.4 will ordinarily be granted by the Clerk as a
matter of course if the grounds for the application are diffculties relat-
ing to COVID-19 and if the length of the extension requested is reason-
able under the circumstances. Such motions should indicate whether
the opposing party has an objection.
  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, notwithstanding Rules 15.5 and
15.6, the Clerk will entertain motions to delay distribution of a petition
for writ of certiorari where the grounds for the motion are that the
petitioner needs additional time to fle a reply due to diffculties relat-
ing to COVID-19. Such motions will ordinarily be granted by the Clerk
as a matter of course if the length of the extension requested is reason-
able under the circumstances and if the motion is actually received by
the Clerk at least two days prior to the relevant distribution date. Such
motions should indicate whether the opposing party has an objection.
  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that these modifcations to the Court's
Rules and practices do not apply to cases in which certiorari has been
granted or a direct appeal or original action has been set for argument.
  These modifcations will remain in effect until further order of the
Court.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

  Present: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Thomas, Justice Ginsburg,
Justice Breyer, Justice Alito, Justice Sotomayor, Justice Kagan, Justice
Gorsuch, and Justice Kavanaugh.

                                 Order
   In light of the ongoing public health concerns relating to COVID-19:
   IT IS ORDERED that with respect to every document fled in a case
prior to a ruling on a petition for a writ of certiorari or petition for an
extraordinary writ, or a decision to set an appeal for argument, a single
paper copy of the document, formatted on 8½ x 11 inch paper, may be
fled. The document may be formatted under the standards set forth in
Rule 33.2, or under the standards set forth in Rule 33.1 but printed on
8½ x 11 inch paper. The Court may later request that a document
initially submitted on 8½ x 11 inch paper be submitted in booklet
format.
   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the following types of documents
should not be fled in paper form if they are submitted through the
Court's electronic fling system: (1) motions for an extension of time
under Rule 30.4; (2) waivers of the right to respond to a petition under
Rule 15.5; (3) blanket consents to the fling of amicus briefs under Rules
37.2(a) and 37.3(a); and (4) motions to delay distribution of a cert peti-
tion under the Court's Order of March 19, 2020. Notwithstanding Rule
34.6 and paragraph 9 of the Guidelines for the Submission of Docu-
ments to the Supreme Court's Electronic Filing System, these enumer-
ated flings should be fled electronically in cases governed by Rule
34.6, although other types of documents in those cases should still be
fled in paper form only.
   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, notwithstanding Rule 29.3, par-
ties may be relieved of the obligation to effect service of paper versions
of flings upon other parties if they agree to electronic service; parties
are strongly encouraged to use electronic service if feasible.
   These modifcations will remain in effect until further order of the
Court.

   No. 19A1041. Mark Williams, Warden, et al., Applicants v. Craig
Wilson, et al. The application for stay presented to Justice Sotomayor
and by her referred to the Court denied.
   The Government is seeking a stay only of the District Court's April
22 preliminary injunction. But on May 19, the District Court issued a
new order enforcing the preliminary injunction and imposing addi-
tional measures. The Government has not sought review of or a stay
of the May 19 order in the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.
Particularly in light of that procedural posture, the Court declines to
stay the District Court's April 22 preliminary injunction without prej-
udice to the Government seeking a new stay if circumstances warrant.
   Justice Thomas, Justice Alito, and Justice Gorsuch would grant the
application.

                       Order in Pending Case
   No. 20A28. Republican National Committee, et al., Applicants v.
Common Cause Rhode Island, et al. Application for stay presented to
Justice Breyer and by him referred to the Court denied. Unlike Merrill
v. People First of Alabama, 591 U. S. ––– (2020), and other similar
cases where a State defends its own law, here the state election offcials
support the challenged decree, and no state offcial has expressed oppo-
sition. Under these circumstances, the applicants lack a cognizable in-
terest in the State's ability to “enforce its duly enacted” laws. Abbott
v. Perez, 585 U. S. –––, ––– n. 17 (2018). The status quo is one in which
the challenged requirement has not been in effect, given the rules used
in Rhode Island's last election, and many Rhode Island voters may well
hold that belief.
   Justice Thomas, Justice Alito, and Justice Gorsuch would grant the
application.
