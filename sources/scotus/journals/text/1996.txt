(JOURNAL)                 MONDAY, OCTOBER 7, 1996                       1
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

  Present: Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice Stevens, Justice O’Connor,
Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, Justice Souter, Justice Thomas, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer.
  The Chief Justice said:
  “I have the honor to announce, on behalf of the Court, that the Octo-
ber 1995 Term of the Supreme Court of the United States is now closed
and that the October 1996 Term is now convened. Today’s orders of the
Court have been duly entered and certified and filed with the Clerk,
and they won’t be otherwise announced.”
                 Certiorari—Summary Disposition
   No. 95–1708. Greater New Orleans Broadcasting Association, Inc.,
etc., et al., Petitioners v. United States, et al. On petition for writ of
certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.
Petition for writ of certiorari granted. Judgment vacated, and case
remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit
for further consideration in light of 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Is-
land, 517 U. S. ––– (1996).
   No. 95–1733. United States, Petitioner v. Terry J. Hatter, Jr., Judge,
United States District Court for the Central District of California, et
al. Because the Court lacks a quorum, 28 U. S. C. Section 1, and since
a majority of the qualified Justices are of the opinion that the case
cannot be heard and determined at the next Term of the Court, the
judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit
is affirmed under 28 U. S. C. Section 2109, which provides that under
these circumstances the Court shall enter its order affirming the judg-
ment of the court from which the case was brought for review with the
same effect as upon affirmance by an equally divided Court. Justice
Stevens, Justice O’Connor, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer took
no part in the consideration or decision of this petition.
   No. 95–2010. Edward B. Crouse, Petitioner v. United States. On peti-
tion for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for
the Sixth Circuit. Petition for writ of certiorari granted. Judgment
vacated, and case remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for
the Sixth Circuit for further consideration in light of Koon v. United
States, 518 U. S. ––– (1996).
   No. 95–2090. Larry Fields, Director, Oklahoma Department of Cor-
rections, et al., Petitioners v. Bobby Battle, etc., and United States. On
