circuit court of appeals for the seventh circuit. It is the opinion of this
court that the grant of letters patent to James Boyle was not void because
of the death of Boyle before the patent was issued, and that it should be
construed in the alternative as a grant to James Boyle, or his heirs, or
assigns, which would include a grantee or grantees in being capable of
taking the patent and to whose benefit the grant would inure; that the
patent should be construed as a grant to Thomas L. Rankin as assignee,

179
Mr. Attorney-General Olney addressed the court as follows:
I have been requested, if your honors please, to present to the court the
resolutions of the bar upon the occasion of the death of Mr. Justice Lamar.
In undertaking that duty I have no hesitation in saying that the resolu-
tions, which I shall presently read, do but simple justice to the character
of your late associate and in no way exaggerate either the great loss of the
whole community or the profound affliction of a very large circle of
friends and acquaintances. Under any circumstances, the death of a
justice of this court is of preeminent importance. Though the
court remains; an element disappears which had vitally affected its
deliberations and its results, to be succeeded by a new one different
to some extent in the nature of things and possibly of a wholly diverse
character. Thus, as one departs and another assumes his place, a new
order of things arises, all the more surely because it comes insensibly and
almost by stealth. It is a new order of the greatest moment because, in the
scope and extent of its jurisdiction and power, as touching on the one hand
the private rights of every one of sixty millions of people and dealing on
the other with the collective rights of numerous populous communities and
sovereign States, no court like it or even strongly resembling it has ever
existed among men. To have sat upon such a court without reproach and
without discredit, may well fill to the full the measure of the loftiest ambition.
With Mr. Justice Lamar has passed away not merely a lawyer and a judge,
but a notable historical figure. It may have been his misfortune as a
lawyer, though certainly his good fortune as a man, that his lot was cast
in tempestuous times-in times which, however adverse to the acquisition of
technical knowledge and technical skill, always and inevitably develop
whatever there is in a man of intellectual and moral greatness. He was
born when the echoes of the sectional contest over the admission of Mis-
souri into the Union-that issue which startled Jefferson "like a fire bell
in the night "were still resounding throughout the land.
He was a
mere youth when the Missouri Compromise was succeeded by another, and
the specter of disunion was laid for a time by the mingled firmness and
moderation of General Jackson.
He had hardly entered upon the practice of the law when North and
South again came into violent collision over the fugitive-slave law and the
extension of slavery into the Territories. He went with his section and his
State in the civil war that followed only ten years later, and supported
their cause with equal devotion on the battlefield and in the forum.
Always and under all circumstances he was a leader, not merely followed
and obeyed, but implicitly trusted and sincerely loved. He continued to
lead even more decisively and on a larger field when arms were laid down,
and to him more than to any other one man, North or South, is due the adop-
tion by both victors and vanquished of those counsels of moderation and

180
magnanimity and wisdom which have made the edifice of our constitu-
tional Union more impregnable to all assault than ever before. But this
eventful and stormy career, these engrossing and exciting occupations and
achievements of the soldier and statesman and patriot, necessarily inter-
rupted and prevented that exclusive devotion to the science of jurispru
dence and that constant familiarity with its practical application in the
administration of justice which that jealous mistress, the law, inexorably
exacts of all her followers.
I do not believe that Mr. Justice Lamar ever practiced law, as his sole
or chief occupation, for any one term of five consecutive years. I am un-
able to discover that he could have made the practice of the law his sole
or principal pursuit for more than ten or twelve years in all. And it is
the highest possible tribute to his natural genius, to his legal instincts, and
extraordinary intellectual gifts, that, in spite of all the disadvantages under
which he labored, Mr. Justice Lamar performed his part as a member of
this high court, of judicature not only to the acceptance of the bench and
the bar, but with such intelligent and well-directed zeal and devotion that
only failing health and strength could have prevented his ultimately attain-
ing decided judicial eminence.
The resolutions I have the honor to present are as follows:
Resolved, That by the death of Mr. Justice Lamar the country loses a
judge whose career on the bench, though brief, showed that he had a rare
judicial mind and temperament, with a great power of legal analysis and -
a faculty of expressing himself in nervous English, which left no room
for misunderstanding. His long service in public life fitted him to deal
with the great questions of constitutional law which make a seat upon the
bench of the Supreme Court so important and so responsible. He entered
early into the public service and soon became prominent. When the
war closed no one was more conspicuous than he in efforts to allay
distrust, to do away with division and coldness, and to produce,
throughout the Union, a feeling of confidence and good will. For this he
labored and spoke in the Senate; and, with this ever before his eyes,
he administered the Department of the Interior. We offer this tribute to
his memory with no wish to perform a mere perfunctory duty. Over
and above his intellect, his trained faculties, his knowledge, his wit, and
his power, he was an affectionate, loving, and lovable man, dear to all who
knew him. He is mourned not only by his friends, but by many who had
no personal acquaintance with him.
Resolved, That the Attorney-General be requested to lay these resolu-
tions before the court, and to ask that they be spread upon the record.
Resolved, That the chairman be requested to transmit a copy of them to
the family of Mr. Justice Lamar.

181
The Chief Justice responded:
The court receives with appreciation the tribute of the bar through the
Attorney-General to the memory of the eminent man who so recently
passed from its membership.
Although he was not spared to give many years to its labors, Mr.
Justice Lamar was long enough upon this bench to exhibit on a com-
paratively new field his undoubted intellectual power and to demonstrate
the possession of marked judicial qualities. The remarkable career which
preceded his appointment, crowded with varied incident and filled with
distinguished service in public station, while it withdrew him from that
active participation in professional practice which assures the habit of
prompt decision in ordinary litigation; nevertheless well prepared him for
the consideration of those grave public questions that so often press for
solution before this tribunal. Experience in affairs had made him sage,
and the wisdom thus acquired was aided by that "desire to seek, patience
to doubt, fondness to meditate, slowness to assert, readiness to reconsider,"
which the great philosopher declared fitted him for nothing so well as for
the study of truth. Such was indeed his nature, and leadership came to
him not merely by reason of his courage, his eloquence, his statesmanlike
views and general ability, but largely, perhaps chiefly, because of his sim-
plicity and single-mindedness, his integrity of thought as well as honesty
in action, and that unobtrusive and unselfish devotion to duty which gives
entrance to the kingdom that "cometh without observation."
There can be no better qualification for a great magistrate than, in ad-
dition to sufficient learning, to possess keen love of justice, earnest desire
for truth, absolute sincerity and the highest conception of the responsi-
bilities of public office, coupled with an intimate knowledge of the work-
ings of government obtained through practical experience.
Mr. Justice Lamar always underrated himself. This tendency plainly
sprang from a vivid imagination. With him the splendid visions attend-
ant upon youth never faded into the light of comnion day, but they kept
before him an ideal, the impossibility of whose realization, as borne in upon
him from time to time, oppressed him with a sense of failure. Yet the consci-
entiousness of his work was not lessened, nor was the acuteness of his intellect
obscured, by these natural causes of his discontent; nor did a certain Oriental
dreaminess of temperament ever lure him to abandon the effort to accom-
plish something that would last after his lips were dumb.
We fully recognize the fitness of the reference to the loving disposition
of our departed colleague. This especially endeared him to us, and it was
this which enabled him to bear with cheerfulness the trials of a long illness
and to find in the consolations of religion the peace that passeth all under-
standing.

182
Sincere in his support of a cause to which his early education and the
training of opening manhood, his surroundings and personal attachments,
committed him, his acceptance of the result of the arbitrament of arms was
genuine and unqualified; and the singular felicity was his, here having re-
turned to die at home at last, to appreciably contribute to the restoration
of the ties of common interest and affection of a united people; of pride
in common institutions and love for a common country; and to pass his
closing days in assisting in the authoritative exposition of the wonderful
instrument which binds together "the great contexture of this mysterious
whole."
The resolutions and accompanying remarks will be spread upon our
records, and the commemorative expressions of the bars of the State of
Georgia, of the State of Mississippi, and of the State of Illinois, and such
other similar testimonials as may be transmitted to us, will be placed on
file.
