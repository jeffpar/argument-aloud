"Mr. Attorney General, the court sorrows to learn of the death of
the great and conspicuous public servant whose services the country

The Chief Justice announced the following orders of the court:
No. 277. The Public Utilities Commission for the State of Kansas
et al., appellants, v. John M. Landon, as receiver of the Kansas Nat-
ural Gas Company et al.;
No. 329. Kansas City, Missouri, et al., appellants, v. John M.

Natural Gas Company et al.; and
No. 353. The Public Utilities Commission for the State of Kansas
et al., appellants, v. John M. Landon, as receiver, etc., et al. Ap-
peals from the District Court of the United States for the District
of Kansas. In these cases it is ordered that the decree entered
March 17, 1919, be vacated and decree now entered as follows: The
85736-19- -86

229
decrees below are reversed and the cause is remanded to the trial
court with directions to hear it anew and determine all the issues
involved, including those arising on the several bills, cross bills, and
answers in the nature of cross bills, in conformity with the views
expressed in the opinion of this court; and to take such further pro-
ceedings as may be appropriate and consistent with such opinion.
All temporary injunctions in force at the time of the entry of the
decrees from which appeals were taken here shall be continued in
force until otherwise ordered. The costs in this court will be paid
one-half by John M. Landon, receiver of the Kansas Natural Gas
Company, and the remainder shall be paid, one-third by each of
the three groups of appellants.
No., Original. Ex parte In the matter of J. A. Tracy, petitioner.
Motion for leave to renew application for writ of habeas corpus in
the United States District Court for the District of Colorado.
Memorandum for the Court by the Chief Justice. For the purpose
of redressing assumed violations of the Constitution and laws of the
United States by means of habeas corpus the jurisdiction of other
competent courts to afford relief may not be passed by and the
original jurisdiction of this court be invoked, in the absence of ex-
ceptional conditions justifying such course. (Matthews v. Ryan,
decided April 14, 1919). When leave to file the petition for habeas
corpus was previously denied, without a suggestion as to the ex-
istence of any exceptional condition which would have justified a
contrary view, such refusal presumably was based on the existence
of the right to seek, if desired, other and appropriate sources of
relief. From this it follows that although we pass the application
of the doctrine, that the refusal of a habeas corpus is not the thing
adjudged precluding a subsequent granting of such writ upon the
same facts, nevertheless there is here no reason to grant the order
prayed, since the previous order rested upon the right and duty to
petition for relief, if habeas corpus was desired to other and appro-
priate sources of judicial power. No reason therefore exists for
granting the order and to avoid any implication of a necessity which
does not obtain the order is denied.

of West Virginia. Motion for the appointment of receivers and of a
special master. The motion for the appointment of receivers and of
a special master is denied.
