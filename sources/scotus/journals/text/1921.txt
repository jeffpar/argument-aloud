No. 367. Liberty Oil Company, petitioner, v. The Condon Na-

No. 377. Ole Tolo, petitioner, v. Steamship Hannah Nielson, her
engines, etc.;
No. 381. Sioux City Bridge Company, petitioner, v. Dakota
County, Nebraska;
No. 434. Doo Fook, petitioner, v. The United States of America;
and
No. 435. Chan Wy Sheung, petitioner, v. The United States of
of America.
These were petitions for a rehearing of the dismissal of petitions
for certiorari which were not submitted to the Court in accordance
with the provision of Rule 37, par. 4, that "An application for a
writ of certiorari will be deemed in time when the petition therefor,
accompanied by the printed record and brief, is filed within the
period prescribed by law, provided this is followed by submitting
the petition in open court on some motion day not later than the
first one which follows a period of four weeks after such filing." It
has been made to appear to the satisfaction of the court that the

63
failure to submit these petitions at the proper time was due to a
misunderstanding as to the effect of the rule and an unwarranted
reliance upon the assumed practice of the clerk of his own motion
to present such petitions. The authority given by the rule to the
clerk to present the petitions at the request of counsel was for the
purpose of relieving counsel of the necessity of coming to court, fre-
quently from long distances, to make a formal motion. It was not,
however, intended to relax the requirement adopted to facilitate dis-
patch of business, that the petition should be presented on the motion
day fixed by the rule. By granting these motions the court does
not intend to relax the requirements of the rule, and suggests that
hereafter to avoid question requests made to the clerk to present
such petitions should be in writing. The applications in the fore-
going cases are severally granted, and the petitions will be restored
to the docket for consideration on their merits and considered as
submitted.

al., appellants, v. The Farmers Grain Company of Embden, North

Pitney, Mr. Justice McReynolds, Mr. Justice Brandeis, and Mr.

Samuel J. Flickinger, of Washington, D. C.; James Lane Dona-

City; Bernard L. Glover, of Kansas City, Mo.; Warren F. Martin,
of Philadelphia, Pa.; Lucius Everett Varney, of New York City;
and Ray Martin, of Columbus, Ohio, were admitted to practice.
Mr. Attorney General Daugherty presented to the Court the fol-
lowing resolutions:
Edward Douglass White, ninth Chief Justice of the United States,
was born in Thibadeaux, Lafourche Parish, State of Louisiana, on
the 3d day of November, 1845, and died in the city of Washington
on the 19th day of May, 1921.
When but 16 years of age, and yet at school, the Civil War broke
out. He thereupon laid aside his books, returned to his home, and,
as a private of infantry, espoused the cause of the Confederate
States.
After the close of the Civil War, he undertook the study of the
law, and in 1868 was admitted to practice at the Bar of the Supreme
Court of Louisiana.
In 1874, he was elected to the State Senate, in which body he
served for four years, when, by appointment, he became an associate
justice of the Supreme Court of Louisiana. He faithfully discharged
the duties of that office until the reorganization of the court in 1879,
when he resumed the practice of the law. On March 4, 1891, having
been elected by the Legislature of Louisiana, he assumed the office
of Senator of the United States, which he filled with distinction
until February 19, 1894.
By appointment of President Cleveland, and with the immediate
and unanimous consent of the Senate, he then became an Associate
Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.
Sixteen years of service as an Associate Justice so firmly estab-
lished his reputation and character as a jurist that, upon the death
69667-22-51

132
of Chief Justice Fuller, President Taft, himself a lawyer of distinc-
tion and of a different political party, commissioned him on Decem-
ber 12, 1910, Chief Justice of the United States.
On December 19, 1910, he assumed the central seat upon that
historic Bench, from which, with ability unsurpassed, he fulfilled
until his death the duties of his greatest office.
Of his 75 years of life, almost one-half was devoted to the public
good, six years in the service of his native State, and 30 years in
that of the Nation, which he served with singleness of purpose and
intensity of devotion.
As Associate Justice and Chief Justice, together, for 27 years,
he labored upon the Bench of this great court, and, by patience,
courtesy, and fullness of learning, combined with an exceptional
ability to grasp and correlate, not only intricate masses of detail,
but divergent systems of law, he constructed for himself, while
striving for the benefit of others, a monument as enduring as the
court itself.
What he said aptly of his immediate predecessor is applicable
precisely to himself: "His labors find an enduring memorial in the
reported decisions of the court rendered during the long period of
his service. * * They have become the heritage of his country-
men, for whose good he labored with untiring devotion."
*
It is accordingly
Resolved by the members of the Bar of the Supreme Court of the
United States here assembled, speaking for the membership of that
Bar at large and voicing the grief of their brethren throughout the
United States, That the services of the late Chief Justice constitute
a notable contribution to the achievements of the great tribunal of
which he was so long an illustrious member; that by his modest bear-
ing, his sense of kinship with his fellowmen, his wholesome outlook
upon life, and his vigorous support of American institutions and
ideals, no less than by the height of his intellect and the depth of his
learning, he has left to his countrymen a memory at once an ennob-
ling inspiration and a priceless example: It is further
Resolved, That the Attorney General of the United States be re-
quested to present these resolutions to the court and to move their in-
scription upon its records; and that the chairman of this meeting
send a copy of the resolutions to Mrs. White as an expression of the
sympathy of the American Bar.
May it please your honors: There is no higher virtue among any
people than the reverence in which it holds the memory of its illus-
trious dead. To commemorate the life of a man who has spent his
days in useful service to his country is not only a just tribute to him
but is distinctively an example for those who follow after him.

133
The richest heritage that any nation can have is the record of the
lives and services of its distinguished sons who have devoted them-
selves unselfishly and faithfully to the cause of their country. Such
lives furnish inspiration, give faith, point the way, and stimulate
others to useful service. Hence, it is deemed fitting that these reso-
lutions be presented to this court to commemorate the life and public
labors of its late Chief Justice, who for 27 years rendered most dis-
tinguished and useful service to his country as a Justice of the Su-
preme Court of the United States.
Edward Douglass White, late Chief Justice of the United States,
was born in La Fourche Parish, La., November 3, 1845. He died in
the city of Washington at 2 o'clock in the morning on May 19, 1921.
He was a soldier in the Confederate Army at the age of 16, entering
in 1861; was taken prisoner at the fall of Port Hudson July 6,
1863; received his education at Mount Saint Mary's College, near
Emmittsburg, Md.; at the Jesuit College, New Orleans, La., and at
Georgetown University, Washington, D. C. He was admitted to
the Louisiana bar in 1868 and immediately manifested an active
interest in politics. He was elected to the State Senate of Louis-
iana in 1874, and was later appointed an Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court of Louisiana in 1878 at the age of 33. After serving
with distinction and ability in this capacity he relinquished public
office to resume the practice of law. For a time he was chairman of
the board of examiners for admission to the bar of Louisiana and
was also a member of the board of administrators of Tulane Uni-
versity, of New Orleans.
The high order of ability which he manifested while associate
justice upon the Louisiana supreme bench, and the courageous and
able fight which he made for clean government in Louisiana, and
especially on account of his efforts against the Louisiana State Lot-
tery, which finally resulted in ridding the State of this evil, so im-
pressed the people of that State that he was elected to a seat in the
United States Senate, commencing his term March 4, 1891.
His call, however, was to judicial and not to legislative service,
for upon February 19, 1894, in the forty-ninth year of his age,
President Cleveland appointed him an Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court of the United States, and he took the oath of office
on March 12 of that year.
After a service of nearly 17 years as an Associate Justice upon
the Supreme Bench, during which time he displayed such marked
ability that, as a recognition for eminent attainments and special
fitness for this office, he received the crowning reward of all judicial
service in this Government and was appointed Chief Justice of the
United States by President Taft December 12, 1910, at the age of

134
65, and took the oath on December 19, 1910, thereby succeeding
Chief Justice Fuller as the ninth man to be appointed to this high
office. Such, in brief, is the outline of the facts of the life and public
service of the late Chief Justice.
Chief Justice White came to the Supreme Court of the United
States a profound lawyer, an able jurist and statesman in the prime
of life, the then youngest member of that body, with the full
measure of physical strength, intellectual and moral endowment,
and practical experience both as a lawyer and a statesman in public
affairs, and was destined soon to take a leading place upon that
bench.
No greater eulogy can be pronounced upon Chief Justice White
than to say that as Associate Justice for nearly 17 years, and later
as Chief Justice for more than 10 years, he responded in full meas-
ure to the requirements of that high office.
To be Chief Justice of the United States is the highest judicial
honor in this country-in fact, in many ways it is the crowning honor
that can come to any lawyer in the Nation-for in our whole his-
tory only 10 men have occupied this position. Chief Justice White
received this honor. He served his country well, and his memory
is entitled to the reverence of a grateful Nation.
The Supreme Court of the United States occupies a unique posi-
tion in the political science of the world; in fact, it was our chief
original contribution to the science of government. It is not only
like the courts of last resort of other nations in that it makes deci-
sions upon juristic questions, but it exercises the additional function
of declaring laws, in proper cases, unconstitutional.
Great as is our debt to the fathers who gave us the Constitution,
it may still be questioned whether the work of Hamilton, Madison,
and other constitutional fathers would have been complete had not
that long train of men from Marshall to White interpreted it and
told us what it meant.
This court has maintained its place not by force but by the power
of logical reasoning, clear thinking, careful analysis, masterly argu-
ment, moral rectitude, and statesman-like vision to see and to under-
stand. The people, through the work of this court, have come to
realize what their Government is.
The function of the Supreme Court of the United States is of
vital importance. It is the anchor which holds us to constitutional
government, the ever-watchful guardian of the liberties of the peo-
ple against transgression by legislative or executive action, the bal-
ance wheel holding in equipoise and true relationship the various
parts of our complex system. What higher or more noble work has
ever been committed to the heart and hand and mind of man?

135
Chief Justice White was deeply conscious of the great responsi-
bility devolving upon this court. He realized fully the transcendent
importance of its function and place in our system of government.
He gave unreservedly all the power of his mighty intellect to up-
holding its dignity, its traditions, and its usefulness.
It has often occurred to me, and especially in studying the life
of Chief Justice White, that this court furnishes the most inspiring
example of service, full, without stint, unselfishly given to the Na-
tion. In this respect, men far past the age when they might retire
steadfastly remain at their posts. Chief Justice White for 27 years
labored faithfully in his work and died at his post in the service of
his country. In this day, when men dare to scoff at the Constitution,
when many prefer ease to the service of their country, when the
whole world seems to have lost its balance and is in turmoil, it is
indeed an inspiring hope to contemplate the lives and service of the
men who have occupied this Bench. They furnish encouragement
to those of us who believe in the Constitution, in our country, and in
its destiny.
The period of Chief Justice White marked a great era for the
Supreme Court of the United States. In the 30 years between the
Civil War and the advent of Chief Justice White to the Bench, the
Nation, by leaps and bounds, entered upon an era of industrial and
commercial development unparalleled in the history of the world.
This brought new problems.
As to the opinions written by Chief Justice White it may be said
that it would be a very inadequate and therefore futile tribute to him
to present in digest form the points decided in a few of the more
than 700 masterly opinions that he wrote. Certain common char-
acteristics run through all of these opinions. They bear evi-
dence of a profound legal mind, painstaking investigation, a wealth
of knowledge, a statesman-like vision to see the probable conse-
quences resulting from such decision, and, above all, an intense be-
lief in our constitutional system of government.
In all the work of the court during this period Chief Justice
White performed his full share. The record of his judicial labors is
contained in 103 volumes of the opinions of this court, as found in
volumes 153-255, inclusive. During his incumbency upon the Su-
› preme Bench the court disposed of, in one way or another, more than
$ 14,000 cases, and rendered opinions in more than 7,000 cases. Chief
Justice White wrote about 700 opinions for the court, 10 concurring
opinions, and 33 dissenting opinions. These opinions cover the whole
range of the work of the court during this era. He was no specialist
in that he confined his labors to any one particular field of work.
On the contrary, his range of work was general and covered the
main fields of litigation that came before the court.

136
The first opinion that Chief Justice White wrote on any great
constitutional question was a dissent in the case of Pollock v.
Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. (157 U. S., 429), decided April 8,
1895. This opinion, delivered the first year after he came upon
the Bench is a prophecy of the high rank he was to take as a jurist
upon that Bench. In this first dissenting opinion he shows the
characteristics as a jurist that followed him through his entire
judicial career. The question before the court was whether a tax
by the Federal Government under the revenue law of 1894 upon
certain incomes was a direct tax and therefore repugnant to the
provisions of the Constitution requiring direct taxes to be levied
according to the rule of apportionment.
A respect for precedent and a firm adherence to the doctrine of
stare decisis are evidenced in this first opinion. After reviewing
the history of all the cases from the beginning of the Government,
showing that direct taxes within the meaning of the Constitution
included only taxes on land and capitation taxes, he said:
"And now, after a hundred years, after long-continued action by
other departments of the Government, and after repeated adjudi-
cations of this court, this interpretation is overthrown, and the
Congress is declared not to have a power of taxation which may
at some time, as it has in the past, prove necessary to the very
existence of the Government." (157 U. S., 637.)
In this case Chief Justice White goes back of juristic arguments
and reveals his political philosophy with reference to the doctrine of
precedent and the sound reasons and principles upon which it is
based. He takes the position that the Supreme Court is intended
to be a stabilizing agency in making for certainty, uniformity, and
fixedness of judicial decision, and says further that—
"
Break down this belief in judicial continuity, and let it be felt
that on great constitutional questions this court is to depart from
the settled conclusions of its predecessors, and to determine them
all according to the mere opinion of those who temporarily fill its
bench, and our Constitution will, in my judgment, be bereft of value
and become a most dangerous instrument to the rights and liberties
of the people."
This opinion also reveals another favorite method of legal
analysis of Chief Justice White; that is, to test the soundness of
any decision by following its effect to its logical consequence. This,
it may be said with assurance, is one of the highest characteristics
that any jurist can have who occupies a place in the Supreme Court
of the United States. Again and again, running through the
opinions of Chief Justice White is the principle that the statesman-
jurist will not plant himself upon a decision that works ill in its

137
ultimate results if he can find a ground that will work beneficially.
On this point in the Pollock case he said:
"The injustice of the conclusion points to the error of adopting
it. **A rule which works out this result, which, it seems.
to me, stultifies the Constitution by making it an instrument of the
most grievous wrong, should not be adopted, especially when, in
order to do so, the decisions of this court, the opinions of the law
writers and publicists, tradition, practice, and the settled policy of
the Government must be overthrown." (158 U. S., 712.)
Closely akin to this last characteristic method, his argument on
this point is that to limit or to deny to Congress the power of
direct taxation, as in this case, would mean that the Nation would
no longer be supreme, but would be at the mercy of the State govern-
ments. He concludes this point by saying:
"
Hence, the decision now rendered, so far as taxing real and per-
sonal property and invested wealth is concerned, reduces the Gov-
ernment of the United States to the paralyzed condition which ex-
isted under the Confederation, and to remove which the Constitution
of the United States was adopted." (158 U. S., 714–715.)
This opinion also gives the prophecy that Chief Justice White was
a nationalist in political theory, believing and advocating that the
☐ National Government should be endowed with every power for its
own functioning and should not be dependent upon the States to
supply funds for conducting the Government. Here we see the
soldier of the Confederacy, the idol of his native State, born and
reared and steeped in the political philosophy of States rights, de-
veloping in majestic splendor, and when the hour came for him
under the responsibility of office, with broadening vision, we see him
take his place as a worthy successor to Marshall as an apostle of
nationalism. He protested against any decision in this case that
would enfeeble the National Government and make it a helpless
prey to the whim or caprice of the States. He lived to see the
triumph of these views. After a lapse of 21 years they became the
law of the land by the sixteenth amendment to the Constitution.
That he fully realized this is seen from the statement in the case of
Brushaber v. Union Pacific Railroad Company (240 U. S., 1), in
which the income-tax provisions of the tariff act of 1913 were before
the court. Rendering the opinion, he said:
"Indeed, in the light of the history which we have given and of
the decision in the Pollock Case and the ground upon which the rul-
ing in that case was based, there is no escape from the conclusion
that the amendment was drawn for the purpose of doing away for
the future with the principle upon which the Pollock Case was de-
cided * * * " (240 U. S., 18.)

138
Another opinion especially important in illustrating the charac-
teristics of Chief Justice White as a jurist is that of Knowlton v.
Moore (178 U. S., 41), decided May 14, 1900. The main question
involved in this case was whether a tax upon legacies under the war
revenue act of 1898 was a direct tax, and therefore subject to appor-
tionment, or whether indirect, and therefore in violation of the rule
of uniformity. Chief Justice White reviewed the inheritance tax
laws of Rome and other ancient nations and the modern law of
France and other continental countries, as well as those of England
and her colonies, and declared that an examination of all shows that-
"Tax laws of this nature in all countries rest in their essence upon
the principle that death is the generating source from which the par-
ticular taxing power takes its being and that it is the power to trans-
mit, or the transmission from the dead to the living, on which such
taxes are more immediately rested." (178 U. S., 56.)
Hence, the opinion held that the tax levied was upon the right to
inherit and not upon the property itself. Being a tax upon the right
instead of upon the property, it was in the nature of an excise tax,
and hence indirect. For wealth of learning, thorough familiarity
with the literature of the subject-economic, historical, and juris-
tic-the discussion of Chief Justice White in this opinion has few
superiors in our American jurisprudence. It is a genuine contri-
bution to the jurisprudence of our country on the subject of taxation
with reference to the devolution of property by inheritance or will.
It fully vindicates and demonstrates the value of the study of com-
parative jurisprudence. Chief Justice White, profoundly learned
in the jurisprudence of ancient and modern times, with a wealth of
comparative knowledge of the civil as well as the common law, was
able to bring his civil-law knowledge to bear as the handmaid to
assist the common law when necessary, but was wise and judicious
enough never, in a pedantic way, to force the discussion of the civil
law in his opinions unless it was necessary and vitally contributive
as an aid to the development of his subject.
Neither the time nor the occasion permits an extended discussion
of the insular cases. In working out the problems incident to these
cases Chief Justice White made his full contribution of labor, of
thought, and of learning. Starting as a dissenter, his views and
those of others associated with him finally prevailed and became the
rule of law for the court, and in the last of these cases (Rasmussen
v. United States, 187 U. S., 516) he was able to write the opinion, re-
affirming the views that he and his associates had held from the be-
ginning, for the majority of the court.
Among the most famous of the opinions of Chief Justice White
are those defining the powers of Congress under the commerce clause

139
of the Constitution and legislation thereunder, such as the Sherman
Antitrust act of July 2, 1890, in which opinions the so-called rule
of reason was announced. His position on this subject first occurs in
a dissenting opinion in the case of United States v. Trans-Missouri
Freight Association (166 U. S., 290), delivered in 1896. The court
had occasion to consider this subject in other cases during the suc-
ceeding 14 years, and the attitude of the court on this question was
such that at the end of this interval the Chief Justice was able to
write the opinion for the court, in 1910, in the case of Standard Oil
Company v. United States (221 U. S., 1) and in the case of United
States v. American Tobacco Company (221 U. S., 106). Speaking
for the court, he said:
66
,
Applying the rule of reason to the construction of the statute,
it was held in the Standard Oil case that as the words 'restraint of
trade at common law and in the law of this country at the time
of the adoption of the antitrust act only embraced acts or contracts
or agreements or combinations which operated to the prejudice of
the public interests by unduly restricting competition or unduly ob-
structing the due course of trade, or which, either because of their
inherent nature or effect or because of the evident purpose of the
acts, etc., injuriously restrained trade, that the words as used in the
statute were designed to have and did have but a like significance."
(221 U. S., 179.)
Chief Justice White never permitted economic theory to domi-
nate his views of constitutional law. This is shown in the Pollock
case, where he stood for the historic definition of the fathers as to
direct taxes rather than to accept the definition as given by the
economists in 1895. Likewise, he held his social and political philos-
ophy subordinate to his juristic views of the Constitution. He did
not believe that because legislation was desirable it was therefore
constitutional. He should not, however, for this reason, be classed
as opposed to progress and as opposed to an interpretation of the
Constitution as a living vital organism adapted to twentieth century
needs. A careful study of the two cases, Lochner v. New York
(198 U. S., 45) and Hammer v. Dagenhart (247 U. S., 251), as
types of many other similar cases, will show that his position must
be explained upon the theory of constitutional law and not upon
any theory of social philosophy. He supported social welfare legis-
lation by the States in the exercise of their police power. He op-
posed any definite enlarging the power of Congress to regulate
commerce or any other power of the Federal Constitution to enact
similar legislation, where such legislation, as he thought, was an
exercise of the police power reserved to the States.

140
Closely akin to this subject it may be said that he was no extreme
advocate of absolute liberty, either of person or of contract, nor
did he believe in the unnecessary extension of governmental control
over individuals. In an address before the American Bar Associa-
tion at Montreal, Canada, in 1913, introducing the lord high chan-
cellor of Great Britain, after epitomizing the experiences of Roman
government and the history of the development of jurisprudence as
illuminated by the teachings of Christianity, he said:
"When analyzed, these conceptions give the clearest apprehension
of the rudimentary truths underlying all constitutional systems of
government, and demonstrate that mere questions of municipal law
are of minor importance when compared with the fundamental con-
siderations which are at the basis of the preservation of free insti-
tutions; that is, the conservatism which is necessary to conserve
representative government, the willingness of one to submit to such
restraints upon his own conduct as are essential to the preservation
of the rights of all. In other words, the power of a free people
to restrain themselves in order that freedom may endure."
Chief Justice White was a believer in the Constitution, yet he
saw the dangers resulting from an abuse of the Constitution by
those who seek to invoke it through the agency of our judiciary for
their own purposes as against the legitimate rights of all the people.
In an address delivered before the American Bar Association in
this city, in October, 1914, he said:
"There is great danger, it seems to me, to arise from the constant
habit which prevails where anything is opposed or objected to, of
resorting without rhyme or reason to the Constitution as a means
of preventing its accomplishment, thus creating the general impres-
sion that the Constitution is but a barrier to progress instead of
being the broad highway through which alone true progress may
be enjoyed."
Nature was kind to Chief Justice White. The elements were so
mixed in him that he was destined to be one of earth's noblemen.
His profound mind in all its manifestations was supplemented by a
largeness of personality and of life. He was a man of dignity, yet
his dignity was a natural manifestation of a great soul rather than
of any conscious effort. He had the modesty, the simplicity, and the
tenderness of a child, yet a firmness and courage that made him a
power in any cause in which he believed. He was no egotist. In
everything that he has written about himself, as well as in his per-
sonal demeanor, there is a significant absence of anything that would
bear the impress of self-glorification. He was considerateness itself
for those about him. To the members of the court, to the members
of the bar, to all with whom he came in contact, whether rich or
poor or of high or low degree, he manifested a kindly, considerate

141
spirit. He was courteous and polite, but he was far more than polite.
Courtesy and politeness are sometimes formal rules of conduct. In
him they were the outward expression of a nature that loved human
fellowship. High official position, great learning, raised no impulse
of false pride in him. He was deeply conscious of the great obliga-
tions that power brought with it. With a keen sense of responsibil-
ity he cheerfully set forth for the accomplishment of his work and
humbly fashioned his life to render service. He was humble, yet his
humility was not that superficial deference that one man formally
pays to another. His great mind had penetrated far enough into
spiritual things to understand the smallness of man in the infinite
purpose of God. Of him it could truly be said that his purpose was
to do justice, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with his God. He
had the true humanitarian spirit. He loved his fellowman. Those
who came in contact with him felt the radiance of his nature, and men
everywhere loved him. Such a nature as his must have been the in-
spiration of Lowell when he wrote those beautiful lines containing
life's truest philosophy:
Be noble and the nobleness that lies
In other men, sleeping but never dead,
Will rise in majesty to meet thine own.
All these qualities of personal endowment, together with a tact
and skill in his relationship to those about him, rarely equaled. com-
bined to make him a leader of men. As leader of this court he will
rank among the great Chief Justices-certainly the equal of any
since the days of Marshall.
In closing I can described this great statesman and gifted jurist
in no better way than to use his own eloquent words. Speaking on a
similar occasion of one of his colleagues on the Bench—Mr. Justice
Lamar-he said:
"O true American and devoted public servant, O cherished friend
and faithful comrade, O sweet and noble soul, may it be vouchsa fed
that the results of your work may endure and fructify for the preser-
vation of the rights of mankind, and may there be given to us who
remain, wiping from our eyes the mists begotten of your loss, to see
that through the mercy of the inscrutable providence of God you
have been called to rest and to your exceeding reward!"
The Chief Justice responded:
Mr. Attorney General, the resolutions of the Bar and the words
in which you present them are an appropriate expression of the
inestimable loss which the people of this country and the members
of the Bar feel in the death of Chief Justice White. Expressions
of sympathy and appreciation of his high standing as a jurist be-

142
fore the world from the lord chancellor of England and the Bar
of that country have been forwarded to the court and will be pre-
served in its records.
Twenty-seven years of service upon this Bench, 16 years as an
Associate Justice and 11 years as head of the court, make Chief
Justice White's record nearly equal to that of John Marshall. The
critical period covered by the span of so many years, beginning
early in the last decade of one century and extending into the third
of the next, likens itself in importance to that covered by the term
of the great interpreter of the Constitution. It embraced two wars.
and a period of social and business reforms involving substantial
and necessary changes in our methods of government, with the ap-
plication of which this court has had much to do. In the necessary
adjustment, the opinions of Chief Justice White were most able
and helpful contributions.
The enormous material expansion of the latter half of the nine-
teenth century developed a corporate power and political control
through wealth which threatened the welfare of the Republic, and
the abuses then existing led to the enactment of most far-reaching
remedial legislation.
The antitrust act directed toward dangerous restraints of trade
and monopolies, necessarily couched in words of general import, re-
quired the adjudication of this court to interpret its meaning and
apply the remedies to the evil which its framers had in mind.
The interpretation of the Sherman Act by Chief Justice White,
in his opinion in the Standard Oil case, is monumental and the most
satisfactory exposition of its purpose and scope in the books.
Of the same period and responding to the same popular impulse
was the income tax, and the great difference of opinion in this court
as to its constitutionality was followed by a popular reversal of the
judgment of the majority through constitutional means. Mr. Jus-
tice White was one of the minority in that case, and it remained for
him as Chief Justice, speaking for a unanimous court, to interpret
the amendment which made the opinion of the minority the funda-
mental law.
The capital importance which our railroad system has come to
have in the welfare of this country made the judicial construction
of the interstate commerce act of critical moment. It is not too
much to say that Chief Justice White in construing the measure
and its great amendments has had more to do with placing this
vital part of our practical government on a useful basis than any
other judge. His opinions in the case of the Texas & Pacific Rail-
way Co. v. The Abilene Cotton Oil Co., and the cases which fol-
lowed it, are models of clear and satisfactory reasoning which gave

143
to the people, to State legislatures, to Congress, and the courts a
much-needed knowledge of the practical functions the Commerce
Commission was to discharge, and of how they were to be recon-
ciled to existing governmental machinery, for the vindication of
the rights of the public in respect of national transportation. They
are a conspicuous instance of his unusual and remarkable power and
facility in statesmanlike interpretation of statute law.
The Interstate Commerce Commission was authorized to exercise
powers the conferring of which by Congress would have been, per-
haps, thought in the earlier years of the Republic to violate the
rule that no legislative power can be delegated. But the inevitable
progress and exigencies of government and the utter inability of
Congress to give the time and attention indispensable to the exer-
cise of these powers in detail forced the modification of the rule.
Similar necessity caused Congress to create other bodies with anal-
ogous relations to the existing legislative, executive, and judicial
machinery of the Federal Government, and these in due course came
under the examination of this court. Here was a new field of ad-
ministrative law which needed a knowledge of government and an
experienced understanding of our institutions safely to define and
declare. The pioneer work of Chief Justice White in this field
entitles him to the gratitude of his countrymen.
The chief question presented by the Spanish War was the applica-
tion of the Constitution to the new possessions of the Government.
We were to administer them for the benefit of their peoples of races
alien to ours and with but little understanding of our free institu-
tions. Was there elasticity enough in our governmental structure
to permit this to be done with the application of specific constitu-
tional guaranties of liberty sacred to the traditions of our people,
but dangerous and impracticable in a society untrained in their use?
After much difference of opinion between the members of the
court, the distinction in the rigid application of these guaranties
as between territory acquired by the United States and belonging to
it, and territory thereafter incorporated by Congress into the Union,
originally insisted on by Mr. Justice White, became the settled opin-
ion of the court and the law of the land. It enabled our Govern-
ment to do a beneficent colonial work for retarded peoples. The
once genuine fear of imperialistic tendency from the distinction has
faded away.
The enlargement of the national governmental functions by the
use of the regulatory power over commerce among the States, in
the lottery statute, the pure food act, the white slave act, and other
measures, a power which in these forms of exercise had lain dormant
since the beginning of the Government, was actively employed to

144
suppress growing evils. All presented new remedial legislation re-
quiring accurate construction with a view to keeping within the
limits fixed by the fundamental law on the one hand, and giving
effect to their beneficent purpose on the other. Here, too, the genius
of Chief Justice White as a statesman and a jurist shone forth.
In the World War his opinions supporting statutes enacted to
enable the Government to carry on the struggle, to mass all its
resources of men and money in the country's defense, and to restrain
sinister efforts to obstruct it reveal an intense patriotic appreciation
of the necessity of vesting full powers in the Nation when its in-
tegrity is threatened and of the existence of ample authority to this
end in the Constitution. The Chief Justice, in the Selective Draft
case, delivered one of his great opinions.
Any association with Chief Justice White left no doubt of the
force and strength of his convictions. Massive, dignified, impressive
as was his physical mould, his mental structure was like it. There
is an indefinable something about a leader of men that we call “per-
sonality," difficult to define, but which makes itself felt wherever
they are. This quality Chief Justice White had in a marked degree.
In the settlement of every issue he had to be reckoned with. With
lofty ideals as a statesman, with profound learning, with a love of
logical processes and of the manifestation of them in his exposition
of his views he drove home his conclusion with a confidence and a
convincing assurance that distinguishes his judicial expression.
His capacity for work was enormous. During his service on the
bench the court disposed in one way or another of 13,000 cases,
and he himself prepared more than 800 opinions for the court. The
number of opinions is usually made the measure of a judge's work,
but it is only a part of it. The study of cases with a view to their
decision in conference is the greater task, and this varies with the
individual judge and with his conscience and feeling of responsi-
bility. No one could be more sensitive in this regard than Chief
Justice White. He carried for 11 years the additional burden of the
executive direction of the court. In his later years he did his work
with the burden of growing physical defects entailing obstacle and
suffering, which he refused to betray and to which he would not
yield. His whole being was absorbed by his anxious concern for the
maintenance of the prestige of the court in the preservation of the
Constitution and the upholding of its principles. He took infinite
pains even in the lesser details of his duties. He regarded his office
as a sacred trust, as a Holy Grail, which awakened an intense scrutiny
of his own conduct and of that of every member of the court.
Of the story of his life, which began as a soldier of the Confed-
eracy at 16 years, and the quick recognition of his power for useful-
ness from his early professional beginnings until by noteworthy steps

145
he reached this Bench, there is not time to speak. His leadership of
the long but successful fight against the lottery evil in Louisiana
showed how formidable he was in organization and how courageous
in action. His power as a speaker was only revealed in later years
by the few addresses he was induced reluctantly to make to the
American Bar Association. At Montreal and Washington his hearers
were captivated by the grace and fluency of his diction, the exquisite
charm, dignity, and force of his bearing, and the depth of his ex-
pressed conviction. His touching metaphor to illustrate his own
change of heart toward "Old Glory," of the fading of the gray of
the Confederacy into the blue of the Union, "the invisible blue" as
he adapted it from the moving story of the Cricket on the Hearth.
will never fade from the memory of those who were privileged to
hear him.
Edward Douglass White was the exemplary citizen, the considerate
neighbor and friend, and the loving husband. He had a great heart,
full of sympathy for mankind. He had an unfailing courtesy and a
sweetness of manner which endeared him to all with whom he was
associated. The strength and ruggedness and dignity of his charac-
ter were stamped in his face, and these things but lent a peculiar
charm to his gentleness and kindly manner. He was a gentleman of
the old school.
Of his personal relations to the members of the court in the inti-
macy of conference, I can not, of course, speak from personal
experience. They are shown in the touching words in which, imme-
diately after his death, the senior Associate Justice of this court, so
long a loved and loving comrade in service with Chief Justice White,
expressed the affectionate esteem in which the colleagues of this
great Chief Justice held him. In closing this response for the court
to these resolutions, I can best express their estimate of his judicial
work by quoting Mr. Justice McKenna when he said:
"Anticipating the future, I see no shadow on his fame or service.
I venture to make comparisons. I make full concession of the
recognized and distinguished merit of those who preceded him. I
make full admission in assured prophecy of the ability of those who
will succeed him, yet considering his qualities, their variety and de-
gree, and estimating them, I dare to say that he will forever keep a
distinct eminence among the Chief Justices of the United States."
The resolutions and the accompanying remarks will be entered
upon the records of the court.
