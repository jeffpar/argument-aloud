Inc., 352 U. S. 521; Shaw v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 353 U. S. 920;
Futrelle v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 353 U. S. 920; Deen v. Gulf,

hiser v. Chesapeake & O. R. Co., 354 U. S. 901; McBride v. Toledo
Terminal R. Co., 354 U. S. 517. For the reasons set forth in his
opinion in Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 500, 524,
Mr. Justice Frankfurter is of the view that the writ of certiorari is
improvidently granted.
No. 350. Pasquale Palermo, petitioner, v. Luckenbach Steamship
Company, Inc. On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Per Curiam: The petition
for certiorari is granted, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals
is reversed and the case is remanded. We hold that the trial court
did not commit reversible error in refusing to charge respondent's
request No. 12. The petitioner's alleged choice of a more dangerous
route did not, under the proofs, operate to bar recovery as a matter
of law. The jury was properly instructed that the petitioner's negli-
gence, if any, was to be considered in mitigation of damages under
the rule applicable in actions for personal injuries arising from
maritime torts. Pope & Talbot, Inc. v. Hawn, 346 U. S. 406, 408-409;
cf. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co. v. Smith, 305 U. S. 424. For reasons set
forth in his opinion in Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U. S. 500,
524, Mr. Justice Frankfurter is of the view that the writ of certiorari
is improvidently granted.
No. 142. Jay Lee Gibson, petitioner, v. Guy A. Thompson, Trustee,
New Orleans, Texas & Mexico Railway Company; and
No. 350. Pasquale Palermo, petitioner, v. Luckenbach Steamship
Company, Inc. Memorandum of Mr. Justice Harlan, with whom
Mr. Justice Burton and Mr. Justice Whittaker join. For reasons
elaborated by Mr. Justice Frankfurter at the last Term, 352 U. S. 524,
I think that certiorari should have been denied in each of these cases.
However, I continue in the view, expressed at the last Term, 352 U. S.
559, that once certiorari has been granted in such cases, we disbelievers,
consistent with the Court's certiorari procedure, should consider them
on the merits. Further, much as I disagree, 352 U. S. 559, 562–564,
with the reasoning and philosophy of the Rogers case, which strips

the historic role of the judge in a jury trial of all meaningful sig-
nificance, I feel presently bound to bow to it. Applying Rogers to the
present cases, I am forced to concur in judgments of reversal in Nos.
142 and 350.
No. 355. Charles C. Hobart, Father and Next Friend of Elizabeth
Beatrice Hobart, appellant, v. Rachel Elizabeth Hobart. Appeal
from the Supreme Court of Ohio. Per Curiam: The motion to dis-
miss is granted and the appeal is dismissed. Treating the papers
whereon the appeal was taken as a petition for writ of certiorari,
certiorari is denied.

No. 519. Luther Thomas Lambert et al., appellants, v. United
States of America et al. Appeals from the United States District
Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. Per Curiam: The mo-
tions to affirm are granted and the judgment is affirmed.
No. 405. John W. Turner, Jr., appellant, v. Warren E. Wright,
Treasurer of the State of Illinois, and Richard J. Lyons, Director of
the Department of Revenue of the State of Illinois;
No. 470. Abbate Brothers, Inc., et al., appellants, v. The City of
Chicago, a Municipal Corporation; and
No. 482. Burgess-Norton Mfg. Co., appellant, v. Richard J. Lyons
et al. Appeals from the Supreme Court of Illinois. Per Curiam:
The motions to dismiss are granted and the appeals are dismissed for
want of a substantial federal question.
No. 58. Lee You Fee, by Lee Q. Pon, His Next Friend, petitioner,
v. John Foster Dulles, Secretary of State. On writ of certiorari to
the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Per
Curiam: Upon consideration of the confession of error by the
Solicitor General and of the entire record, the judgment of the United
States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is reversed and the
case is remanded to the District Court with directions to vacate its
order dismissing the complaint.
No. 442. Mildred S. Stinson, as Administratrix of the Estate of
A. Bruce Stinson, Deceased, Suing as such Administratix, petitioner, v.
Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company. On petition for writ of cer-
tiorari to the Supreme Court of Alabama. Per Curiam: The petition
for writ of certiorari is granted. The Supreme Court of Alabama
held that "there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that there
was negligence on the part of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Com-
pany." 264 Ala. 522, 527, 88 So. 2d 189, 193. We agree. We now
hold that the evidence also presented a jury question whether the em-
ployee's death resulted in whole or in part from such negligence. 35
Stat. 65, 45 U. S. C. Sec. 51; Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352
U.S. 500; Schulz v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 350 U. S. 523. The judgment
of the Supreme Court of Alabama is therefore reversed and the cause
is remanded for consideration of any grounds not disposed of on the
first appeal; and, if none has merit, with instructions to reinstate
the judgment entered on the jury verdict of June 12, 1953, awarding
the petitioner damages of $46,600. Urie v. Thompson, 337 U. S. 163.
For the reasons set forth in his opinion in Rogers v. Missouri Pacific
R. Co., 352 U. S. 500, 524, Mr. Justice Frankfurter is of the view that
the writ of certiorari is improvidently granted. Mr. Justice Burton
dissents. Mr. Justice Harlan, while believing that certiorari should
be denied, considers that Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., supra,
requires him to concur in the result.

No. 477. American Public Power Association, the City of James-
town, New York, et al., petitioners, v. Power Authority of the State
of New York. On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Per Curiam:

dismiss the petition upon the ground that the cause is moot.

tion for leave to file petition for writ of mandamus or in the alterna-
tive prohibition and mandamus. Per Curiam: It appearing that this
case has become moot, the rule to show cause is discharged and the
motion for leave to file petition for writ of mandamus or in the alter-
native prohibition and mandamus is denied. Separate memorandum
by Mr. Justice Frankfurter, in which Mr. Justice Brennan joins, has

randum.

of the Supreme Court of Louisiana on September 25, 1957, in Poret v.
Sigler and Poret v. Louisiana, Nos. 269 and 270, Misc., O. T. 1957,
certiorari denied this day, the judgments heretofore entered are
vacated, and the cause is remanded to the District Court for considera-
tion of the application for habeas corpus. The stay heretofore entered
is continued in effect until final disposition of the case in the District
Court.
No. 275, Misc. In the Matter of Marshall Lamkin, petitioner. On
petition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Criminal Appeals of
Texas. Per Curiam: The petition for writ of certiorari is denied.
The judgment below rests on an adequate state ground since peti-
tioner, in filing his application for habeas corpus in the state court,
failed to comply with applicable state procedures. See Fox Film
Corp. v. Muller, 296 U. S. 207 (1935). The stay heretofore entered
is continued through December 18, 1957, to afford petitioner an oppor-
tunity to file with due diligence a proper application for relief in the
appropriate state court, and in the event of a final denial of same in
the highest court of the state, to renew in this Court an application
for writ of certiorari. See Tenner v. Dullea, 314 U. S. 692 (1941).

The Chief Justice announced the following order of the Court:
No. 451. Solomon P. Rosenbloom, also known as Sol Rosenbloom,
petitioner, v. United States of America. On petition for writ of
certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth
Circuit.
Per Curiam: The petition for a writ of certiorari is granted. The
Court of Appeals has held, without opinion, that petitioner's notice
of appeal from the District Court, filed on July 8, 1957, was un-
timely. The Government has conceded that the Clerk of the District
Court did not mail to petitioner or his attorney a notice of the entry
of the order of June 14 denying petitioner's motion for a new trial
and judgment of acquittal, as required by Rule 49 (c), Federal Rules
of Criminal Procedure. In our opinion the record in this case fails
to show with sufficient certainty that petitioner or his attorney had
actual notice of the entry of that order by reason of the procedings
which took place in the District Court on June 14.* Cf. Huff v.
United States, 192 F. 2d 911; Gonzalez v. United States, 233 F. 2d
825, 827, reversed on other grounds, 352 U. S. 978. What transpired
at those proceedings is too ambiguous to permit the conclusion that pe-
titioner and his attorney were not justified in believing that petition-
er's time to appeal would begin to run on July 8. In these circum-
stances we think that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that pe-
titioner's notice of appeal was untimely. Rule 37 (a) (2), Fed.
Rules Crim. Proc.; see Carter v. United States, 168 F. 2d 310. The
judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is re-
manded to that court for further proceedings consistent with this
opinion.
Mr. Justice Burton, with whom Mr. Justice Clark concurs,
dissenting.
Petitioner was present in open court with his attorney at the time
the court overruled his motion for a new trial. He thus had actual
notice of the denial of his motion and was not entitled to rely upon
an additional notice in writing from the clerk to the same effect.
The colloquy quoted by the Court took place later, "after calling
*The record shows the following:
""The COURT. * * *
*
"Do you want some time for your client before he turns in?
"Mr. SHAW. Your Honor, I was going to ask for some time in which to get his affairs
straightened out, and within which to file an appeal, should we so desire to do.
"The COURT. Very well. If you file an appeal, of course, if you apply for bond, I will
tell you now that I will grant you bond. Be permitted to go under the bond you are under
now. How much time do you want?
"Mr. SHAW. About two weeks, your Honor.
"The COURT. How about Monday, July 1st, or do you want it the 8th, the following
Monday?
"Mr. SHAW. That will be all right.
"The COURT. Be given until July 8th.
"Mr. SHAW. Thank you."

other motions in other cases." At that time this case "was again
called by the Judge and the proceedings as indicated in the transcript
of the official Court reporter took place." Especially in the light of
the time interval between the denial of the motion and the colloquy
quoted in the opinion, I believe the Court of Appeals was justified
in concluding that petitioner's counsel should have understood that
his motion had been denied on June 14.
The Chief Justice said:
"The other orders of the Court appear upon the list certified by the
Chief Justice and filed with the Clerk and will not be announced
orally."
No. 147, Misc. In re Ira H. Latimer, appellant. Appeal from the
Supreme Court of Illinois. Per Curiam: The appeal is dismissed.
Treating the papers whereon the appeal was taken as a petition for
writ of certiorari, certiorari is denied.

Maryland. This case is set for oral argument on Monday, December
9th, next, on the motion for leave to file the bill of complaint and
answer. Two hours is allowed for argument.
No. 30. Floyd Linn Rathbun, petitioner, v. United States of
America. The motion for leave to withdraw the appearance of E. F.
Conly, as counsel for the petitioner is granted.
No. 483. Lawrence Speiser, appellant, v. Justin A. Randall, as
Assessor of Contra Costa County, State of California; and
No. 484. Daniel Prince, appellant, v. City and County of San Fran-
cisco, a Municipal Corporation. Appeals from the Supreme Court
of California. In these cases probable jurisdiction is noted. The
cases are consolidated and transferred to the summary calendar with

took no part in the consideration or decision of these applications.

mains to be determined upon those proceedings. Opinion per curiam
announced by Mr. Chief Justice Warren.
The Chief Justice announced the following orders of the Court:
No. 409. William G. Barr, petitioner, v. Linda A. Matteo and
John J. Madigan. On petition for writ of certiorari to the United
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Per Curiam: The petition for certiorari is granted. The petition
presents this question: "Whether the absolute immunity from defa-
mation suits accorded officials of the Government with respect to acts
done within the scope of their official authority, extends to statements
to the press by high policymaking officers, below cabinet or compara-
ble rank, concerning matters committed by law to their control or
supervision."
In the District Court and the Court of Appeals the litigation was
not so confined. By his motion for a directed verdict and requested
instructions petitioner also presented to the District Court the de-
A
1

fense of qualified privilege. On appeal to the Court of Appeals peti-
tioner, in his brief, raised only the question of absolute immunity,
but on reconsideration he urged the court also to pass on the defense
of qualified privilege. This that court refused to do on the ground
that petitioner, because of the position he had initially taken on the
appeal, had waived the defense. In so holding, the court relied on its
Rule 17 (c) (7), requiring an appellant to set forth in his brief a
statement of the points on which he intends to rely, and Rule 17 (i),
which provides that "Points not presented according to the rules of
the Court, will be disregarded, though the Court, at its option, may
notice and pass upon a plain error not pointed out or relied upon.'
"
The scope of the litigation in the Court of Appeals cannot lessen
this Court's duty to confine itself to the proper exercise of its juris-
diction and the appropriate scope of the judicial review. Thus, an
advisory opinion cannot be extracted from a federal court by agree-
ment of the parties, see Swift & Co. v. Hocking Valley R. Co., 243
U. S. 281, 289, and no matter how much they may favor the settle-
ment of an important question of constitutional law, broad considera-
tions of the appropriate exercise of judicial power prevent such de-
terminations unless actually compelled by the litigation before the
Court. United States v. C. I. O., 335 U. S. 106, 110. Likewise,
"Courts should avoid passing on questions of public law even short
of constitutionality that are not immediately pressing. Many of the
same reasons are present which impel them to abstain from adjudi-
cating constitutional claims against a statute before it effectively and
presently impinges on such claims." Eccles v. Peoples Bank, 333
U. S. 426, 432. Especially in a case involving on the one hand pro-
tection of the reputation of individuals, and on the other the interest
of the public in the fullest freedom of officials to make disclosures
on matters within the scope of their public duties, this Court should
avoid rendering a decision beyond the obvious requirements of the
record. In the present case a ground far narrower than that on
which the Court of Appeals rested its decision, the defense of quali-
fied privilege, was consistently pressed in the District Court and in
fact urged in the Court of Appeals itself. In these circumstances
we think that the broad requirements of judicial power and its proper
exercise should lead to consideration of the defense of qualified
privilege.
To that end, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and
the case remanded to that court with directions to pass upon petition-
er's claim of a qualified privilege.
Mr. Justice Black, with whom the Chief Justice joins, agrees with
the disposition of this case as expressed in the last paragraph.

MONDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1957

Mr. Justice Brennan would grant the petition and consider the
question presented.
Mr. Justice Douglas, dissenting.
The Court of Appeals ruled that the question of the defense of
qualified privilege on which we vacate and remand had been "waived"
by petitioner and therefore should not be considered by the Court of
Appeals under its Rules. That question therefore is not here for us
nor should it be reached by the Court of Appeals. I cannot say that
the Court of Appeals misconstrued its own Rules* or committed
palpable error in refusing to consider the question or unceremoniously
and improperly reached for a constitutional question which it should
have sought to avoid. Under these circumstances it is an unwar-
ranted exercise of our supervisory powers to require that the question
be considered by the Court of Appeals. Instead we should exercise
our discretion by denying certiorari.

Association) from the ports of New York, Philadelphia, and Balti-
more. A tariff differential in favor of Baltimore had existed prior
to this controversy. In a succession of tariff reductions, railroads
serving New York and Philadelphia filed schedules designed to estab-
lish parity of rates among the several ports, while railroads serving
Baltimore filed schedules designed to maintain the differential. Upon
protest against the New York and Philadelphia schedules by Balti-
more civic and commercial interests and railroads serving that port,
the Interstate Commerce Commission instituted an investigation as a
result of which Division 2 of the Commission filed a report approving
the tariff schedules giving Philadelphia parity with Baltimore but
finding all other schedules that had been issued in this series of reduc-
tions to be not just and reasonable. 291 I. C. C. 527. On petition of
various parties, the Commission reopened the proceedings, and on
October 1, 1956, the full Commission modified the findings of the Di-
vision 2 report to the extent of finding the New York schedules, as
well as the Philadelphia schedules, to be just and reasonable, 299
I. C. C. 195. The full Commission's order was challenged in a pro-
ceeding instituted under 28 U. S. C. § 1336, and an appropriate District
Court held that the Commission's approval of parity between New
York and Baltimore was without basis in the record and ordered that
portion of the Commission's order vacated. The court further held
that the Commission's approval of parity between Philadelphia and
Baltimore was not supported by essential findings as to ocean freight
costs and anticipated traffic and remanded that portion of the Com-
mission's order for more explicit findings. The court also granted
other relief subsidiary to these actions. 151 F. Supp. 258. These
are the only portions of the decision below with which we are here
concerned. We put to one side those provisions of the decree below
in which the District Court affirmed other portions of the Commission's
order.
From what appears, it is not precluded that the Commission may
find an interrelationship, within the purview of the National Trans-
portation Policy, supra, among lawful tariffs to be established between
these three ports and the "differential territory." In this light we
deem it appropriate that, in reconsidering the relationship between the
Philadelphia and Baltimore schedules pursuant to the remand of the
District Court, the Commission should be free to reconsider and take
action upon the New York schedules. In carrying out the District
Court's direction regarding the Philadelphia rates, the Commission
should be permitted to take into account the effect of New York rates
on the tariff relationship between Philadelphia and Baltimore and the
effect of that relationship on New York and to enter such orders with
respect to all three ports as the Commission may find to be required

by their interrelationship. Accordingly, on the appeals before us, so
much of the decree of the District Court as did not affirm the order of
the Commission is vacated, and the cause is remanded for appropriate
disposition not inconsistent with this opinion.
The Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Black would affirm the judgment
of the District Court.
The Chief Justice said:
"The other orders of the Court appear upon the list certified by the
Chief Justice and filed with the Clerk and will not be announced.

v. Clairon Vern Gibson. Petition for writ of certiorari to the United

Frankfurter has filed the following memorandum, in which Mr.
Justice Harlan joins:
Although the Court has definitely decided that a denial of a peti-
tion for certiorari carries no legal significance, Brown v. Allen, 344
U. S. 443, 489-497, the bar, in briefs, and lower courts, in their opin-
ions, continue to note such denials by way of reinforcing the authority
of cited lower court decisions. It has therefore seemed to me appro-
priate from time to time to emphasize through concrete illustrations
that a denial of certiorari does not imply approval of the decision for
which review is sought or of its supporting opinion. This case pre-
sents another instance for underlining this nonsignificance of the
denial of certiorari. Not until this Court explicitly holds that in
"F. E. L. A. cases, speculation, conjecture and possibilities suffice to
support a jury verdict," which is the holding of the Court of Appeals in
this case, 246 F. 2d 834, 837, is that to be assumed to be the law of this
Court.

Per Curiam: The judgment of the District Court is reversed and
the case is remanded for consideration by that court of the only claim
that was left open at this Court's prior disposition of this litigation,
to wit, whether "the preferred stock issue as approved by the [Inter-
state Commerce] Commission was in violation of the Interstate Com-
merce Act." Alleghany Corp. v. Breswick & Co., 353 U. S. 151, 175.
Mr. Justice Douglas, with whom The Chief Justice and Mr. Justice
Black concur, dissents.
These cases are a sequel to Alleghany Corporation v. Breswick &
Co., 353 U. S. 151. There, the decision of the District Court was
reversed and the case was remanded for further proceedings. Now,
the decision of the District Court on remand is being summarily
reversed on the ground that the basis of the decision below was
precluded by the mandate and opinion of this Court. For the rea-
sons which follow, it is my opinion that probable jurisdiction should
be noted in these cases.
First. I do not agree that the decision below went beyond the
scope of the opinion and mandate of this Court.
Alleghany Corporation acquired control of the New York Central
Railroad Co., the parent of an integrated system of carriers. Sub-
sequent to the acquisition of control by Alleghany, two of the cor-
porate subsidiaries of the Central system were merged. Alleghany
is basically subject to the control of the Securities and Exchange
Commission under the Investment Company Act of 1940, 54 Stat.
789, 15 U. S. C. § 80a-1 et seq. Section 3 (c) (9) of that Act ex-
empts companies which are subject to regulation by the Interstate
Commerce Commission. The question thus arose as to whether Alle-
ghany, although not a carrier as that term is used in the Interstate
Commerce Act, was subject to regulation by the Interstate Commerce
Commission because of the merger of the subsidiaries of Central of
which Alleghany acquired control and therefore exempt from super-
vision by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The determina-
tion of the Interstate Commerce Commission that Alleghany was
under its jurisdiction was reversed by the District Court but this
Court then reversed the District Court. 353 U. S. 151. The scope
of that holding is the present issue.
In order to attain the status of a carrier the noncarrier must satisfy
the requirements of §5 (2) (a) of the Interstate Commerce Act.
The pertinent portions of that section provide:
"It shall be lawful, with the approval and authorization of the
Commission . . . (i) . . . for a person which is not a carrier to
acquire control of two or more carriers through ownership of
their stock or otherwise; or for a person which is not a carrier and
which has control of one or more carriers to acquire control of

MONDAY, JANUARY 27, 1958
142
another carrier through ownership of its stock or otherwise .."
54 Stat. 899, 905, 49 U. S. C. § 5 (2) (a).
The operation of this section is more easily understood if the two
clauses pertaining to a person not a carrier are numbered as follows:
Clause I. "A person which is not a carrier to acquire control
of two or more carriers through ownership of their stock or
otherwise."
Clause II. "A person which is not a carrier and which has con-
trol of one or more carriers to acquire control of another carrier
through ownership of its stock or otherwise."
It is clear that a person not a carrier must acquire at least two car-
riers before being subject to regulation by the Interstate Commerce
Commission. There may be one transaction acquiring control of two
carriers under Clause I or control may be acquired consecutively
under Clause II. Whichever Clause is applicable to the particular
facts, § 5 (2) (b), requires the Commission to find the proposed acqui-
sition is in the public interest.
The District Court held in its first decision that the Interstate
Commerce Commission did not have jurisdiction under Clause II
because even if Alleghany had control of a carrier, Central, it did
not "acquire control of another carrier" by the device of merging
two of the subsidiaries. That court also held there was no jurisdic-
tion in the Interstate Commerce Commission under Clause I because
the Commission had not approved of the acquisition of control of
Central. 138 F. Supp. 123.
On appeal, this Court reversed. In deciding "the substantive issues
in the litigation" viz ". . . the jurisdiction of the Commission under
§§ 5 (2) and 5 (3) of the Act . . ." the Court held the order grant-
ing Alleghany the status of a carrier was valid. Alleghany Corp. v.
Breswick & Co., supra, at 160–161. The Court based its decision on
Clause II and reasoned that Alleghany controlled Central and had
"acquired" another carrier because of the merger. All of the require-
ments of Clause II of § 5 (2) (a) were satisfied because the Commis-
sion had found the merger to be in the public interest within the
meaning of § 5 (2) (b). Louisville & J. B. & R. Co. Merger, 295
I. C. C. 11, 17.
Because the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission
could be sustained on this ground, the Court found it unnecessary to
decide if acquisition of a system required approval because it was the
acquisition of "two or more carriers" under Clause I.
The Court stated:
"The Commission and Alleghany contend that Commission
approval of the acquisition of a single, integrated system is not
necessary. We need not decide this question, however, and inti-

MONDAY, JANUARY 27, 1958
143
mate no opinion on it. . . ." Alleghany Corp. v. Breswick &
Co., supra, at 161.
The Court then held approval under Clause I was not necessary to
sustain the jurisdiction of the Commission.
Alleghany had not only obtained a status order declaring it to be a
carrier but the Commission had also approved a request by Alleghany
to issue preferred stock. Accordingly, the Court "remanded for con-
sideration by the District Court of appellees' claim, not previously
discussed, that the preferred stock issue as approved by the Commis-
sion was in violation of the Interstate Commerce Act." Id., at 175.
[Italics added.]
On remand, the District Court sustained the stock issue against
various attacks on its basic fairness but enjoined the order approving
the issue on the theory the Commission was required by Clause I of
§5 (2) (a) of the Act to approve Alleghany's acquisition of control
of Central before the stock issue could be approved. 156 F. Supp.
227.
That holding was based on the premise that § 5 (4) of the Act,*
which was not construed in our earlier opinion, made it necessary for
the Commission to consider the legality of the acquisition of control
under Clause I, as well as Clause II, of § 5 (2) (a). For § 5 (4)
makes it "unlawful" without Commission approval for any person
"to enter into any transaction within the scope" of § 5 (2) (a)—
whether Clause I or Clause II. And § 5 (7) authorizes the Com-
mission to investigate and determine whether § 5 (4) has been
violated.
The holding of the District Court on remand did not question the
basis of our earlier holding that the Interstate Commerce Commis-
sion, not the Securities and Exchange Commission, had jurisdiction
of these transactions. It only determined the issue which we held
to be open on remand-whether the transactions were "in violation
of the Interstate Commerce Act." 353 U. S., at 175. That issue
included not only the legality of the preferred stock issue but also the
legality of the acquisition of Central by Alleghany. In other words
the force of § 5 (4) and § 5 (7) makes Clause I of § 5 (2) (a) ap-
plicable as well as Clause II. That at least is the force of the argu-
*Section 5 (4) provides: “It shall be unlawful for any person, except as provided in
paragraph (2), to enter into any transaction within the scope of subparagraph (a)
thereof, or to accomplish or effectuate, or to participate in accomplishing or effectuating,
the control or management in a common interest of any two or more carriers, however
such result is attained, whether directly or indirectly, by use of common directors, officers,
or stockholders, a holding or investment company or companies, a voting trust or trusts,
or in any other manner whatsoever. It shall be unlawful to continue to maintain control
or management accomplished or effectuated after the enactment of this amendatory
paragraph and in violation of its provisions. As used in this paragraph and paragraph
(5), the words 'control or management' shall be construed to include the power to exercise
control or management."

ment under § 5 (4) and § 5 (7), and I for one cannot say it is
frivolous or unsubstantial.
This Court decided the conflicting jurisdictional claims of two
governmental agencies and remanded the case without precluding the
District Court, as I see it, from deciding that approval of the acqui-
sition of a system is required under § 5 before the preferred stock
can be issued. No one, at least no lawyer or judge, should be con-
fused by the fact this Court held approval of the acquisition was not
necessary under the facts of this case for one reason (jurisdiction)
and the District Court held approval was necessary for another reason
(compliance with the Act before the stock could be issued). Respect
for the considered and well-reasoned decision of this three-judge Dis-
trict Court alone should convince us there has been no defiance of our
mandate.
Second. Even if there be doubts as to the force of this reason-
ing, we should hear this case on the merits. The only basis on
which it can be argued that the mandate precluded the decision is
that this Court not only decided the Interstate Commerce Com-
mission had jurisdiction over Alleghany but also that the Commis-
sion properly exercised that jurisdiction in authorizing the issuance
of the stock without approving the acquisition of control of Central.
No such issue was presented to us earlier. The only way it is even
possible to read such a holding from the opinion and mandate is by
implication, since nowhere in the opinion is this particular problem
mentioned. The issue is now forcefully presented by the decision
of a lower court. By reversing summarily on this appeal a substan-
tial question is resolved sub silentio.
The question whether or not the acquisition of a carrier system
is the acquisition of “two or more carriers" within the meaning of
§5 (2) (a) (i) of the Act (Clause I) seems plainly to be a sub-
stantial one. To repeat, the prior opinion of the Court in this case
did not decide this problem. Yet it is arguable that the acquisi-
tion of a system is the acquisition or two or more carriers. Until
this case it apparently has been the consistent view of the Commis-
sion that such an acquisition was the acquisition of two or more
carriers. As Division 4 of the Commission stated:
"We long have recognized under section 5, that railroad sys-
tems are comprised of 2 or more carriers, and that control of
a single system may not lawfully be effectuated without our ap-
proval and authorization. [Citations omitted.] That principle
is considered basic, almost as a definition. So much so, that
the question of acquisition of a carrier system has never been con-
tested before the Commission, and as far as we know, there have
been no court decisions touching on that issue." Louisville &
J. B. & R. Co. Merger, 290 I. C. C. 725, 733.

The full Commission held, however, without citation of any au-
thority, that approval of the acquisition of the control of Central
was not required by § 5 (2) of the Act. 295 I. C. C. 11, 16–17. And
the courts have not resolved that important question.
Moreover, assuming Commission approval is necessary at some time,
must it come before the refinancing can be approved? As shown, if
the transaction is within Clause I, then § 5 (4) makes the acquisition
illegal until Commission approval is obtained. Under those circum-
stances the District Court said:
"The approval of acquisition and continued control is an obvi-
ous first question in any application by Alleghany because unless
the Commission intends to approve this control . . . it would be
granting a wrongdoer sanctuary from the Investment Company
Act; and it would be authorizing and ordering acts in aid of a
known violation of the Interstate Commerce Act. The ultimate
crucial result of such temporizing would be that by granting
seemingly innocuous piecemeal applicatoins, it would unobtru-
sively foreclose itself from any realistic determination of the
fundamental question, because after the passage of time the dis-
ruption of the carriers in the system and of the public service,
caused by divestiture, would be so great that it would necessarily
be discarded as a practical alternative." 156 F. Supp. 227, 236–
237.
Did Congress permit such broken-field running between two stat-
utes, designed to protect the public interest, without a full inquiry
by the Commission into the primary acquisition of control of Cen-
tral by Alleghany? At the very least, there should be a reasoned
decision by this Court approving the rule that makes this possible.
I would note probable jurisdiction in these cases.
No. 639. Roy D. Honeycutt, petitioner, v. Wabash Railway Com-

St. Louis Court of Appeals of Missouri. Per Curiam: The petition
for certiorari is granted and the judgment of the St. Louis Court of
Appeals of the State of Missouri is reversed and the case is remanded
for proceedings in conformity with this opinion. We hold that the
proofs justified with reason the jury's conclusion that employer negli-
gence played a part in producing the petitioner's injury. Ferguson v.

MONDAY, MARCH 3, 1958
165
The Chief Justice announced the following orders of the Court:
No. 13. William H. Black and Ruth F. Black, petitioners, v. A. M.
Amen et al. On writ or certiorari to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.
Per Curiam: Petitioners' amended motion, concurred in by the
attorneys for respondents, is granted. The case is remanded to the
Court of Appeals with directions to remand the cause to the United
States District Court for the District of Kansas to enable the parties to
file their joint motion for the entry of judgment dismissing the action,
as provided in paragraph 3 of the Settlement Agreement dated Febru-
ary 27, 1958, a copy of which is annexed to the amended motion. Mr.
Justice Frankfurter desires to have it added that he assumes that
the legal effect of the Court's order, in which he joins, upon the opinion
and judgment of the Court of Appeals in this case is the conventional
one when a case has become moot here pending our decision on the
merits. United States v. Munsingwear, 340 U. S. 36, 39.
No. 33. Michael Wilson, Gale Sondergard, Howard Da Silva, et al.,
petitioners, v. Loew's Incorporated, a Corporation, Paramount Pic-
tures, Inc., a Corporation, et al. On writ of certiorari to the District
Court of Appeal of California, Second Appellate District.
Per Curiam: The writ is dismissed as improvidently granted be-
cause the judgment rests on an adequate state ground.
Mr. Justice Douglas, dissenting.
By demurrer to petitioners' complaint the respondents in this case
admitted that they agreed with each other to exclude from employ-
ment all persons who refused, on the grounds of the Fifth Amend-
ment, to answer questions concerning their political associations and
beliefs put by the Un-American Activities Committee of the House
of Representatives. The complaint alleged, and the demurrer thereby
conceded, that petitioners had considerable experience in the motion-
picture industry; and that respondents directly or indirectly con-
trolled all motion-picture production and distribution in the United
States and all employment opportunities therein. The California
court sustained the demurrer on the ground that petitioners had not
"alleged that but for defendants' alleged interference any one of
plaintiffs would, or even probably or possibly would, have been em-
ployed in the industry." 142 Cal. App. 2d 183, 195, 298 P. 2d 152, 160.
This ruling on California law should result in a reversal of this
judgment.
This is a case of alleged interference with the pursuit of an occu-
pation, not an alleged interference with a particular contract or busi-
ness relationship. The California cases on interference with the
"right to work" are broad in scope. In James v. Marinship Corp., 25

MONDAY, MARCH 3, 1958
166
Cal. 2d 721, 155 P. 2d 329, the California Supreme Court held that a
union could not exclude Negroes from membership in the union when
at the same time there was a closed shop in the industry. The Marin-
ship case was later followed in Williams v. International Brother-
hood, 27 Cal. 2d 586, 165 P. 2d 903, where some of the plaintiffs were
former employees. No showing of the possibility of employment
was made. In Williams the court emphasized that a "closed shop
agreement with a single employer is in itself a form of monopoly";
and it condemned attempts by a union "to control by arbitrary selec-
tion the fundamental right to work." 27 Cal. 2d, at 591; 165 P. 2d,
at 906. Here on the pleadings the respondents comprise a nationwide
monopoly over the industry and arbitrarily place petitioners on a
"black list."
Dotson v. International Alliance, 34 Cal. 2d 362, 210 P. 2d 5, held
that out-of-state workers, qualified for union membership, could
recover damages "for wrongful interference with their right to work”
against the union which denied membership. 34 Cal. 2d, at 374;
210 P. 2d, at 12. No showing of a likelihood of employment was
made in that monopoly situation.
Surely then, the failure of these petitioners to allege a particular
job opportunity does not mean they did not state a cause of action
within the meaning of those California cases. Their pleadings seem
to bring them squarely within those decisions. The fact that damages
may be uncertain is no barrier to enforcement of the right to work.
See Harris v. National Union of Cooks and Stewards, 98 Cal. App.
2d 733, 738, 221 P. 2d 136, 139.
I, therefore, conclude that the lower court, in not mentioning these
cases nor differentiating them, and drawing almost entirely on de-
cisions from other jurisdictions, has fashioned a different rule for
this case. I can see no difference where the "right to work" is denied
because of race and where, as here, because the citizen has exercised.
Fifth Amendment rights. To draw such a line is to discriminate
against the assertion of a particular federal constitutional right.
That a State may not do consistently with the Equal Protection Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment. Williams v. Georgia, 349 U. S. 375.
The Chief Justice said:
"The other orders of the Court appear upon the list certified by the
Chief Justice and filed with the Clerk and will not be announced
orally."

Mr. Justice Harlan concurs in the result for the reasons given in
his Memorandum in Gibson v. Thompson, 355 U. S. 18. For the rea-
sons set forth in his opinion in Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352
U. S. 500, 524, Mr. Justice Frankfurter is of the view that the writ
of certiorari is improvidently granted. Mr. Justice Whittaker
dissents.
No. 225, Misc. David R. Hurley, petitioner, v. Joseph E. Ragen,
Warden. On petition for writ of certiorari to the Circuit Court of
Will County, Illinois. Per Curiam: The petition for writ of certiorari
is denied without consideration of the questions raised therein and
without prejudice to the institution by petitioner of proceedings in
any Illinois state court of competent jurisdiction under the Illinois
Post-Conviction Hearing Act of August 4, 1949. Ill. Rev. Stat. 1957,
ch. 38, § 826.
No. - Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad Co.,
appellant, v. State of Illinois et al. The application for supersedeas
presented to Mr. Justice Clark and by him referred to the Court
is denied.
Mr. Justice Frankfurter, whom Mr. Justice Burton, Mr. Justice
Harlan, and Mr. Justice Whittaker join, dissenting:
"The public interest, justice between the litigants, and the protec-
tion of our own appellate jurisdiction seem to me to require that peti-
tioner's application for a supersedeas in this case be granted. The
dispute underlying the application involves intrastate commuter fares
on petitioner's Chicago suburban service. The Interstate Commerce
Commission, in proceedings under § 13 (4) of the Interstate Commerce
Act, 24 Stat. 383, as amended, 41 Stat. 484, 49 U. S. C. § 13 (4), found
that existing intrastate fares caused undue discrimination against
interstate commerce, and in order to remove such discrimination pre-
scribed fares higher than those authorized by the state commission.
The District Court set aside the order, enjoined its enforcement, and
remanded the case to the Commission. 146 F. Supp. 195. On appeal
to this Court, we found that the Commissioner's order lacked "findings
which reflect the commuter service deficit in the totality of intra-
state revenues..." Chicago, M., St. P. & P. R. Co. v. Illinois, 355 U. S.
300, 308. The District Court's judgment was modified to provide
for a remand to the Commission for proceedings not inconsistent with
the opinion of this Court.
It was noted in the opinion that the injunction of the District Court
had been "stayed pending the hearing of the appeal to this Court. The
excess fares are being impounded under a provision of the stay order
providing for their refund to the persons who paid them in the event
the judgment appealed from is affirmed." 355 U. S., at 302, n. 2. In the

MONDAY, MARCH 17, 1958
200
District Court petitioner moved for a stay of that court's original
decree requiring refund of the excess fares, pending the further pro-
ceedings before the Commission contemplated by the judgment of this
Court. On February 28, 1958, the motion was denied, and petitioner
was ordered to begin distributing the impounded fund immediately.
A notice of appeal from this order was filed on March 3, 1958, and the
District Court denied a stay of its order pending a determination of
the appeal.
It can hardly be denied that the contention raised by petitioner's
appeal from the order of February 28 is substantial: that if after
further proceedings before the Commission a valid order is entered
to the same effect as the order earlier set aside, petitioner will be en-
titled to the impounded funds. Reliance on Atlantic Coast Line R. Co.
v. Florida, 295 U. S. 301, gives force to the argument that such is
present law. In that case the order of the Commission raising the
intrastate rates was set aside "solely upon the ground that the facts
supporting the conclusion were not embodied in the findings." 295
U. S., at 311. After the want of proper findings had been remedied
and a new order sustained on appeal, the carrier was allowed to re-
tain the monies collected under the first order of the Commission. The
final result of the litigation, as the Court summed it up in United
States v. Morgan, 307 U. S. 183, 195, was that the railroads were per-
mitted to collect and retain the higher rates for a period during which
there was no lawful order of the Commission superseding the state
commission rates.
If it is conceded, as it must be, that it is not frivolous to suppose that
the petitioner may ultimately be entitled to the impounded fund, can
it be doubted that the District Court, or this Court if the District Court
has failed to act, is bound, in the absence of serious injury to the inter-
ests of others, to exercise equitable control over the fund to the end that
petitioner's claim, if it is rightful, will not be rendered nugatory be-
fore it can be enforced? Such control has been exercised before by this
Court. In United States v. Morgan, supra, a case presenting consider-
ations very similar to those raised by petitioner's appeal, the Court
stayed and superseded a District Court order requiring distribution
of a fund after this Court had set aside an order of the Secretary of
Agriculture and before further poceedings could be had before him.
Our first judgment in this case could no doubt have provided for
protection of the fund pending the eventual outcome of the proceed-
ings before the Commission. The broad power on review of the judg-
ments of lower courts to remand the cause and direct the entry of
such appropriate judgment, decree, or order, or require such further
proceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances, 28
U. S. C. § 2106, would have encompassed such a result. See also
Addison v. Holly Hill Fruit Products, Inc., 322 U. S. 607, 619–623.
1

MONDAY, MARCH 17, 1958

And the exercise of this equitable power is no less appropriate at the
present stage of the proceedings when it has become necessary for
the protection of petitioner's rights on appeal.
The fact that petitioner agreed to the order providing that the
fund would be distributed if the District Court's judgment was af-
firmed is no barrier to the just disposition of the application now be-
fore us. In the first place, it is not at all clear that by their agree-
ment the parties contemplated distribution of the fund in the circum-
stances that in fact came to pass. Although as a verbal matter it is
arguable that the judgment of the District Court was "affirmed,” our
judgment was based on grounds substantially different from those of
the District Court. The judgment of this Court by no means finally
determined the legality of the intrastate fares. It looked to further
proceedings before the Commission that may well result in a valid
order finding the fares discriminatory. Moreover, petitioner could
not, by its agreement, bargain away the rights of the public, or re-
lieve the court from its obligation to frame a decree that would im-
plement the policy of the Federal Act protecting the revenues of in-
terstate carriers. No more can such an agreement relieve this Court
of its duty to do substantial justice, insofar as that is within the power
of a court, between the contending interests in the litigation.
When the fund in this case is distributed, as a result of the inaction
of this Court, that fund is irrecoverable, and whatever public inter-
est may ultimately be shown in the retention of the fund by the carrier
as a public agency is conclusively defeated, quite apart from its merits.
The fact that if the fund is not immediately distributed some of the
commuters may through carelessness lose their coupons or through
indifference fail to claim refunds even if ultimately they should be
allowed is scarcely a comparable equity in favor of distributing the
whole fund at once. If the commuters have retained their coupons
this long, it is unlikely that they will throw them away during the
few additional months necessary for a just disposition of the fund.
And no great delay need necessarily be involved. The Commission
has assured the parties that further proceedings on the remand will
be promptly had, and petitioner has informed the Court that hearings
will be held on or about March 24. We can easily condition the stay
on effective measures for expedition. Moreover, disposition of peti-
tioner's appeal from the order of February 28 need not await the ulti-
mate outcome of the Commission hearings. If after a consideration
of the appeal the Court should conclude that a second order by the
Commission could in no event give petitioner a right to the impounded
fund, then of course it would be promptly distributed. But if, after
a careful consideration of the questions raised by the appeal, we con-
cluded that a second, valid order by the Commission would entitle
petitioner to the fund, justice would require "the court to await the
12

MONDAY, MARCH 17, 1958
202
outcome of the proceedings in order that it may discharge the duty
which it owes to the litigants and the public by avoiding unlawful
disposition of the fund in the meantime, and ultimately distributing it
to those found to be entitled to it." United States v. Morgan, supra,
307 U. S. 183, 198. I think that the Court, by refusing to grant a
supersedeas, rejects a commonsense and equitable disposition of the
case."

reversed and the cause is remanded for trial. We hold that the peti-
tioner's evidence presented an evidentiary basis for jury findings (1)
whether or not the tug G. W. Whiteman was in navigation, Senko
v. LaCrosse Dredging Corp., 352 U. S. 370, 373; Carumbo v. Cape
Cod S.S. Co., 123 F. 2d 991; (2) whether or not the petitioner's dece-
dent was a seaman and member of the crew of the tug within the
meaning of the Jones Act, 41 Stat. 1007, 46 U. S. C. § 688; Senko v.
LaCrosse Dredging Corp., supra; Gianfala v. Texas Co., 350 U. S. 879 ;
South Chicago Co. v. Bassett, 309 U. S. 251; Grimes v. Raymond
Concrete Pile Co., U. S. ; and (3) whether or not employer
negligence played a part in producing decedent's death. Ferguson v.
Moore-McCormack Lines, 352 U. S. 521; Rogers v. Missouri Pacific
R. Co., 352 U. S. 500; Schulz v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 350 U. S. 523.
-
For reasons set forth in his opinion in Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R.
Co., 352 U. S. 500, 524, Mr. Justice Frankfurter is of the view that
the writ of certiorari is improvidently granted.
Mr. Justice Harlan, with whom Mr. Justice Whittaker joins, dis-
senting.
I think the evidence is insufficient to raise a question for the jury as
to whether petitioner's decedent at the time of the accident was a sea-
man within the purview of the Jones Act.
Respondent was the owner of a wharf, barge and tug, all situated
on the Mississippi River. The barge was moored to the wharf, and
the tug was lashed to the barge. On October 7, 1953, the decedent
met death by drowning in unclear circumstances. He was last seen
alive running across the barge to the tug, and it was petitioner's theory
of the case that the decedent had fallen into the river between the
barge and the tug, and that respondent was liable under the Jones
Act because of his negligent failure to provide a gangplank for cross-
ing between the two vessels.
For some months before the accident the tug had been withdrawn
from navigation because it was inoperable. During the entire year
of 1953 the tug had neither captain nor crew and reported no earn-
ings; the only evidence of its movement during the year related to an
occasion on which it was towed to dry dock. At the time of the acci-
dent the tug was undergoing rehabilitation preparatory to a Coast
Guard inspection, presumably in anticipation of a return to service.
During the period of the tug's inactivity, the decedent was employed
as a laborer doing odd jobs around respondent's wharf, and on the
morning of the accident he had been engaged in cleaning the boiler
of the tug.
In my opinion it taxes imagination to the breaking point to consider
this unfortunate individual to have been a seaman at the time of the
accident within the meaning of the Jones Act, and I think that if a
jury were so to find, its verdict would have to be set aside. Desper

v. Starved Rock Ferry Co., 342 U. S. 187. Because I would affirm
the judgment of the Court of Appeals on this ground, I do not reach
the question whether the accident was attributable in any way to
respondent's negligence.

The facts are undisputed. Petitioners brought this action to re-
cover the purchase price of securities alleged to have been worthless
and fraudulently sold to them by respondents in violation of § 12 of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (48 Stat. 84; 15 U. S. C. A.
§ 771) and of § 78 J (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (48 Stat. 891; 15 U. S. C. A. § 78 J (b). Respondents moved
to dismiss petitioners' first amended complaint for failure to state a
claim upon which relief could be granted. On May 10, 1955, the
District Court sustained the motion, dismissed the complaint, and
granted petitioners "twenty days from this date to file an amended
complaint." On May 27, 1955, petitioners moved to vacate the order
of May 10 dismissing the first amended complaint or, in the alterna-
tive, to extend the time to file an amended complaint. On that date
(May 27, 1955) the Court overruled petitioners' motion to vacate the
order of May 10, but granted leave to petitioners to file an amended
complaint within 20 days from May 27, 1955. Petitioners did not
file an amended complaint. On March 25, 1957, petitioners filed an
instrument in the case by which they elected to stand on their first
amended complaint. On that day (March 25, 1957) the Court or-
dered that "this cause of action be and it is hereby dismissed without
costs." On April 16, 1957, petitioners filed notice of appeal “from
final judgment entered in this action on March 25, 1957." Respond-
ent moved in the Court of Appeals to dismiss the appeal as untimely.
The Court of Appeals, holding that the order of May 27, 1955, be-
came the District Court's final judgment in the case when petitioners
failed to file an amended complaint within the 20 days thereby al-
lowed for that purpose, sustained the motion and dismissed the appeal
of April 16, 1957, as not taken within 30 days from the entry of the
judgment. 246 F. 2d 281.
We think that the District Court's order of May 27, 1955, denying
petitioners' motion to vacate the order of May 10, 1955, but granting
further leave to petitioners to amend their complaint, did not consti-
tute the final judgment in the case. It did not direct "that all relief
be denied" (Rule 58 of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure) but left the
suit pending for further proceedings "either by amendment of the
[complaint] or entry of a final judgment." Missouri & Kansas Inter-
urban R. Co. v. City of Olathe, 222 U. S. 185. The situation did "not
differ from an order sustaining a demurrer with leave to amend; an-
other order of absolute dismissal after expiration of the time allowed
for amendment is required to make a final disposition of the cause."

Although to be sure nearly two years elapsed between the time
petitioners were given leave to file an amended complaint and their
motion of March 25, 1957, the defendants also did not, as they so easily
could have done, nor did the District Court exercising power sua
sponte over its own calendar, take any step to put a definitive end to
the case and thereby fix an unequivocal terminal date for appealabil-
ity. The undesirability of useless delays in litigation is more than
offset by the hazards of confusion or misunderstanding as to the time
for appeal.
It was the District Court's order of March 25, 1957, dismissing “this
cause of action," that constituted the final judgment in the case. It
directed "that all relief be denied" and required "the clerk [to] enter
judgment" accordingly (Rule 58). The appeal of April 16, 1957, was
taken within 30 days from the date of entry of the judgment and
hence was timely under 73 (a) of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
The writ of certiorari is granted and the judgment of the Court of
Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded to that court for further
proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

peals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Per Curiam: The peti-
tion for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit is granted. Charged in a three-
count indictment for violation of R. S. § 102, as amended, 2 U. S. C.
§ 192, for failure to answer three questions put to him by a subcommit-
tee of the Internal Security Subcommittee of the Senate Committee
on the Judiciary, the petitioner, having waived trial by jury, was
found guilty on all counts and sentenced to six months' imprisonment
and to pay a fine of $1,000. After the sentence was sustained by the
Court of Appeals, 240 F. 2d 46, this Court, having granted a petition
for certiorari, remanded the case, 354 U. S. 930, to the Court of Ap-
peals for reconsideration in light of Watkins v. United States, 354
U. S. 178. On reargument before the Court of Appeals sitting en
banc, a divided court again affirmed the conviction. 252 F. 2d 828.
The broad scope of authority vested in Congress to conduct investi-
gations as an incident to the "legislative Powers" granted by the Con-
stitution is not questioned. See Watkins v. United States, supra, at
215. But when Congress seeks to enforce its investigating authority
through the criminal process administered by the federal judiciary,
the safeguards of criminal justice become operative. The subject mat-
ter of inquiry before the subcommittee at which petitioner appeared
as a witness concerned the recantation of prior testimony by a witness
named Matusow. In the course of the hearing, the questioning of
petitioner entered upon "a brief excursion," 240 F. 2d 46, 53, into
proposed legislation barring Communists from practice at the federal
bar, a subject not within the subcommittee's scope of inquiry as author-
ized by its parent committee. Inasmuch as petitioner's refusal to
answer related to questions not clearly pertinent to the subject on
which the two-member subcommittee conducting the hearing had been
authorized to take testimony, the conditions necessary to sustain a
conviction for deliberately refusing to answer questions pertinent to
the authorized subject matter of a congressional hearing are wanting.
Watkins v. United States, supra. The judgment of the Court of Ap-
peals is therefore reversed and the cause remanded to the District
Court with directions to dismiss the indictment.
Mr. Justice Burton took no part in the consideration or decision
of this case.
Mr. Justice Harlan, concurring.
In joining the Court's opinion, I am constrained to write these few
words with reference to my Brother Clark's suggestion that the Court
should hear argument in this case. As the limited scope of the Sub-
committee's authority is not in dispute, the controlling issue is whether
the pertinency of the questions put to petitioner was of such "un-
disputable clarity" as to justify his punishment in a court of law for
1

MONDAY, MAY 19, 1958
276
refusing to answer them. Watkins v. United States, 354 U. S. 178, 214.
That issue can only be determined by scrutiny of the record, and a
full-dress argument could hardly shed further light on the matter.
In such circumstances prompt disposition of the case before us cer-
tainly constitutes sound judicial administration. For my part, it is
abundantly evident that the pertinency of none of the three questions
involved can be regarded as undisputably clear, as indeed is evidenced
by the different interpretations of the record advanced by the mem-
bers of this Court and of the Court of Appeals who have considered
this issue.
Mr. Justice Clark, with whom Mr. Justice Whittaker concurs, dis-
senting.
Petitioner concedes that the subject matter under inquiry, the
Matusow recantation, "was clearly defined by the subcommittee and
[he] was specifically notified as to what that subject was at the time
he was subpoenaed."* If any of the three questions which petitioner
refused to answer is clearly pertinent to that subject, the judgment
must be sustained, since a general sentence was imposed after con-
viction on three counts, one for each refusal. Claassen v. United
States, 142 U. S. 140 (1891).
The third question, covered by the third count of the indictment,
was whether petitioner was or ever had been "a member of the Law-
yers' Section of the Communist Party, U. S. A." I think it obvious
that the "brief excursion" into proposed legislation barring Com-
munist lawyers from the federal courts did not carry as far as this
question, which was vital to a matter in which the Committee prop-
erly was interested-petitioner's role in a Communist conspiracy to
procure Matusow's recantation. The context of the question clearly
relates it to the recantation rather that the proposed legislation. Just
prior to asking about membership in the Lawyers' Section of the
Party, the Committee asked three times whether petitioner had at-
tended a birthday party for one Alexander Bittelman. Petitioner
replied that he did not remember. The Committee already had re-
ports that he was at the party, which numbered 50 high Communists
among its guests, and that information was one of the reasons why
he was called before the Committee. He then was asked if he had
"any connection with the legal commission or law commission of the
Communist Party," for the Committee also had information that
either he or one Nathan Witt probably was the head of a group of
important Communists constituting a lawyers' commission to formu-
late legal strategy for the party. Upon answering that he "[did]
*The concession appears in petitioner's application for certiorari last year, No. 884,
1956 Term, which we granted in connection with our remand in light of Watkins v.
United States, 354 U. S. 178 (1957). Nothing in the present application for certiorari
controverts the concession.

not know of any such organization," he was asked the question at
issue, namely, whether he was or had been a member of the Lawyers'
Section of the Party. Its relationship to the Matusow recantation is
confirmed by the Committee's next question, asking whether peti-
tioner had attended a Communist meeting in 1947 "at the home of
Angus Cameron," publisher of Matusow's autobiography.
When the question is viewed in context, it seems to me that per-
tinency is clearly established. Petitioner is a seasoned lawyer with
trial experience. Both questions and answers may go afield in the
examination of a witness-a truism to every trial practitioner-but
that fact cannot license a witness' refusal to answer questions which
are relevant.
In any event the Government should be given a chance to present
oral argument on the pertinency of the question under the third count
before petitioner is freed. Opportunity for a hearing is particu-
larly important here because the issue is one that confronts the Com-
mittees of the Congress day after day. For these reasons I dissent
from the summary reversal of petitioner's conviction.

No. 881. William Amlin and Darrell Amlin, d/b/a Amlin Cartage,
H. Bondy, d/b/a Bondy Cartage, et al., appellants, v. Peter Verbeem,
Doing Business as Peters Cartage, et al. Appeal from the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. Per
Curiam: The motion to affirm is granted and the judgment is affirmed.
No. 293, Misc. Edward J. Ellis, petitioner, v. United States of
America. On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Per Curiam: The petition for writ of certiorari is granted, as is
leave to proceed in forma pauperis.
The Court of Appeals denied petitioner leave to appeal in forma
pauperis a conviction for housebreaking and larceny. 249 F. 2d 478.
The Solicitor General concedes that leave to appeal should have been
allowed unless petitioner's contentions on the merits were frivolous.
The only statutory requirement for the allowance of an indigent's
appeal is the applicant's "good faith." 28 U. S. C. § 1915. In the
absence of some evident improper motive, the applicant's good faith is
established by the presentation of any issue that is not plainly frivo-
lous. Farley v. United States, 354 U. S. 521. The good-faith test
must not be converted into a requirement of a preliminary showing
of any particular degree of merit. Unless the issues raised are so
frivolous that the appeal would be dismissed in the case of a nonin-
digent litigant, Fed. Rules Crim Proc. 39 (a), the request of an in-
digent for leave to appeal in forma pauperis must be allowed.
Normally, allowance of an appeal should not be denied until an
indigent has had adequate representation by counsel. Johnson v.
United States, 352 U. S. 565. In this case, it appears that the two
attorneys appointed by the Court of Appeals, performed essentially
the role of amici curiae. But representation in the role of an advo-
cate is required. If counsel is convinced, after conscientious investi-
gation, that the appeal is frivolous, of course, he may ask to withdraw
剁

on that account. If the court is satisfied that counsel has diligently
investigated the possible grounds of appeal, and agrees with counsel's
evaluation of the case, then leave to withdraw may be allowed and
leave to appeal may be denied. In this case, the Solicitor General
concedes, and after examining the record we agree, that the issue
presented-probable cause to arrest-is not one that "can necessarily
be characterized as frivolous." Accordingly, the judgment of the
Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for recon-
sideration in light of this opinion.
No. 778. Williard Uphaus, appellant, v. Louis C. Wyman, Attorney
General, State of New Hampshire. The motion for leave to use the

Mr. Justice Frankfurter has filed the following dissent:
"The petitions for rehearing in these cases should be granted. Peti-
tioners direct attention to the statement in the Court's opinion of

MONDAY, JUNE 9, 1958
312
March 3, 355 U. S. 489, 492 (Prelim. Print), that "There is no con-
tention that these taxes were levied directly against the United States
or its property.' The contentions made by the parties throughout this
litigation and the characteristics of the taxes sustained make evident
that the case was decided under a misapprehension of what was in
issue. Simply to delete from the quoted sentence reference to what
the parties contended, as has now been done, cannot delete the sig-
nificance of its original inclusion in the opinion as a manifestation
of the direction of the Court's thoughts. In reaching the conclusion
that the tax here involved is indistinguishable from a tax on the privi-
lege of possessing or using government property, the Court proceeded
on mistaken notions about Michigan tax law and its administration.
"The petitions for rehearing make more vivid than did the original
briefs the distinction between the ad valorem property tax that was
in fact imposed and a privilege tax with which the former was identi-
fied. The distinction is deeply embedded in Michigan statutory and
constitutional law, and guides taxing authorities in their administra-
tion of the local statutes. The tax that Michigan levied and this
Court sustained is imposed on the property of the United States.
Property is the subject of the tax and is the ultimate reliance for its
satisfaction. The State has a lien on the property to assure collec-
tion. The person in possession on tax day is liable for the tax; but
since he has a right of recovery against the owner secured by a lien,
he is in effect simply a collector of the tax. It is persuasively shown
that, had the state authorities been satisfied that full ownership in
the particular property was in the United States-an issue for con-
trolling determination by this Court-the tax would not have been
imposed. Indeed, as to tools concededly owned by the United States,
no attempt was made to collect a tax. Such administrative practice
by the taxing authorities would be inexplicable if the tax were con-
ceived as an excise, a privilege tax, that is, on possession of property.
"The petitions for rehearing have thrown into sharp relief the fact
that the tax here imposed is simply an ordinary ad valorem tax
imposed on the property, a tax indistinguishable from that in United
States v. County of Allegheny, 322 U. S. 174. Therefore this tax is
sustainable, unless Michigan law is to be construed in a way wholly
at variance with the actual provisions of the state statutes and demon-
strated administrative practice thereunder, only by disregarding
Allegheny or overruling it. The Court does not purport to overrule
Allegheny. The erroneous hypothesis about Michigan law underlying
the Court's opinion could hardly have failed to obscure the full impli-
cations of the decision the Court was called upon to make. Due regard
for the importance of these cases-as a matter of federal finance, of
course, but even more so from the point of view of federal-state rela-
1

tions and the demands of sound adjudication call for reargument.
The Court would then be able to consider the power of a State to levy
a tax undisputably imposed upon property owned by the United States.
Because I deem a reargument to be required, I do not mean to imply
that it would lead to a different result. The basis of an adjudication
may be as important as the decision. The Court has rightly been
parsimonious in ordering rehearings, but the occasions on which
important and difficult cases have been reargued have, I believe,
enhanced the deliberative process."

affirmed and cases remanded to the Courts of Appeals. Opinion per
curiam announced by Mr. Chief Justice Warren.
The Chief Justice announced the following order of the Court:
No. 1095. John Aaron et al., petitioners, v. William G. Cooper
et al., Members of the Board of Directors of the Little Rock, Ar-
kansas, Independent School District, and Virgil T. Blossom, Super-
intendent of Schools. On petition for writ of certiorari to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Per Curiam: On
June 21, 1958, the District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas
entered an order authorizing the members of the School Board of
Little Rock, Arkansas, and the Superintendent of School, to suspend
until January 1961 a plan of integration theretofore approved by
that court in August 1956, Aaron v. Cooper, 143 F. Supp. 855, and
affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in April 1957.
243 F. 2d 361. On June 23, 1958, the District Court denied an ap-
plication for a stay of execution of its order. An appeal was docketed
in the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit on June 24, 1958,
and there is pending in that court an application for a stay of the
District Court's order.
By the present petition this Court is asked to bring the case here
before the Court of Appeals has had an opportunity to act upon
the
petition for a stay or to hear the appeal. The power of the Court
to do so has been exercised but rarely, and the issues and circum-
stances relevant to the present petition do not warrant its exercise
now. The order that the District Court suspended has, in different
postures, been before the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit
three times already. Aaron v. Cooper, 243 F. 2d 361; Thomason v.
Cooper, — F. 2d - (April 28, 1958); Faubus v. United States, — F.
2d (April 28, 1958). That court is the regular court for review-
ing orders of the District Court here concerned, and the appeal and
the petition for a stay are matters properly to be adjudicated by it in
the first instance.
-
-
We have no doubt that the Court of Appeals will recognize the vital
importance of the time element in this litigation, and that it will act
upon the application for a stay or the appeal in ample time to permit
arrangements to be made for the next school year.
Accordingly, the petition for certiorari is denied.
The Chief Justice said:
"The other orders of the Court appear upon the list certified by
the Chief Justice and filed with the Clerk and will not be announced
orally."
