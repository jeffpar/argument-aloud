SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Present: Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice White, Justice Marshall,
Justice Blackmun, Justice Stevens, Justice O'Connor, Justice Scalia,
and Justice Kennedy.
The Chief Justice said:
"I have the honor to announce, on behalf of the Court, that the Octo-
ber 1989 Term of the Supreme Court of the United States is now closed
and that the October 1990 Term is now convened. Today's orders of the
Court have been certified by the Chief Justice, filed with the Clerk, and
will not be announced orally."

The Chief Justice said:
"Before calling the first case for argument this morning, it is appro-
priate for us to note that today, for the first time in thirty-four years,
a Term of the Court commences without our colleague Justice William
J. Brennan sitting beside us on the bench. For the past fifteen years,
since the retirement of Justice William O. Douglas, Justice Brennan
was the senior Associate Justice of the Court. Following his retirement.
this summer, his colleagues on the Court joined in sending him a letter
which reads as follows:
Dear Bill:
Your decision to retire has already brought forth from others numerous acco-
lades rightly testifying to your accomplishments as a Justice of this Court. You
served here for nearly thirty-four years-a period exceeded by only four other
members of the Court. But your profound influence upon American constitu-

2
MONDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1990
tional law arises not merely from the length of your service, but from the many
notable opinions which you authored during that time.
We, who have been your colleagues, have had the benefit of knowing you in a
way that scholars viewing your place in history cannot. You have been our com-
panion in our daily sojourns on the bench and in our sessions around the conference
table. The personal warmth which you radiate has enriched all of our lives, and
has inspired all of us to maintain the cordial relations so necessary among those
who may find themselves in disagreement with one another in the work which they
mutually undertake.
We will miss your wise counsel in our deliberations, but we know that present
surcease from the labors of the Court bids fair to restore you to the good health
which we so very much wish for you,
Affectionately,
William H. Rehnquist
Byron R. White
Thurgood Marshall
Harry A. Blackmun
John P. Stevens
Sandra Day O'Connor
Antonin Scalia
Anthony M. Kennedy."
Justice Brennan replied as follows:
"Dear Colleagues,
I am deeply touched by your letter regarding my retirement. Its gracious senti-
ments reflect the very collegiality to which you pay tribute, and it is therefore a
fitting keepsake-one that I and my family will always cherish-of our work to-
gether. The opportunity to have served on this Court has, of course, been a rare
privilege, but equally rare has been the chance to form so many rich friendships in
the course of that work.
I had hoped that this happy identity between colleagues and friends would per-
sist for many more years. Indeed, my reluctance to retire from the Court was
sharpened by an awareness that I will no longer sit with each of you on the bench
or in the conferences, sharing in the work of this mutual enterprise. I believe the
Court has achieved much in recent decades, and the pleasure of reflecting on that
record is strengthened by the knowledge that we have participated in these accom-
plishments together. But I know that friendships forged in this Court are sus-
tained by more than a common endeavor, and I therefore take comfort in the
expectation that our personal ties will endure in the years ahead. With warm best
wishes to each of you,
Sincerely.
William J. Brennan, Jr."

The Chief Justice said:
"The Court is in special session this afternoon to receive the Resolu-
tions of the Bar of the Supreme Court in tribute to our former colleague
and friend, the late Justice Arthur J. Goldberg.

MONDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1990
163
"The Solicitor General is recognized at this time for the purpose of
presenting those resolutions which were adopted by the Bar. Mr. Solici-
tor General."
Mr. Solicitor General Starr addressed the Court as follows:
"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: At a meeting of the
members of the Bar of the Supreme Court this afternoon, a Resolution
memorializing our regard for the Honorable Arthur J. Goldberg and ex-
pressing our profound sorrow at his death was unanimously adopted.
With the Court's leave, I shall proceed to read this Resolution to the
Court.
RESOLUTION
"The members of the Bar of the Supreme Court of the United States
meet today to record our respect, admiration, and affection for Arthur
J. Goldberg, who served as Associate Justice from 1962 to 1965, and
who gave life for sixty years to the ideal of justice as it is embodied
in law.
"Few people find the variety of opportunities for public service that
come to Arthur Goldberg. Still fewer improve their opportunities so
fully.
-
"Yet if this extraordinary man played an unusual number of different
roles as practitioner, as military intelligence officer, as Cabinet mem-
ber, as an Associate Justice on this Court, as Ambassador, as states-
man emeritus-he always kept his own character. He possessed both an
unfailing sense of justice and the ability to make it work.
"Born in Chicago on August 8, 1908, Arthur Goldberg would say
sixty years later, 'my concern for justice, for peace, for enlightenment,
for morality all stem from my heritage.' He was speaking particularly
on that occasion, when he accepted the presidency of the American
Jewish Committee, as a proud heir of Judaism. Many of us, of all faiths,
were introduced to that inheritance as guests at Passover Seders at the
Goldberg home on Albemarle Street. He wrote the family Haggadah,
equating the Israelites' story to the civil rights struggle of the 1960s,
and he told the Story of Exodus in contemporary terms.
"Justice Goldberg was also acknowledging, with equal pride, the leg-
acy of deep understanding and compassion that came from the humble
circumstances of his formative years. True to the great universals of his
Faith, he was also American to the core. His father, Joseph Goldberg,
the town clerk of Zhinkov, a Ukrainian village northeast of Kiev, had
come to Texas in 1890 by way of Vladivostok, Alaska, and California,
and had then, in the pioneer tradition of this country-but reversing

164
MONDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1990
the conventional route-driven a horse and wagon across the great
plains to Chicago.
"Sending as soon as he could for his wife Rebecca and their daughter
Mary, Joseph carved out a living the hard way. An educated man, he
could find work only as a peddler to shops and hotels on Chicago's West
Side of fruits and vegetables he picked up at the South Water Street
Market. The family grew rapidly, Arthur being the last of Rebecca and
Joseph's six children born in this country.
"Arthur would recall that the family moved from apartment to apart-
ment each year, taking advantage of the one month's free rent to new
tenants. Another recollection was of going out on the street with his
father in the early morning before school opened to sell vegetables from
a wagon pulled by a horse that had only one good eye. They couldn't
afford, he explained, a horse with two good eyes.
"After his father's death, when Arthur was eight, his brothers and
sisters, none of whom had gone beyond grade school, pitched in to send
him to Theodore Herzl Elementary School. He went on to Crane Junior
College where he had an English teacher, Lillian Herstein, who was
an official of the Chicago Federation of Labor and who interested her
young pupil in the needs of working people. Arthur took some classes,
too, at De Paul University.
"In 1926, the eighteen-year-old Goldberg, deeply affected by Clar-
ence Darrow's defense of Loeb and Leopold, entered Northwestern
Law School. John Henry Wigmore, Northwestern's dean, picked him
out to help on the preparation of the Third Edition of Wigmore's Cases
on the Law of Evidence. Earning his keep all the way, Arthur finished
at the top of his class and began clerking in one of the Chicago firms.
"Two years later, the fledgling lawyer married Dorothy Kurgans.
They shared brilliance of mind, warmth of heart, and commitment to
justice and humanity. Dorothy, the adored mother of Barbara and Rob-
ert, became a treasured artist and admired author, a distinguished civic
leader, and the beloved friend of all those in the Goldbergs' ever-widen-
ing circle of acquaintances and associates. For 57 years, until her death
in 1988, she and Arthur drew much of their strength from each other.
"Joining at first an established and distinguished Chicago law firm,
the brilliant young Northwestern graduate soon realized his lack of en-
thusiasm for representing bondholder committees and foreclosing mort-
gages on little people's property. Undaunted by the darkest economic
clouds the country has ever known, he and an associate set up their own
office in 1933, and sought their clientele among employees and labor
unions.

MONDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1990

"This courageous step was the start of almost thirty years of labor
representation. It would lead to Arthur Goldberg's national preemi-
nence in the field, and to his becoming the only labor lawyer in history
to attain membership on this Court.
"Upon the outbreak of war in 1941, General William J. Donovan, set-
ting up the Office of Strategic Services, asked the young labor lawyer
from Chicago to establish an intelligence network that would draw on
union leaders in Germany, throughout occupied Europe, and around the
world. Goldberg assembled a staff made up at first of other labor law-
yers, many of whom later became members of this Bar.
"Most of the details of the OSS Labor Branch's activities are still
sealed in official obscurity. Its chief, who carried the rank of Major and
was based first in Washington, then in London, never talked much.
about his activities. We know that he was at Omaha Beach, in North
Africa and Egypt and Israel, and very close to the heavy water plants
in Norway. When asked, one of his lawyer associates, who was with the
first allied troops to cross the Bridge at Remagen-in order to protect
the Labor Branch's sources there-answers with characteristically re-
strained pride, 'Yes, I guess we were able to make a significant con-
tribution.' Those who shared this service with him recall a respect for
Arthur Goldberg rarely accorded a man in his middle thirties.
"At the end of the war, Goldberg and an OSS associate, Carl Devoe,
returned to Chicago, where Arthur resumed the representation of
workers and labor unions. On the occasion of the 40th anniversary.
of the firm they established, founder Goldberg would write:
"Our firm honored the precept that (the lawyer) is not meant to be
a servant of the client, . . . but to serve the client -a very differ-
ent thing. The committment of lawyers is the attainment of justice,
the ultimate goal of the rule of law. . . . If we are to realize (this)
goal, the law must be a flexible living instrument, . . . . a balance
wheel, not a brake.'
"Soon after his return to practice Goldberg became counsel to several
unions that had broken away from the American Federation of Labor
and formed the Congress of Industrial Organizations; he eventually
became General Counsel to the CIO itself. It was a protean situation
and his responsibilities were broad. They included a leadership role
in cleansing some of these unions of both corruption and communism,
which he insisted be done without compromising democracy's tenets.
"It was a noteworthy Goldberg characteristic that he always en-
larged his effectiveness by assembling around him extraordinarily com-

166

petent and highly principled associates. Naming any of them would risk
unfairness to others, except that they would all share the desire to rec-
ognize the lifelong participation in his achievements of his executive
assistant, Frances Simonson Guilbert.
"As advocates in this Court and others, Arthur Goldberg and his col-
leagues helped forge critical links in the law of collective bargaining.
Yet he counted litigation a last and poor resort. Almost constantly at
the center of controversy, he believed deeply in negotiation and agree-
ment as superior processes of dispute resolution. One of the nation's
most effective negotiators, he was respected equally by those on both
sides of the bargaining table. He was known, one commentator re-
ported after his death, as a ‘nice guy and a tough customer at the same
time.'
"Only in hindsight is it clear how far the contribution of labor lawyers
in the 1940s and '50s went beyond their services to immediate clients. A
century of judicial enjoining and penalizing of strikes, picketing, and
boycotts had engrained in workers and their unions a bitterness toward
the law. They also distrusted what they regarded as lawyers' fondness
for technicality and casuistry. Despite these obstacles, Arthur Gold-
berg and his colleagues at the labor bar, finding justice in the labor stat-
utes of the 1930s, managed to build among workers and their unions a
degree of confidence in the legal process.
"The Counsel for the Steelworkers and the CIO was a principal archi-
tect of the merger of American labor unions in 1955. He drafted the
crucial 'no-raiding' agreement. When a critical impasse developed
over a name for the new organization, symbolizing the divisions among
the parties, Goldberg broke the deadlock with an equally symbolic
resolution that committed future generations to the clumsy but egal-
itarian ‘American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial
Organizations.'
"Senator John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts had come to know Ar-
thur Goldberg and to respect him for both his advocacy of labor's inter-
est and his underlying independence of mind. In January of 1961, Gold-
berg became President Kennedy's first Secretary of Labor. Although
that term would prove to be short, its achievements led the official de-
partment historian to report recently that 'no other Secretary of Labor
has had as much influence on national labor policy as Goldberg.'
"In his first 90 days, Secretary Goldberg initiated the Extended Un-
employment Act of 1961; prepared a bill increasing the minimum wage
and another establishing the Manpower Development and Training
Program; drafted, with the Attorney General, an executive order set-

MONDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1990
167
ting up the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity;
prepared additional orders organizing the President's Labor-Manage-
ment Advisory Committee and a Committee on the Status of Women.
His clients in those three months included the unemployed, the poor,
minorities, and women. His brief was for justice and equality.
"Secretary Goldberg undertook and accomplished successfully, dur-
ing his 20 months in the Labor Department, the mediation of twelve.
national emergency labor disputes. Despite his previous professional
representation of workers' interests, his commitment to justice and
fairness, and his ability to bring those abstractions to the table, help
to account for his extraordinary success at mediation. To those who
criticized these efforts later as undue government intervention, he re-
plied simply: 'President Kennedy believed in an activist government to
protect the public interest. I shared this belief.'
"Arthur Goldberg's zeal for justice had shown itself in every facet
of his professional life. So it was appropriate that in August of 1962
President Kennedy nominated him to be an Associate Justice of this
Court. His selection was endorsed in the Senate, and more generally,
by acclamation.
"Shortly before Justice Goldberg was appointed to the Supreme
Court he described what he called the ‘liberal spirit' as an ‘attitude of
idealism based upon the possible.'
"Those few words capture Arthur Goldberg's tenure on the Court.
Few Justices in history have contributed so much in so short a time. His
idealism and his constantly fresh perspective combined with his superb
legal skills and diligent scholarship to produce a stream of opinions that,
from the very first, had an influence highly unusual for the newcomer to
the Court.
"Time after time, whether he was in the majority or concurring or in
the dissent, he offered new ideas and new applications based soundly in
values and traditions deeply rooted in our nation's history and comple-
mented by a sound sense of strategy. He seemed to know both intu-
itively and intellectually what would move the law along, not just from
the previous case to the current one, but down a path that would build
for the longer term.
"His writing ranged across the law, but it rang with greatest clarity
and power when he was expounding on the Constitution. When he
spoke on a constitutional issue before the Court, he repeatedly looked
both to history and posterity, whether the issue was assuring the right
of marital privacy or guaranteeing the right of a person accused of
crime to be questioned in the presence of his lawyer, limiting the use

168

of capital punishment or hastening the pace of desegregation, protect-
ing the right of people to criticize public officials or articulating ap-
propriate accommodations between church and state, vindicating the
rights of civil rights protesters or seeing that the status of citizenship
is not arbitrarily taken away.
-
"It would be difficult to identify Justice Goldberg's most important
opinion there were many, even in that brief span of time. One he felt.
strongly about was his concurrence in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381
U. S. 479 (1965), in which he made a powerful scholarly argument that
the Ninth Amendment shows the Framers' belief in fundamental per-
sonal liberties which are not specifically mentioned in the Bill of Rights.
He stressed that he was not arguing that the Ninth Amendment consti-
tutes an independent source of rights,' but rather that it 'shows
a belief of the Constitution's authors that fundamental rights exist
that are not expressly enumerated in the first eight amendments and
an intent that the list of rights included there not be deemed exhaus-
tive.' He sensed that Griswold was to be a critical stepping stone in con-
stitutional history, and his concurrence added weight to its impact
in later cases.
"Justice Goldberg's opinion for the Court in Escobedo v. Illinois, 378
U. S. 478 (1964), was an important step in the march to Miranda v.
Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966). Building on Gideon v. Wainwright, 372
U. S. 335 (1963), which held that every person accused of a crime is en-
titled to a lawyer at trial, he wrote for the majority that 'when the proc-
ess shifts from investigatory to accusatory-when its focus is on the ac-
cused and its purpose is to elicit a confession,' the adversary system is
in play, and the assistance of counsel becomes a constitutional
imperative.
"Justice Goldberg's remarkable blend of idealism and practicality was
reflected in his eloquent statement in Escobedo that 'no system of
criminal justice can, or should, survive if it comes to depend for its con-
tinued effectiveness on the citizens' abdication through unawareness of
their constitutional rights.' His opinion was grounded upon the practical
reality that the prosecutorial process is not just a judicial matter, but
begins when the defendant is in the hands of the police. The right to
counsel at trial, he wrote, would be hollow indeed if the trial is 'no more
than an appeal from the interrogation,' where advice of counsel is de-
nied. He referred in particular to the duty of the police to advise a de-
fendant of his right to remain silent, the key building block underlying
the decision in Miranda two years later.

"Justice Goldberg's initiative on capital punishment began a process
of great historical significance. After his first year on the Court, he de-
cided to circularize his colleagues on the issue. He prepared a long
memorandum to the entire Court expressing the view that the 'insti-
tutionalized taking of life by the state' was ‘barbaric and inhuman.'
Then, aware that most of the other Justices would want to proceed only
a step at a time if at all, he offered a more measured analysis broken.
down by type of crime and offender, to suggest categories of cases in
which imposition of the death penalty might more readily be found
unconstitutional.
"He never published the memorandum, but, joined by Justices Doug-
las and Brennan, he did publish a brief dissent to the denial of certiorari
in Rudolph v. Alabama, 375 U. S. 889 (1963), a case involving a black
man under sentence of death for the rape of a white woman. The effect
was as he had hoped. The civil rights and civil liberties communities un-
dertook a strategy to present the Court with a series of capital punish-
ment cases, which culminated with the decision in Furman v. Georgia,
408 U. S. 239 (1972).
"When Justice Goldberg joined the Court, nearly a decade had passed
since Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954), had been de-
cided. He, along with many others, was concerned that 'all deliberate
speed' had acquired much more emphasis on the 'deliberate' than on the
'speed.' During his first Term, a case arose, Watson v. Memphis, 373
U. S. 526 (1963), involving the pace of desegregation of parks and rec-
reational facilities in Memphis, Tennessee. Instead of simply deciding
that desegregating parks was not so exceptionally complex as to re-
quire the eight-year period the city was seeking, Justice Goldberg led a
unanimous Court in sending a broader message about the pace of deseg-
regation. He wrote 'Brown never contemplated. . . indefinite delay
in elimination of racial barriers in schools, let alone other public facili-
ties. . . . The rights here asserted are, like all such rights, present
rights; they are not merely hopes to some future enjoyment of some for-
malistic constitutional process.'
"Watson is only one among many important decisions in the post-
Brown history, but, as with so many Goldberg opinions, it made an im-
portant and eloquent statement that advanced the law significantly at a
strategically crucial moment.
"Justice Goldberg's original turn of mind often led him to concur, as
he did in Griswold, on the basis of a different theory from the one ad-
vanced in the majority opinion. For example, in New York Times Co. v.
Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254 (1964), joined by Justice Douglas, he said the

170
MONDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1990
majority's 'actual malice' standard was wrong. He believed the 'citizen
and the press' should have ‘an unconditional privilege to criticize official
conduct,' even if the privilege is sometimes abused. 'The prized Ameri-
can right 'to speak one's mind'. . . should not depend upon a probing by
the jury of the motivation' of the speaker, lest public debate and advo-
cacy be constrained. Subjecting the press to libel damages for criticiz-
ing official conduct would mean that ‘no critical citizen can safely utter
anything but faint praise about the government or its officials.'
"Justice Goldberg would, on the other hand, have allowed recovery
for defamatory statements against a public official when directed
against his private conduct and he would have done so on the basis of
the traditional libel standard rather than by the more restrictive 'actual
malice' approach. This was a distinction grounded both in Justice Gold-
berg's bent for the practical and in his idealism. Maintaining his belief in
the importance of individual privacy, he insisted equally on the broad-
est scope for criticism of official conduct. As time has passed, his posi-
tion in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan has, as a consequence, found
adherents among both the press and advocates of privacy.
"School District of Abington v. Schempp, 374 U. S. 203 (1963), the
public school Bible-reading case, led to another important concurrence.
Joined by Justice Harlan, Justice Goldberg worried that a rigid concept
of state neutrality would result in a brooding and pervasive devotion to
the secular and a passive, or even active, hostility to the religious.' He
agreed that devotional Bible-reading was unconstitutional, but said
'providing military chaplains' would not be.
"The opinion stressed that the constitutionally required aim is to find
the 'required and permissible accommodations between state and
church (to) frame the relation as one free of hostility or favor and pro-
ductive of religious and political harmony, but without undue involve-
ment of one in the concerns or practices of the other.' The Justice recog-
nized that 'the judgment in each case is a delicate one, ... but the
measure of constitutional adjudication is the ability and willingness to
distinguish between real threat and mere shadow.' His emphasis on the
need for accommodation in order to vindicate both the establishment
clause and the free exercise clause is an idea that has found favor in
recent First Amendment jurisprudence.
"In the early 1960s the Supreme Court was struggling with the issue
of how to handle trespass convictions for sit-in demonstrations pro-
testing whites-only policies of lunch counters and restaurants. Jus-
tice Goldberg wrote a concurrence in Bell v. Maryland, 378 U. S. 226

MONDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1990
171
(1964), a case in which the Court's disposition was to remand the matter
for further consideration by the Maryland courts in light of that state's
enactment of an equal-accommodations law. Marshalling impressive
historical evidence, as he often did, Justice Goldberg argued that the
'American commitment to equality' as manifested in the post-Civil War
constitutional amendments contemplated ‘that the states would con-
tinue, as they had for ages, to enforce the right of citizens to enter pub-
lic places,' and that a state's ""omission to protect" a person against
racially discriminatory exclusion constituted a denial of the equal pro-
tection of the laws. The question was in effect mooted by the passage
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Had the sit-in issue remained on the
front burner, however, Justice Goldberg's reasoning might well have
served as the groundwork for a decision invalidating convictions like
the one in Bell.
"Another enduring contribution came in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Marti-
nez, 372 U. S. 144 (1963), which he wrote when he had been on the
Court for less that five months. At issue was the validity of a statute
that deprived Americans of their citizenship if they left the country or
stayed away during a war or time of national emergency in order to
avoid military service. The Court was divided, and Justice Goldberg
was able to stitch together a majority on the theory that the statute
was 'penal in character. . . . (and) constituted governmental punish-
ment without due process of law and without the rights guaranteed all
those accused of crimes. . . .' It was an early example of the fresh but
sound approach that was characteristic of the Justice's work.
"Justice Goldberg's attention and superb legal skills were also fo-
cused intently on the innumerable non-constitutional issues that com-
prise the bulk of the cases that fill the federal courts and that must.
ultimately
be supervised by the Supreme Court. To these mundane but vital is-
sues of common law, procedure, and statutory interpretation, the Jus-
tice brought an intense professional interest, his years of practical ex-
perience as a litigator and advocate, and his sense of balance between.
literal directives and their purposes.
"In Foman v. Davis, 371 U. S. 178 (1962), which involved an applica-
tion of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure but has been cited in and
guided hundreds of unreported trial court decisions, a key issue was
whether, when, and why a complaint could be amended. Writing for the
Court, Justice Goldberg gave meaning to the fundamental principle
that the rules should be applied to grant litigants decisions on the mer-
its. By ruling that it was an abuse of discretion to refuse an amendment.

without an explicit or apparent reason, he placed the burden on the
party who sought to win without reaching the merits.
"In 1965 President Lyndon Johnson prevailed on Justice Goldberg to
leave the Court for the position of United States Ambassador to the
United Nations. He was sworn in as Ambassador by his good friend
Justice Hugo Black. The reluctance with which he left the Court is per-
haps suggested, poignantly, in his asking at the UN to be addressed
and referred to as Justice Goldberg.
"He continued as a diplomat his passionate pursuit of freedom and
justice for all people. He found at the United Nations, from 1965 to
1968, a world very different from the Court. Here was conflict in Cy-
prus, Kashmir, and the Middle East; diplomacy in the reelection of
U Thant as Secretary General; intrigue in the complex internal and ex-
ternal discussions relating to the war in Vietnam; international law in
the decision of the International Court of Justice regarding South Afri-
ca's stewardship of South West Africa.
"The Justice made the transition with ease. The situation called for
new knowledge, but no one could have come better prepared. Foreign
policy had long been among his most intense interests, and interna-
tional diplomacy was virtually second nature to him. He became deeply
immersed personally in all of the issues at the United Nations of con-
cern to the United States, more so perhaps than U. S. ambassadors be-
fore and after him. He impressed the foreign service officers who
worked closely with him by the degree to which he did his homework on
every issue, by the energy that he put into resolving the issues before
him, and by his negotiating skills.
"As one aide at the United States Mission to the United Nations ob-
served, the new ambassador ‘raised negotiation to an art form.' Until
he came to the UN, it had operated primarily in public-in the Security
Council or the General Assembly-where, once positions were taken,
there was little room for maneuvering. Justice Goldberg believed
strongly in negotiating positions and working out agreements as a
means of resolving disputes rather than taking hard and fast public
positions. A group of UN security guards commented once to a mem-
ber of Goldberg's staff on the changes he had brought to the modus.
operandi of the United Nations, noting that many of the delegates had
begun to engage in negotiation prior to meeting in the Security Council.
"These were not easy years in the community of nations, nor for the
foreign policy of the United States. Justice Goldberg experienced great
frustration, especially with regard to the moving target of peace in

MONDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1990
173
Southeast Asia. To his deep regret, it was impossible to control, and
ultimately to affect, the course of events from an office at the United
States Mission to the United Nations. The distance from Washington
was something no Cabinet title could overcome. He expressed nostalgia
for the Court and, especially, its tidy decision-making. He remarked on
more than one occasion that no one at the United Nations could say ‘it is
so ordered.'
"But there was triumph, too, especially in regard to the Middle East.
The U. S. Mission in New York did indeed function as a second State
Department during the 'Six-Day War' in June of 1967. And in the fall of
1967, there came the crowning achievement of Resolution 242, follow-
ing months of subtle and painstaking negotiations with all sides in the
Middle East dispute. This Resolution established a framework for a
lasting peace, an objective that ranked among the highest of Justice
Goldberg's public goals. He succeeded here because, as a represent-
ative of the United States, he was so believable. With knowledge of the
legal implications, credible access to high levels of U. S. political power,
and unusual insight into the reasoning and motivation of his counter-
parts, he was able to move the entire institution of the United Nations
to an extent most observers had thought impossible. Resolution 242
still remains, twenty-three years later, the framework for pursuing
peace in the Middle East.
"The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty offers another example of his
skill as a negotiator. In the early stages of the development of that
treaty, after the Eighteen Nation Disarmament Committee had pre-
pared the initial draft, the deputy foreign minister of the Soviet Union
came to New York to meet with Goldberg to ask if he would take over
the negotiations, inasmuch as the Soviet Union and its ambassador to
the UN had lost credibility with most of the ‘near-nuclear' and non-nu-
clear nations. With Justice Goldberg as chair, the ambassadors of the
eighteen nations met for two days of intensive negotiations. Then he
took the three principal holdouts aside and was able to negotiate com-
promise language that would get them to agree to the treaty. That
treaty is the product of his patience, his concern for the safety of the
world, his consummate skill as a negotiator, and his persistence.
"He negotiated patiently with Greek, Turkish, and Cypriot leaders to
forestall a war between Greece and Turkey over Cyprus. One all-night
session led to some imaginative approaches to defusing this very dan-
gerous situation at a time when both the White House and the State
Department were distracted by Vietnam and unable to recognize the
seriousness of what was about to happen in Cyprus.

MONDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1990
"Justice Goldberg took the unprecedented step of formally protesting
to the UN Commission on Human Rights against the suppression of
free speech in the Soviet Union through the secret trials and imprison-
ment of dissident writers. This reflected, as he stated it, his own
deep commitment to 'the belief that freedom of information and of ex-
pression are essential to the preservation and advancement of human
rights.' The idea of addressing the Commission originated with him and
not his aides or the State Department. Stating that ‘a trial for the crime
of writing a literary work. . . is an outrageous attempt to give the form
of legality to the suppression of a basic human right,' he noted that the
secret trials were in violation of Article 11 of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights. He then pointed out that, ironically, the acts for
which the accused were tried were protected not only by the Declara-
tion of Human Rights but also by the Soviet Constitution itself.
"Justice Goldberg took a strong stand with the State Department and
the White House on many issues where he felt that the spirit, if not
the letter, of agreements was being violated. Through the force of his
personality, his understanding of the legal issues involved, and the cor-
rectness of his position, he was able to get the State Department to
change its policy.
"Although Justice Goldberg was widely known to be unhappy with
American policy in Vietnam, he declined, at the time of his resignation,
to list any disagreement with Administration policy. His refusal to
dwell on what were profound differences, particularly over the bombing
of North Vietnam, was characteristic of his view that such differences
should be treated as 'within the family.' He resigned when it became
apparent that his voice was no longer persuasive in the inner policy-
making circles. At the time of his resignation, leading commentators
noted his recognition by UN ambassadors as one of the most effective of
those who have served as the American representative to the United
Nations. He had done much to help maintain peace in many unpubli-
cized ways and to ensure that the United States remained as much as
possible on the high road. His sense of justice and of ethics would
permit no less.
"Upon leaving the United Nations, Justice Goldberg initially re-
entered private law practice, but his innate activism continued to draw
him in many directions, always working for justice. In mid-1968 he
agreed to handle the appeal of the Reverend William Sloane Coffin, Jr.,
from his conviction for civil disobedience in opposition to the war in
Vietnam. The following year, he co-chaired, with former Attorney Gen-

eral Ramsey Clark, a commission of inquiry into the deaths of Black
Panther leaders in Chicago in a pre-dawn police department raid.
"In 1970 the Democratic Party drafted Justice Goldberg to be its can-
didate for Governor of New York. Following an unsuccessful campaign,
he moved back to Washington, to practice law and to serve, as a highly
active elder statesman,' those causes that seemed to him interesting
and worthwhile. He was President Jimmy Carter's Ambassador to the
Belgrade Conference on Human Rights. He argued the Curt Flood case
in the Supreme Court, trying to subject professional baseball to the
antitrust laws; represented federal judges in litigation seeking a pay
raise; served as Special Counsel to the Rhode Island Judicial Commis-
sion in a sensitive judicial ethics case; and spent considerable time mak-
ing a scholarly case that Klaus Barbie could still be brought to account
for crimes against humanity.
"Justice Goldberg found time to chair the American Jewish Commit-
tee and to be active in many Jewish causes. He helped Cardinal O'Con-
nor convince the Army to create standards of 'human rights' for en-
listed men. He chaired a committee to right the wrongs done to
Japanese citizens of the United States during World War II. He medi-
ated international disputes. And nearly every year he went to some col-
lege or law school to be a resident scholar and teacher, to introduce
young people to his beloved Constitution.
"The breadth and quality of this remarkable man's contributions to
his country were acknowledged in President Carter's conferring on him
in 1978 the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Yet saying today, as mem-
bers of this Bar, our final farewell, it cannot be inappropriate to recog-
nize that Arthur Goldberg prized above all else his opportunity to serve
as a member of this Court.
"He loved the Court. Sitting on this bench was the fulfillment of his
life's ambition. But he loved his country even more. His President told
him in 1965 that America needed his unique negotiating skills to further
the cause of peace. A son of immigrants and a deeply patriotic man, he
responded to that call. It was just that simple.
"Wherefore, it is accordingly
"Resolved, That we, the Bar of the Supreme Court of the United
States, express our profound sorrow that Associate Justice Goldberg is
no longer with us; we express our admiration for his dedication in carry-
ing the principles and standards of the legal profession into so many

letter of the law and to the effectuation of its purpose; we say once more

The Chief Justice said:
“Thank you, Mr. Solicitor General. The Court now recognizes the
Attorney General of the United States."
Mr. Attorney General Thornburgh addressed the Court as follows:
"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
"The Bar of this Court met today to honor the memory of Arthur
Joseph Goldberg, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court from 1962
to 1965.
"Arthur Goldberg served the Nation with distinction as a lawyer, sol-
dier, Cabinet officer, Supreme Court Justice, and diplomat. Born in
Chicago in 1908, he was educated in the Chicago public schools and at
Northwestern University, where he was first in his law school class and
Editor-in-Chief of the Law Review.
"By special dispensation, Arthur Goldberg sat for the Illinois bar
examination before he reached the age of 21. He was admitted to the
Illinois bar in 1929 and began a general law practice in Chicago. He
opened his own law office in 1933, and soon began handling labor mat-
ters for clients such as the United Steelworkers and the Chicago News-
paper Guild.
During World War II, Arthur Goldberg served under William J.
Donovan as Chief of the Labor Division in the Office of Strategic Serv-
ices. He carried out several intelligence missions to Europe, where
he organized transportation workers into a valuable Allied intelligence.
network.
"After the war, he resumed his law practice and soon gained recog-
nition as a preeminent labor lawyer. He served as general counsel to
the United Steelworkers from 1948 to 1961. As general counsel to the

MONDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1990
177
Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), Arthur Goldberg played a
major role in the merger of that organization and the American Federa-
tion of Labor in 1955. He remained as special counsel to the merged
AFL-CIO until 1961. During this period, he was active in efforts to rid
the unions of corruption. He made six oral arguments before this Court
in the 1950s, and was on the brief in many other cases. He argued as
amicus curiae in the Steel Seizure case, Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co.
v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579 (1952).'
"Arthur Goldberg was appointed Secretary of Labor by President
Kennedy in 1961. Secretary Goldberg employed his superb negotiating
skills to resolve labor conflicts that he regarded as jeopardizing national
interests. Within 24 hours after his swearing in by Chief Justice War-
ren, he was on his way to New York to mediate a harbor strike. This
pattern of personal mediation was repeated several times during his
months as Labor Secretary.
"Arthur Goldberg was nominated by President Kennedy to succeed
Justice Felix Frankfurter and sworn in on October 1, 1962. The seat he
occupied is a distinguished one, having been held by Benjamin Cardozo,
Oliver Wendell Holmes, and Joseph Story in addition to Justice Frank-
furter. It is now held by Justice Blackmun. Soon after his appointment,
the new Justice commented on the transition from life as a Secretary
of Labor to life as a Supreme Court Justice:
"The Secretary's phone never stops ringing; the Justice's phone
never rings even his best friends won't call him.
"The Secretary. . . worries about what the President and . . .
Congress will do to his carefully formulated legislative proposals;
the President, the Congress, and the Secretary wonder what the
Justice will do to theirs.
"The Secretary's. . . vacations are . . . interrupted by unantici-
pated strikes; the Justice's. . . long recess by an apparently end-
less flow of petitions for certiorari, difficult stay applications, and
the certitude that if he vacations too obviously he will be ‘time

charted' by Professor Hart and the editors of the Harvard Law
Review.'
"In his three Terms on the Court, Justice Goldberg delivered 94 opin-
ions, including 37 opinions for the Court, 23 concurrences, and 34 dis-
sents. His first opinion for the Court, in United States v. Loew's, Inc.,
371 U. S. 38 (1962), a complex antitrust case, revealed his high abilities
as a judicial craftman.3
"One of Justice Goldberg's most significant opinions came later in his
first Term. The Court held unconstitutional, as imposing punishment
without a criminal trial, a statute providing that persons who evaded
military service by remaining outside the jurisdiction of the United
States in time of war would automatically be deprived of citizenship.
Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144 (1963). In Gibson v.
Florida Legislative Investigation Committee, 372 U. S. 539 (1963), Jus-
tice Goldberg's opinion for the Court held that the committee could not
require the production of membership records of the NAACP absent
some showing of a connection between the NAACP and the Commu-
nists activities it was investigating. His opinion for the Court the fol-
lowing year in Aptheker v. Secretary of State, 378 U. S. 500 (1964), held
that a statute prohibiting any member of a Communist organization.
from applying for a passport was an unconstitutional infringement of
the right to travel.
"Justice Goldberg wrote noteworthy concurring opinions in a number
of other constitutional cases. In Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479
(1965), he expressed the view that the Ninth Amendment expanded the
concept of 'liberty' in the Due Process Clauses beyond those rights spe-
cifically enumerated in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. In New
York v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254 (1964), Justice Goldberg called for an
unconditional privilege to criticize the conduct of public officials. And in
Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States, 379 U. S. 241 (1964), his opin-
ion concluded that the public accommodations provision of Civil Rights

Arthur J. Goldberg 128-129 (1964).
This was the first of several antitrust opinions by Justice Goldberg. See FTC v.
Sun Oil Co., 371 U. S. 505 (1963); Silver v. New York Stock Exchange, 373 U. S.
341 (1963); United States v. Philadelphia Nat'l Bank, 374 U. S. 321 (1963). Justice
Goldberg also authored an opinion stating his view that the antitrust laws should not
apply to collective bargaining over wages, hours, and working conditions. See 381
U. S. 697 (opinion of Goldberg, J., in United Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381
U. S. 657 (1965) and Amalgamated Meat Cutters v. Jewel Tea Co., 381 U. S. 676

Act of 1964 was a valid exercise not only of Congress's power under the
Commerce Clause, as the Court held, but under Section 5 of the Four-
teenth Amendment as well.
"Many of Justice Goldberg's opinions addressed matters of criminal
procedure. Draper v. Washington, 372 U. S. 487 (1963), held that indi-
gents appealing criminal convictions are entitled to a transcript or other
account of the trial sufficient to permit review of their contentions on
appeal. Justice Goldberg also wrote a trio of decisions concerning the
sufficiency, under the Fourth Amendment, of affidavits used to obtain
search warrants.* Justice Goldberg's dissenting opinion in United
States v. Barnett, 376 U. S. 681 (1964), concluded that state officials
accused of disobeying orders of a federal court of appeals were entitled
to a jury trial. And in a memorandum circulated to the Conference in
1963, Justice Goldberg anticipated and addressed many of the death
penalty issues the Court would consider in the ensuing years.³
"Justice Goldberg's best-known opinion for the Court was in
Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478 (1964). The Court held that the
admission
of an incriminating statement made by Escobedo during the course of
police questioning violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. Al-
though the Sixth Amendment analysis of the Escobedo opinion was
later abandoned by the Court," Justice Goldberg's reasoning fore-
shadowed the Court's decision two years later in Miranda v. Arizona,
384 U. S. 436 (1966).
"Justice Goldberg also wrote several opinions in labor cases that
drew on his great knowledge and expertise in this field. In both NLRB
v. Metropolitan Insurance Co., 380 U. S. 438 (1965) (concerning bar-
gaining unit determinations), and American Ship Building Co. v.
NLRB, 380 U. S. 300, 327 (1965) (Goldberg, J., concurring in the re-

part).

The memorandum was published in 27 S. Tex. L. Rev. 493 (1986). In Rudolph
v. Alabama, 375 U. S. 889 (1963), Justice Goldberg dissented from the denial of cer-
tiorari in a case presenting the question whether the death penalty for rape is cruel
and unusual punishment forbidden by the Eighth Amendment. The Court addressed
this question 14 years later in Coker v. Georgia, 433 U. S. 584 (1977).
See Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U. S. 719, 729 (1966); see also Kirby v. Illinois,

sult) (concerning lockouts), he expressed a willingness to defer to deci-
sions of the National Labor Relations Board, but only so long as the
Board set forth reasons for its decision and the decision was supported
by substantial evidence in the record.
"In 1965, President Johnson prevailed upon Justice Goldberg to re-
sign from the Supreme Court to succeed Adlai Stevenson as United
States representative to the United Nations. In accepting the Presi-
dent's nomination, Justice Goldberg said that he could not 'conceal the
pain with which I leave the Court. . . . It has been the richest and
most satisfying period of my career.' And in a letter to his fellow
Justices,
he said that 'only the most compelling call to duty could bring me to
leave this Court. . . . But that call did come, and I could not refuse.'
382 U. S. ix. In his new post, Ambassador Goldberg confronted many
difficult issues relating to the conflict in Vietnam. He also played a role
in the adoption of Security Council Resolution 242 after the 1967 war in
the Middle East.
"Following his resignation from the U. N. post in 1968, Arthur Gold-
berg continued to contribute to public life as ambassador-at-large to the
United Nations, chairman of the U. S. delegation to a major conference
on the Helsinki human rights agreements, professor at several univer-
sities, and distinguished practicing lawyer. His final appearance before
this Court was in Flood v. Kuhn, 407 U. S. 258 (1972), an antitrust
challenge to professional baseball's reserve system. In 1978, he re-
ceived the Medal of Freedom, the Nation's highest civilian award.
"Appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee prior to his con-
firmation as a member of this Court, Arthur Goldberg said:
"I would regard the first function of a judge, whether he sits in
a trial court or an appellate court or in our highest tribunal, to
make sure as much as any human being can that he puts aside his
own prejudices, predilections, viewpoints, prejudices - which we
all possess and knowing that he possesses them, try to adminis-
ter justice equally under the law."
"Throughout his public life, Arthur Goldberg remained committed to
the rule of law. He recognized that 'the law gives form and substance to

the spirit of liberty.'" Justice Goldberg's tribute to Chief Justice
Warren is a fitting tribute to Arthur Goldberg himself: 'He did his part
in the sacred stir towards equal justice.'"
"Mr. Chief Justice, on behalf of the lawyers of this Nation and, in par-
ticular, of the Bar of this Court, I respectfully request that the resolu-
tions presented to you in honor and celebration of the memory of Jus-
tice Arthur Goldberg be accepted by the Court, and that they, together
with the chronicle of these proceedings, be ordered kept for all time in
the records of this Court.”
The Chief Justice said:
"Mr. Attorney General and Mr. Solicitor General, the Court thanks
you on behalf of the Bar for your presentations today in memory of our
late colleague and friend, Justice Goldberg.
"We ask that you convey to Chairman Wirtz and the members of the
Committee on Resolutions our profound appreciation for these very ap-
propriate resolutions. Your motion that these resolutions be made a
part of the permanent record of the Court is hereby granted.
"As the Attorney General's description indicates, the career of Ar-
thur J. Goldberg demonstrated a remarkable combination of intellectual
ability and dedication to public service. I was privileged to witness a
significant moment in that career in 1952, when I was serving in this
Court as a law clerk to Justice Robert Jackson. The Court was hearing
argument in the now famous 'Steel Seizure' case. Arthur Goldberg ar-
gued in that case as amicus curiae for the Steelworkers' Union. By
common consent among a most hypercritical audience-the assembled
law clerks of the Supreme Court - he did an excellent job. We were ap-
parently accurate in our assessment of his capabilities; seven years
later, when he argued again before the Court in a case which he actually
subsequently lost, the Justices informed him that they had not heard
any case argued more brilliantly that Term.
"Arthur Goldberg served on the Supreme Court for only three Terms
before leaving to become United States Representative to the United
Nations. In those three short years, as the Attorney General has told
us, he authored several significant opinions for the Court. Perhaps even
more important, however, is the outlook on constitutional law which he
brought to the Court. His succession to the seat of Felix Frankfurter
gave the 'Warren Court' a solid majority for an expansive reading

of the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses. Justice Goldberg
thereby gave his impetus to a judicial philosophy which was destined to
endure beyond his rather brief tenure here.
"The first time I had the opportunity to meet Arthur Goldberg was
in 1971, on the occasion of the funeral of Justice John Harlan. It was
my good fortune to sit next to him on a special plane which flew mem-
bers and former members of the Supreme Court to New York for the
funeral. During that delightful visit he talked freely of the various
public posts he had held. It was my distinct impression at that time
that, although he had enjoyed all of these jobs, he liked that of Associ-
ate Justice most of all. After his return to private practice, he continued
to take a lively interest in the work of the Supreme Court and the judi-
cial process as a whole. It is fitting that he should be remembered
today, in the Courtroom which was graced with his presence and among
the colleagues whose lives have been enhanced through their associa-
tion with him.
"Even in a country which is blessed with as many fine public servants
as our own, Arthur Goldberg stands out for the remarkable combina-
tion of intellect, versatility, and dedication which he displayed. Many
of us would be content to have functioned in one or maybe two of the
many positions which he occupied. Arthur Goldberg brought his tre-
mendous energy to all of them. Our country is fortunate to have been
enriched by the public service of this exceptional individual."

ORDER IN PENDING CASE
No. A-327. Janice G. Clark, et al., Applicants v. Charles "Buddy"
Roemer, Governor of Louisiana, et al. The application for an injunction
and stay of orders of the United States District Court for the Middle
District of Louisiana, case No. 86-435-A, presented to Justice Scalia
and by him referred to the Court is granted in part. Louisiana state offi-
cials are enjoined from holding elections scheduled for November 6 and
December 8, 1990, for judicial offices created by acts which the district
court found had not been precleared in violation of Section 5 of the Vot-
ing Rights Act of 1965. Specifically, these judgeships are those listed in
Section II of the district court's order of October 22, 1990, pages 3-4,
excepting Division B of the 20th Judicial District, which the district
court upon reconsideration found to have been precleared. See District
Court Oct. 31, 1990, order at 15 n. 42. In all other respects the applica-
tion is denied.
This order is further conditioned upon the timely docketing of a state-
ment as to jurisdiction in the above-entitled appeal. If such a statement
as to jurisdiction is filed, this order is to remain in effect pending this
Court's action on the appeal. If the judgments are affirmed, or the ap-
peal is dismissed, this order shall terminate automatically. In the event
probable jurisdiction is noted, or the judgments are vacated or re-
versed, this order shall remain in effect pending the sending down of
the judgment of this Court. Justice White dissents. Justice Blackmun,
concurring in part and dissenting in part: I would deny the application
in its entirety and therefore dissent from those provisions of the above
order which grant injunctive relief.

are enjoined from holding elections scheduled for November 6 and De-
cember 8, 1990, for judicial offices created by acts which the district
court found had not been precleared in violation of Section 5 of the Vot-
ing Rights Act of 1965. These judgeships are those listed in Section II
of the district court's order of October 22, 1990, pages 3-4, excepting
Division B of the 20th Judicial District, which the district court upon.
reconsideration found to have been precleared, and Division D of the

cally, those judgeships for which an election is enjoined are: (1) District

peal, District 1, Division C; (b) Second Circuit Court of Appeal, District
3, Division C. In all other respects the application is denied. This order
is further conditioned upon the timely docketing of a statement as to
jurisdiction in the above-entitled appeal. If such a statement as to juris-
diction is filed, this order is to remain in effect pending this Court's ac-
tion on the appeal. If the judgments are affirmed, or the appeal is dis-
missed, this order shall terminate automatically. In the event probable
jurisdiction is noted, or the judgments are vacated or reversed, this
order shall remain in effect pending the sending down of the judgment
of this Court. Justice White dissents. Justice Blackmun, concurring in
part and dissenting in part: I would deny the application in its entirety
and therefore dissent from those provisions of the above order which
grant injunctive relief.

whether we should overrule Booth v. Maryland, 482 U. S. 496 (1987)
and South Carolina v. Gathers, 490 U. S. 805 (1989), a question pre-
sented neither in the petition for certiorari nor in the response, is both
unwise and unnecessary. Cf. Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 485
U. S. 617, 622-623 (1988) (Stevens, J. dissenting). Moreover, the
Court's decision to review the alleged Booth error in this case would be
inappropriate in any event because the decision below rested alterna-
tively on the ground that any Booth violation that might have occurred.
was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See State v. Payne, 791
S. W. 2d 10, 19 (Tenn. 1990). Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.

petition, the parties are requested to brief and argue whether Booth v.
Maryland, 482 U. S. 496 (1987), and South Carolina v. Gathers, 490
U. S. 805 (1989), should be overruled. The petitioner's opening brief is
to be served and filed with the Clerk on or before March 18, 1991. Re-
spondent's brief is to be served and filed with the Clerk on or before
April 8, 1991. The case is set for oral argument during the April ses-
sion. Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Marshall and Justice Black-
mun join, dissenting: In my opinion, the Court's decision to expedite
the consideration of this case and to ask the parties to address whether
we should overrule Booth v. Maryland, 482 U. S. 496 (1987) and South
Carolina v. Gathers, 490 U. S. 805 (1989), a question presented neither
in the petition for certiorari nor in the response, is both unwise and
unnecessary. Cf. Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 485 U. S. 617,
622-623 (1988) (Stevens, J., dissenting). Moreover, the Court's decision
to review the alleged Booth error in this case would be inappropriate
in any event because the decision below rested alternatively on the
ground that any Booth violation that might have occurred was harmless
beyond a reasonable doubt. See State v. Payne, 791 S. W. 2d 10, 19
(Tenn. 1990). Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.
