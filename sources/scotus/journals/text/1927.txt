M. R. Chastain et al.;
No. 417. H. F. Ferry, plaintiff in error, v. A. L. Lloyd et al.; and
No. 418. C. L. Harris, as executor, etc., plaintiff in error, v.
A. L. Lloyd. Motion for counsel for the plaintiffs in error in each
of twelve similar cases to consolidate them all for hearing, as they
were consolidated in the Supreme Court of Kansas, on the ground
that the evidence in the cases is substantially the same, with direc-
tions to print the whole record in two of the cases and only so much
of the record in the remaining cases as is necessary to show the
difference between the cases. The counsel for certain of the defend-
ants in error in each of the cases contend that the printing of the
evidence as a part of the record is unnecessary and will needlessly
encumber the record and that the printing of such evidence would
be contrary to the rules of the Court. The motion to consolidate
and print is granted as proposed, the ultimate cost of printing, of
course, to await the event and the effect of any omission to print, to
be at the risk of the plaintiffs in error moving for the consolidation
and the limitation of printing.
No. 36. Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad Company, petitioner,
v. The State of Texas. On writ of certiorari to the Court of Civil
Appeals, Third Supreme Judicial District, State of Texas. Per
curiam: In this case, in which a certiorari was granted, the writ is
now vacated for the reason that the grounds advanced for the
granting of the writ prove, upon an examination of the record, not
to have a substantial basis. Southern Power Co. v. North Carolina
Public Service Co., 263 U. S. 508; Houston Oil Co. v. Goodrich,
245 U. S. 440; United States v. McFarland, No. 157, decided October
17, 1927.
In this case exception is taken by one of counsel for the respond-
ent to seven pages of a reply brief filed by one of counsel for the
petitioner. The matter excepted to is an effort by counsel for the
petitioner to minimize and detract from the weight of a supple-
mental record which the Court permitted to be filed by a recital
་

MONDAY, OCTOBER 31, 1927
90
of correspondence and communications between opposing counsel
with an intimation that, contrary to an agreement, no opportunity
had been furnished to oppose the filing. Respondent's counsel asks
that this brief be stricken from the files as improper. The motion
is granted. The supplemental record was filed by order of the
Court. No motion was made to have the order revoked or the
record stricken off the files. We can not approve of this insinuat-
ing and irregular method of reflecting on opposing counsel and on
the relevancy and weight of a document which the Court has
permitted to be filed.
No. 72. Fordson Coal Company, plaintiff in error, v. John M.
Moore, successor to John M. Johnson, Sheriff of Pike County. In
error to the Court of Appeals of the State of Kentucky. Per
curiam: The writ of error is dismissed on the authority of section
237 of the Judicial Code, as amended by the act of February 13,
1925 (43 Stat. 936, 937), for lack of jurisdiction. Jett Bros. Dis-
tilling Company v. City of Carrollton, 252 U. S. 1, 5, 6. Treating
the writ of error as an application for certiorari, the certiorari is
denied for want of a substantial federal question on the authority
of Shulthis v. McDougal, 225 U. S. 561, 569; Hull v. Burr, 234 U. S.
712, 720; Norton v. Whiteside, 239 U. S. 144, 147.

of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the State of Oklahoma. Per

The judgment of the Supreme Court was entered March 22, 1927.

18, 1927, an application for leave to file a second petition for rehear-
ing was endorsed:
"Leave granted to file-Fred C. Branson, Chief Justice."
"On August 2, 1927, as appears from the minutes, the following
proceedings were taken by the court:
"Gypsy Oil Company v. Escoe, et al. Application for leave to file
a second petition for rehearing denied; application for oral argument
denied. Fred C. Branson, Chief Justice."
On September 30, 1927, more than three months after denial of
the petition for rehearing (June 14), the present petition for cer-
tiorari was filed.
The running of the time within which proceedings may be initiated
here to bring up. judgment or decree for review is suspended by the

seasonable filing of a petition for rehearing. But it begins to run
from the date of denial of such petition and further suspension can
not be obtained by the mere presentation of a motion for leave to
file a second request for rehearing. Morse v. United States, 270
U. S. 151, 153, 154.
If, however, a timely motion for leave to file the second petition
is granted, and the petition is actually entertained by the Court, then
the time within which application may be made here for certiorari
begins to run from the day when the Court denies such second
petition.

No. 89. E. B. Bliss Company, petitioner, v. The United States.
On writ of certiorari to the Court of Claims. The judgment and
order entered herein on November 29, 1927, is hereby revoked, and
the following is now substituted in its stead:
This Court is of opinion that the Secretary of the Navy had
authority to make further contracts to pay the petitioner the in-
creased cost resulting from the wage increases put into effect at the
Secretary's instance, in the course of the petitioner's performance
of the original contracts, and that the findings of the Court of Claims
show that such further contracts were made and were based upon
an adequate consideration, consisting of both advantage to the Gov-
ernment and detriment to the petitioner. The findings on other
points are not such as to enable this Court finally to dispose of the
case. Accordingly the judgment of the Court of Claims is reversed
and the cause is remanded to that Court with directions (1) to make
further findings (a) as to whether the instruments of release express
the actual intention of the parties in respect of a settlement or release
of the petitioner's claim for increased cost resulting from putting
into effect the increased wages, or whether through mutual mistake,
duress, or other sufficient ground for reformation the instruments
of release were so drawn and signed that they failed to express the
actual intention of the parties in that respect, and (b) as to what
amount of increased cost to the petitioner resulted from the wage
increases as respects work done under the original contracts after the
wage increases took effect; (2) to make these findings from the evi-
dence already taken and any additional evidence which the Court of
Claims may deem it proper to receive; (3) to allow any amendments
of the pleadings which may be needed to present the question

MONDAY, DECEMBER 12, 1927
147
whether the instruments of release should be reformed to express
the actual intention of the parties in the particular herein named;
and (4) to render such judgment in the cause as may be appropriate
in view of the amended pleadings and the supplemented findings.
The mandate herein shall issue forthwith.

MONDAY, JANUARY 9, 1928
165
corpus was entered on February 1, 1926; an appeal was allowed
on February 9, 1926, to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit, which court, on December 14, 1926, entered a judg-
ment affirming that of the District Court. A writ of certiorari was
granted by this Court on March 7, 1927.
It appearing that Henry H. Curran, sued herein as Commissioner
of Immigration, resigned such office on March 31, 1926, and was
succeeded by Benjamin M. Day, who now holds that office, and that
no motion was made under section 11 of the act of February 13, 1925
(c. 229 43 Stat. 936, 941), asking the Court to "permit the cause to
be continued and maintained by or against the successor in office of

tion to dismiss the cause as abated.

petitioner and respondent to show cause in printed form, if any
cause there be, on or before Monday, January 23, 1928, why this
writ of certiorari should not be dismissed for want of jurisdiction,
on the ground that the decree sought to be reviewed is not a final
decree within the meaning of section 237 (b) of the Judicial Code,
in that it appears that Myron T. Herrick, one of the defendants, has
appeared and answered the bill of complaint, and that the cause is
still pending as to the said Herrick in the Supreme Court of the
State of New York, and therefore has not been finally and completely
determined.
No. 6, original. The State of Oklahoma, complainant, v. The State
of Texas, the United States of America, intervener. It is hereby
ordered by the Court that a rule be issued to the States of Texas and
Oklahoma and to the United States to show cause in printed form
if any cause there be, on or before Monday, February 20, 1928, why
the decree entered in this cause on January 3, 1927, should not be
amended by changing the clause 1 thereof so as to read as follows:
1. The boundary between the State of Texas and the State of Okla-
homa constituting the eastern boundary of the panhandle of Texas
and the main western boundary of Oklahoma, is the line of the true
one-hundredth meridian of longitude west from Greenwich, extending
north from its intersection with the south bank of the South Fork of
Red River to its intersection with the line of the parallel of 36 degrees
30 minutes north latitude, as surveyed and marked by John H. Clark,
United States commissioner, under the act of June 5, 1858, c. 92,
which was confirmed as the northern boundary of the State of Texas

of America; and
No. 533. Edward H. McInnis, petitioner, v. The United States of
America. Orders were entered on November 21, 1927, denying peti-
tions for certiorari in these cases. Thereafter a petition for rehear-
ing in No. 533 was denied January 3, 1928, and a similar petition has
been filed in No. 532. This Court now reconsiders all these three
petitions for certiorari and grants the writs therein, limiting their
consideration, however, to the question whether the use of evidence
of private telephone conversations, between the defendants and
others, intercepted by means of wire tapping, is a violation of the
fourth and fifth amendments and, therefore, not permissible in the
Federal courts.

Decree reversed in part and affirmed in part, and cause remanded
to the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District
of Virginia for further proceedings in conformity with the opinion
of this Court. Opinion by Mr. Justice Holmes.
Ex parte: In re Abraham S. Gilbert. Under our order of No-
vember 21, 1927, the clerk issued a rule to the respondent, Abraham
S. Gilbert, of New York City, a member of this bar, which directed
that he make written report to this Court showing what fees or
allowances have been paid to him (also when and by whom paid)
for services as master in the several causes reviewed here during the
October term, 1921, and reported in 259 U. S. 101, under the follow-
ing titles: Newton, as Attorney General of the State of New York,
et al., v. Consolidated Gas Company of New York; Same v. New
York & Queens Gas Company; Same v. Central Union Gas Com-
pany; Same v. Northern Union Gas Company; Same v. New York
Mutual Gas Light Company; Same v. Standard Gas Light Com-
pany of the City of New York; Same v. New Amsterdam Gas Com-
pany; Same v. East River Gas Company of Long Island City.
That he likewise report whether he has returned or repaid any
portion of the fees or allowances received by him as such master
with dates and names of the parties.

That if he has received fees or allowances as master in any of the
specified causes exceeding the maximum amount held by us to be
permissible, and has not returned or repaid the excess, then he shall
show cause why his name ought not to be stricken from the roll of
attorneys permitted to practice here and he be punished for con-
tempt or otherwise dealt with as the circumstances may require.
On the return day, January 16, 1928, Gilbert presented himself,
filed a written report, and was heard through counsel.
He asserts that he received as fees for services as master in the
eight above-mentioned causes a total of $118,000; he sets out their
several amounts and shows by whom and when they were paid. He
avers that no one of the gas companies which paid these fees has ever
questioned the amount or asked return of any portion, and says
that he believes it was proper for him to retain them, notwithstand-
ing they greatly exceeded what we declared permissible. But he
further says that if this Court, after viewing his response, should
conclude that he is under legal or moral obligation to return any part
of them, he is willing so to do.
In December, 1921, the District Court for the Southern District
of New York made allowances to respondent for services as master
in each of the above-mentioned causes and directed that they be paid
by the complaining corporations, respectively, and thereafter taxed
as costs against the defendants, the Attorney General of New York,
and others. In obedience to such orders, and before the time for
appeal expired, these were paid, as follows: By Consolidated Gas
Co., Dec. 13, 1921, $57,500; by N. Y. & Queens Gas Co., Dec. 16,
1921, $12,500; by Central Union Gas Co., Dec. 16, 1921, $12,500; by
Northern Union Gas Co., Dec. 13, 1921, $7,500; by N. Y. Mutual Gas
Light Co., Dec. 16, 1921, $11,500; by Standard Gas Light Co., Jan.
13, 1922, $7,500; by New Amsterdam Gas Co., Jan. 13, 1922, $4,500;
by East River Gas. Co., Jan. 13, 1922, $4,500.
The Attorney General and other defendants insisted that the
allowances were excessive. The District Court overruled their ob-
jections; the matter came here and was decided May 15, 1922, 259
U. S. 101. We held that in the Consolidated Gas Company's case.
twice too much had been allowed and in the other causes three times
too much that the total compensation should not exceed $49,250.
And, further, that in making these awards the District Court abused
its judicial discretion. Accordingly, we reversed the challenged
decrees and remanded the causes with instructions to fix respondent's
compensation within the following limitations: "In the cause wherein
the Consolidated Gas Company is appellee here (No. 750) not ex-
ceeding $28,750-one-half of the amount heretofore allowed; in
each of the other seven causes, Nos. 751, 752, 753, 832, 833, 844,
and 845, not exceeding one-third of the amount heretofore allowed

-
MONDAY, JANUARY 23, 1928
185
therein; and in the eight cases allowances totaling not more than
$49,250." We also directed "such further action in conformity with
this opinion as may be necessary."
Upon receipt of the mandates, issued here June 19, 1922, the
District Court ordered that the master's fees to the extent of the
maximum permitted by us should be taxed against the several defend-
ants as costs. Respondent made no effort to secure any further
orders or direction by the District Court or this Court.
More than a year thereafter-December, 1923-apparently moved
by published criticisms, respondent instituted a proceeding against
the Consolidated Gas Company in the Supreme Court of New York
under section 473, New York Civil Practice Act, wherein he sought
and obtained a declaratory judgment reciting that that company had
no valid claim against him for return of any part of the $57,500
which it had paid. This proceeding was ill-advised, or worse, and
the pronouncement therein can not aid him here. The State court
had no power to determine the matter now before us.
Upon announcement of our opinion, May 15, 1922, it became the
imperative duty of respondent immediately to return the fees re-
ceived by him so far as they exceeded what we declared permissible.
It is now his duty, without further delay, to return this excess with
interest thereon at 6 per centum from May 15, 1922.
When respondent accepted appointment as master he assumed the
duties and obligations of a judicial officer. He could not rightfully
accept or retain anything as compensation unless sanctioned by
proper order of court. Reception then or now of a gratuity from
any party would be indefensible, and whether or no the corporations
which paid him by direction of the court are satisfied with the result
is now unimportant. He has long been an attorney and counsellor
authorized to practice at this bar under the sanction of an oath to
demean himself "uprightly, and according to law." Notwithstand-
ing the adjudication here that excessive fees had been allowed by
orders granted in abuse of judicial discretion, he has retained them
for more than five years. He knew that he had got unearned money
by improper orders of court, but he decided to keep it. Such conduct
is far from "upright and according to law" within the fair intend-
ment of those terms.
Further action will be postponed until Monday, February 20, 1928.
The respondent will present himself at that time and report in writ-
ing concerning efforts made to comply with his obligations. Opinion
by Mr. Chief Justice Taft.

ORDER
Whereas there is now in the hands of the clerk of this Court an
accumulated fund of $7,403.49, which represents balances owing to
litigants out of monies paid in to meet anticipated costs in cases
which, although pending when the payments were made, were
finally disposed of before the opening of the October Term, 1922;
and
Whereas these monies have remained unclaimed up to the present
time; and
Whereas the clerk has made diligent but unsuccessful efforts to
find the several claimants to the end that the monies might be paid
over to them;
It is ordered: 1. The clerk of this Court shall forthwith give
public notice by publication once a week for three consecutive weeks
in four daily newspapers of wide circulation, one of which shall be a
newspaper published in the city of Washington, to the effect that all
persons claiming to be entitled to any part of the monies hereinbefore
described are required to present their claims on or before the 15th
day of May, 1928, and that all of such monies to which no valid claim
is presented before that date will be disposed of as hereinafter
provided.
2. All of such monies to which no valid claim is presented within
the time so prescribed shall be paid by the Clerk into the Treasury
of the United States, to be there held and disposed of as is or may
be hereafter provided by law.
3. This order shall not relieve any litigant against whom costs
were adjudged from the obligation to pay the same where that obliga-
tion has not been performed; nor shall it affect the right of a litigant
in whose favor they were adjudged to receive them when paid.

No. 154. John W. Blodgett v. Charles Holden, Collector of In-
ternal Revenue.
It is hereby ordered that the opinion in Cause No. 154 of the
present term, John W. Blodgett v. Charles Holden, Collector of
Internal Revenue, on certificate from the United States Circuit Court
of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, heretofore handed down, be modi-
fied and made to read in the following manner:
By the Court: An equal division of opinion among the eight
Justices who heard and considered this matter renders it impossible
categorically to answer certified question No. 2. The other two ques-
tions, we think, are not essential. The statements of views by the
Justices are enough to show that the tax exacted of Blodgett can
not be sustained under sections 319-324 of the revenue act of 1924,
and they will enable the Circuit Court of Appeals readily to reach a
proper decision. The cause will be remanded there for appropriate
action.
The opinion of Mr. Justice McReynolds is amended by striking out
the words "And the question is so answered," and by adding thereto
"The Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Van Devanter, and Mr. Justice
Butler concur in this opinion."
The opinion of Mr. Justice Holmes is concurred in by Mr. Justice
Brandeis, Mr. Justice Sanford, and Mr. Justice Stone.
ORDER
On the application of the Clerk, pursuant to section 221 of the
Judicial Code, it is ordered that Horatio Stonier be, and he is hereby,
appointed a deputy clerk of this Court.

No. 841. Wallace C. Gaines, plaintiff in error, v. The State of
Washington. In error to the Supreme Court of the State of Wash-
ington. Per curiam: Upon examination of the record herein sub-
mitted, the Court finds that this is not a case in which there is
drawn in question the validity of a treaty or statute of the United
States and the decision is against its validity; or where is drawn
in question the validity of a statute of the State of Washington, on
the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or
laws of the United States, and the decision is in favor of its validity.
It is, therefore, not a case which, under section 237 (a) of the Judicial
Code as amended by the act of February 13, 1925 (43 Stat. 936, 937),
may be reviewed by this Court on writ of error, and this Court has no

938) the clerk is directed to issue an order returnable April 23 next

be denied for lack of a substantial federal question shown in the
record giving this Court jurisdiction.

the validity of a statute of the State of Texas, on the ground of its
being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United

error is therefore dismissed on the authority of section 237 (a) of

No. 941. James Walter Grigg, petitioner, v. The United States of
America; and
No. 953. Sidney B. Sligh, petitioner, v. The United States of
America. On petitions for writ of certiorari to the United States
Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. These are applica-
tions for certiorari in actions instituted in the United States District
Court for the District of Arizona to recover on policies of war-risk
insurance. There being then no applicable Federal statute of limita-
tions, the United States, among other defenses, pleaded the statute
of limitations of the State of Arizona. Judgments were entered in
the District Court for the plaintiffs. The United States sued out
writs of error to the Circuit Court of Appeals. That court held the
State statute of limitations was applicable and barred the actions and
reversed the judgments of the District Court.
On May 29, 1928, there was passed and approved an act of Con-
gress entitled "An act to amend the world war veterans' act, 1924"
(H. R. 13039, 70th Cong., 1st sess.). That act amends section 19 of
the world war veterans' act and allows suit to be brought on policies
of war-risk insurance within six years after the right accrues or
within one year from the date of the approval of the amendatory
act. It provides also:
"Judgments heretofore rendered against the person or persons
claiming under the contract of war-risk insurance on the grounds
that the claim was barred by the statute of limitations shall not be a
bar to the institution of another suit on the same claim. No State
or other statute of limitations shall be applicable to suits filed under
this section. This section shall apply to all suits now pending
against the United States under the provisions of this section."
As a result of this legislation, the defense of the statute of limita-
tions of Arizona is no longer available to the United States in these
two cases. In each case the assignments of error in the Circuit
Court of Appeals passed only on the defense of the statute of
limitations and did not find it necessary to consider the other
questions.
The United States now consents that writs of certiorari may be
issued forthwith in these cases, that the judgments entered in the
United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit be
vacated and set aside, and that the cases be remanded to the United
States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit for further
proceedings and that the mandates issue forthwith.
The Court enters the order accordingly.
