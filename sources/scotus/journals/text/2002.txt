  Adjourned until this afternoon at 3:00 o’clock.


   Present: Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice Stevens, Justice O’Connor,
Justice Scalia, Justice Souter, Justice Thomas, Justice Ginsburg, and
Justice Breyer.
   The Chief Justice said:
   “The Court is in special session this afternoon to receive the resolu-
tions of the Bar of the Court in tribute to our late colleague and friend,
Justice Byron R. White.
   “The Court recognizes the Solicitor General.”
   The Solicitor General addressed the Court as follows:
   “Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
   “At a meeting today of the Bar of this Court, resolutions memorializ-
ing our deep respect and affection for Justice White were unanimously
adopted. With the Court’s leave, I shall summarize the resolutions and
ask that they be set forth in their entirety in the records of the Court.
   “Those of us who argued before Justice White, representing all
shades of opinion at the bar, respected his impeccable preparation and
acute interrogations. We realized that oral argument was not simply a
tribute that tradition paid to due process but, at least for him, a means
for clarifying his understanding of the case in all of its ramifications.
Many of us feared his questions far more than the arguments of our
adversaries. He cut to the heart of a case, but also sharply identified
the consequences of a theory that was more convenient than durable.
Lawyers who refused to come face to face with what he viewed to be
the pivotal issue in a case could be met with a withering stare or
abrupt dismissal. Yet his questioning was never cruel or punitive. He
expected the best presentation from the best advocates, and he mani-
fested compassion for those who had been propelled by their cases from
run-of-the-mine practice in local courts to the unfamiliar terrain of the
highest court in the country.
   “When he was asked at his confirmation hearings to define the con-
stitutional role of the Supreme Court, he replied simply: ‘to decide
cases.’

   “To those who watched and read his work over three decades, the
statement was a credo. He saw the appropriate limits of his position
more readily than its dramatic possibilities. The habit of mind that
invoked constant questioning and probing could, and did, produce re-
consideration in the light of changes in other doctrinal areas or in the
development of the law that vexes judges most, the law of unintended
consequences. But when the dots of more than a thousand opinions are
connected, unmistakable patterns emerge. Two stand out in bold clar-
ity: respect for the scope of congressional power and skepticism over
the occasional primacy exercised by the judges in addressing social
issues through their authority over the constitutional text.
   “Perhaps no Justice in the second half of the twentieth century was
more committed to a generous understanding of Article I than Justice
White, and none spoke more forcefully defending congressional author-
ity in cases involving separation of powers.
   “He reserved his most eloquent defense of judicial restraint for the
occasions when the courts were invited to use their authority to create
novel constitutional rights under the rubric of the due process clauses.
Both themes rested on an intellectual foundation committed to the rule
of law. He believed in law, both as an authoritative expression of the
social will through the legitimate organs of government and as central
to the vitality of a free society. He did not view the courts as first
among equals in law-making: those directly responsible to the elector-
ate, be they town council or legislature, bore the first burden and the
ultimate responsibility for mediating the often conflicting desires of a
community. And in an age when cynicism toward government became
endemic, Justice White believed in the good faith of police officers,
school boards, local officials, juries and administrators charged with a
public trust. Public officials, without exception, were accountable under
law for transgressions, but they were allowed a practical discretion to
perform their civic duties.
   “Justice White had an enormous impact in a number of areas other
than those already mentioned, including jurisdiction, criminal proce-
dure, procedural due process, the First Amendment, labor law, anti-
trust, and federal pre-emption. He was a team player who incessantly
sought opportunities to contribute to the institutions and enterprises
to which he attached himself. He esteemed public service as a lawyer’s
highest calling and warmly encouraged clerks, students, and friends to
contribute their talents and energies to the common good. Service was,
for him, its own reward. Few public figures in recent memory have
cared so little about their popularity or even the judgment of history:

he measured himself by his own extraordinary standards, filled each
‘unforgiving minute with sixty seconds worth of distance run,’ and was
satisfied that ultimate judgment lay beyond temporal realms.
   “Although he guarded his personal privacy energetically, he was not
withdrawn: his acts of kindness and compassion, especially in times of
personal crises, touched many here and elsewhere but were, by instinct
and design, seen by few. And at his heart’s deep core, always, was his
family—his devoted wife of more than a half-century, Marion, his two
children, Charles Byron (Barney) White, and Nancy Lippe, and six
grandchildren, who remember him as ‘Grandpa Justice.’
   “Those among us who knew him have not yet entirely reconciled our
loss. We miss his generous sympathy and broad comprehension of the
world, his indefatigable curiosity, his warmth, his wickedly dry sense of
humor, and, for some of us lucky enough to know him well, his crushing
handshake, which focused his strength, friendship, and intensity into
one bracing moment. We are comforted with the thought that death
takes a man but does not fully extinguish a life, that he lives on in his
family, in his vast legion of close friends, in others whom he touched,
and in still others for whom he was a courageous public servant who
never flinched when the stakes were the greatest.
   “On behalf of the Bar of the Supreme Court, it is my privilege to
present to the Court the resolutions adopted today so that the Attor-
ney General may move their inscription on the Court’s permanent
record.”

                           “RESOLUTION”
     “The members of the Bar of the Supreme Court have met today
to honor the memory of Byron R. White, Associate Justice of the Su-
preme Court of the United States, who died April 15, 2002, in Denver,
Colorado, and to record their appreciation of the man and of the pub-
lic servant.
   “When President John F. Kennedy nominated him to the Court, the
President declared that Byron White had ‘excelled in everything he
has attempted—in his academic life, in his military service, in his ca-
reer before the Bar, and in the federal government.’ ‘Few among us
deserve such accolades,’ Justice Lewis F. Powell would later observe,
‘but President Kennedy did not exaggerate Byron White’s
achievements.’
   “Byron Raymond White was born June 8, 1917, in Fort Collins, Colo-
rado, but grew up in the small town of Wellington eleven miles away.
His father managed a lumber yard. Wellington’s economy was domi-

nated by sugar beets, a crop demanding constant attention and back-
breaking work, and both White and his older brother, Clayton S. (Sam)
White, worked beet fields after school and during the summer from
the time they could wield a hoe. Winters were harsh, spring brought
strong winds off the front range, and summers were hot and dry. Char-
acter was shaped in the relentless competition between the land and
the elements: self-reliance was not an abstraction.
   “By graduating first in his class from the tiny local high school, like
his brother before him, Byron White earned a full-tuition scholarship
to the University of Colorado. There he was a star in three sports
(football, basketball, baseball), president of the student body, a junior
selection to Phi Beta Kappa, and, again like his brother before him, a
Rhodes Scholar. His performance during his senior year is still statisti-
cally one of the most impressive in the history of intercollegiate foot-
ball, capped by All-America honors and brilliant play in the second
Cotton Bowl. So great was the press interest in the young scholar-
athlete that the New York Basketball Writers’ Association created the
first National Invitational Basketball Tournament largely as a show-
case for White and his teammates. White delayed his matriculation at
Oxford to accept the highest salary ever offered to a player in the
National Football League. Following the 1938 season, he spent two
terms at Oxford studying law, but he returned home when World War
II broke out in September 1939. He spent a year at Yale Law School,
won the Cullen Prize for the highest grades in his first year, then took
a leave of absence in each of the two succeeding fall terms to continue
to play professional football, which financed his legal education, helped
support the medical education of his older brother, and provided a re-
tirement nest egg for his parents.
   “With the onset of World War II, White tried to enlist in the Marine
Corps with the objective of becoming a fighter pilot, but he failed the
colorblindness test and had to settle for Naval intelligence. He served
with distinction, especially on Admiral Arleigh M. Burke’s staff, and
was awarded a Bronze Star. He provided intelligence analysis that was
critical to the success of the Battle of Leyte Gulf in 1944, and Burke
later wrote that White’s performance when the U.S.S. Bunker Hill was
burning at sea represented the epitome of courage, physical strength,
and selflessness in a crisis. After the war, White returned to Yale,
where he graduated first in his class and proceeded to a clerkship with
Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson during October Term 1946. The Term

included a number of watershed cases that would serve, in ways he
could not then imagine, as a precursor to future duty when he became
the first former clerk to be appointed to the Court.
   “When the clerkship ended, White faced the choice of where to prac-
tice law. Many of his fellow clerks stayed in Washington, but the pull
of home and family was too strong, and he returned to Colorado to
practice in Denver. His marriage to Marion Lloyd Stearns, daughter of
the President of the University of Colorado, on June 15, 1946, meant
that all of his extended family were within a 50-mile radius of Denver,
as were a wealth of friends and the favored pastimes of his youth,
especially fly-fishing and hiking in the foothills. For more than a dec-
ade, White enjoyed a widely varied practice ranging from real estate,
corporate work, antitrust, and labor law to tax and litigation, including
complex antitrust cases and simple one-day trials. He represented
large businesses, such as Boettcher & Company, the Denver National
Bank, and the Ideal Cement Company, as well as small companies and
individuals. He also devoted enormous amounts of time to community
service, including the Social Science Foundation at Denver University,
Boy Scouts of America, the Urban League, the Denver Welfare Coun-
cil, the YMCA, the Denver and Colorado Bar Associations, and the
Denver Chamber of Commerce, and to numerous charities, principally
the United Fund, Camp Chief Ouray for Children, the Rhodes Trust,
and Rose Memorial Hospital. A registered Democrat, he declined con-
stant invitations to stand for public office and confined his political
work to the grass-roots level. He once confided to a friend that he
thought he could get elected to office, ‘Once.’ Too committed to his
convictions, often too stubborn to compromise, and too disinclined to
accommodate the press, he knew he was better placed behind the
scenes than capitalizing on his early fame.
   “When Senator John F. Kennedy decided in 1959 to seek the Demo-
cratic nomination for President, his staff solicited White to manage the
campaign in Colorado. The Senator was not well known in the West
and his voting record on agricultural and reclamation issues did not
endear him to those whose livelihoods depended on generous federal
policies governing crop prices and water. White, who had known Ken-

nedy first in England when Kennedy’s father was Minister to the Court
of St. James and then later when both were PT officers in the South
Pacific, accepted the challenge and helped Kennedy make a respectable
showing in the state party convention. At the national convention in
Los Angeles, White became close to Robert F. Kennedy. When the
Senator secured the nomination, White was named national chair of
Citizens for Kennedy-Johnson. As a practical matter, the position pro-
vided Robert Kennedy with the daily opportunity to consult White for
advice on campaign tactics and strategy as well as the welter of person-
nel judgments required by a national campaign.
   “After Senator Kennedy was elected, White was named Deputy At-
torney General. His first task was to recruit the Assistant Attorneys
General who would be the front-line officers in the Department of Jus-
tice. When White finished the task, Alexander Bickel said that ‘[I]t was
the most brilliantly staffed department we had seen in a long, long
time’ and that the quality of personnel bespoke a ‘vision of public serv-
ice that would have done anyone proud.’ White also exercised unprece-
dented independence from Senatorial prerogative in approving United
States Attorneys, and once they were in office he monitored their
major cases more closely than any of his predecessors had. In addition
to making staffing decisions, he was responsible for supervising the
vetting of more than one hundred judges nominated during the admin-
istration’s first year. He received national attention during the Free-
dom Riders Crisis in May of 1961, when he organized and directed an
ad hoc contingent of heroic federal officers to protect Dr. Martin Lu-
ther King and his supporters who faced life-threatening hostility to
their protests against racial segregation.
   “When Justice Charles Evans Whittaker retired a year later, Byron
White became President Kennedy’s first appointment to the Supreme
Court on April 3, 1962. White served for more than 31 years; only eight
justices have held longer tenures. He served with 20 justices, including
three chief justices. During his career he wrote 1275 opinions: 495 opin-
ions of the Court, 249 concurring opinions, and 572 dissents, including
218 dissenting from denials of petitions for certiorari. Imposing as they
are, numbers are hardly the measure of the man, nor does the remark-
able curriculum vitae capture either his character or his contribution
to the nation.
   “Those of us who argued before him, representing all shades of opin-
ion at the Bar, respected his impeccable preparation and acute interro-
gations. We realized that oral argument was not simply a tribute that
tradition paid to due process but, at least for him, a means for clarify-

ing his understanding of the case in all of its ramifications. Many of us
feared his questions far more than the arguments of our adversaries.
He quickly could call on his deep experience at the Bar and on the
Bench to focus an argument or to expose an artful diversion. He cut to
the heart of a case, but also sharply identified the consequences of a
theory that was more convenient than durable. Charles Fried, who
served as Solicitor General from 1985 to 1989, has written, ‘[I]t is not
possible to have seen Justice White in the courtroom, to have argued
before him, without getting a sense of a strong intelligence. He knew
the case. He had worked out the intricacies . . . . He delighted in asking
just the question that displayed a weakness the advocate was trying
to skate over, or perhaps had not even noticed. “Skewer” is the word
that comes to mind.’
   “Lawyers who refused to come face to face with what he viewed to
be the pivotal issue in a case could be met with a withering stare or
abrupt dismissal. Yet his questioning was never cruel or punitive. He
expected the best presentation from the best advocates, and he mani-
fested compassion for those who had been propelled by their cases from
run-of-the-mine practice in local courts to the unfamiliar terrain of the
highest court in the country. Some of us in this room recall the young
advocate in her first, perhaps only, appearance here in which she ner-
vously read a prepared argument. Interrupted from the Bench with
the comment that the Court had a ‘rule which frowned on reading
oral arguments,’ Justice White gently intervened with the reassuring
observation that the ‘Solicitor General does it all the time.’
   “Justice Powell acknowledged what could appear to be impatience in
Justice White’s demeanor on the bench: ‘If he did not like a lawyer’s
argument, he often would swivel his chair around and would appear to
lose interest in the argument. His recollection of detail, however, al-
ways made clear that he had been attentive, as he would remember
specifics that other Justices overlooked.’ Those of us who have seen
the back of Justice White’s chair can take some comfort in that revela-
tion, and it points to a substantial contribution that the justice made
to the institution that we would not otherwise know. As The Chief
Justice has borne witness: ‘Those of us who daily served with him
likely have a greater appreciation for his contributions than can be
obtained by simply reading his opinions or tallying his votes in cases
decided during his tenure. Given the force of his powerful intellect,
his breadth of experience, and his institutional memory, Justice White
consistently played a major role in the Court’s discussion of cases at
its weekly conferences. His comments there reflected not only his me-

358                     MONDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 2002

ticulous preparation and rigorous understanding of the Court prece-
dent bearing on the question, but also pithily expressed his sense of
the practical effect of a given decision.’
   “Whatever his influence in the conference room, it is by his opinions
that he inevitably is most widely known and will be most remembered.
The corpus of his work does not represent the exegesis of a theory or
the creation of a jurisprudential monument. In the words of The Chief
Justice, there is ‘no Byron R. White School of Jurisprudence.’ At his
confirmation hearings, when he was asked to define the constitutional
role of the Supreme Court, he replied simply: ‘To decide cases.’ For
some, the response was a cryptic truism, but to those who watched and
read his work over three decades, the statement was a credo. From
beginning to end, he saw the appropriate limits of his position more
readily than its dramatic possibilities. He knew well that particular
historical contingencies had placed him on the Court and that the insti-
tution was bigger than he. ‘We are a very small number for the freight
we carry,’ he was fond of saying. His job, as he saw it, was to resolve
disputes: to read the briefs, to question lawyers rigorously, to find the
flaws in the general statements about the law, and to see, as far as
humanly possible, the consequences of each decision and its supporting
rationales. ‘My guess,’ Charles Fried has written, ‘is that he came
closer than most justices to trying to make sense out of each case, one
at a time.’
   “Justice White’s keen intelligence was largely focused on predicting,
skeptically, the consequences for other applications of the rule, and the
real-world effects of a Supreme Court judgment. The habit of mind
that invoked constant questioning and probing could, and did, produce
reconsideration in the light of changes in other doctrinal areas or in the
development of the law that vexes judges most, the law of unintended
consequences. Although no member of the Court during his tenure was
more committed to the doctrine of stare decisis, even with respect to
decisions with which he initially disagreed—sometimes vehemently—
Justice White never felt boxed into a precedential corner, even by his
own opinions. ‘Doctrinal consistency just did not weigh heavily with
him if it led to a conclusion that did not make sense,’ Charles Fried
has written. ‘With no other justice would you get so little mileage from
quoting his own words back to him.’
   “When the dots of more than a thousand opinions are connected,
patterns, remarkably free of ideological shading, unmistakably emerge.
Two themes stand out in bold clarity: respect for the scope of Congres-
sional power and skepticism over judicial creation of novel constitu-

tional rights. Perhaps no justice in the second half of the twentieth
century was more committed to a generous understanding of Article I
than Justice White. Whether construing Congress’s power under the
Commerce Clause or measuring the scope of remedial power under the
post-Civil War amendments to the Constitution, Justice White ac-
knowledged what he viewed to be the necessary latitude owed to Con-
gress to exercise power under a ‘constitution intended to endure for
ages to come, and consequently adapted to the various crises of human
affairs.’2 Late in his career, he wrote that ‘The Constitution is not a
deed setting forth the precise metes and bounds of its subject matter;
rather, it is a document announcing fundamental principles in value-
laden terms that leave ample scope for the exercise of normative judg-
ment by those charged with interpreting and applying it.’3 The lesson,
in his view, was one not only for the courts but also for the other
branches of government enjoying constitutional power and obligations.
   “Justice White’s views achieved their most powerful and passionate
expression in the constitutional domain of separation of powers. When
Congress attempted to develop new mechanisms for controlling admin-
istrative agencies that it had created, Justice White objected strenu-
ously when the Court was unable to square the innovations with the
metes and bounds of Article I.4 He argued powerfully in the Northern
Pipeline case that ‘at this point in the history of constitutional law’
the Court should not have ‘look[ed] only to the constitutional text’ to
determine Congress’ power ‘to create adjudicative institutions de-
signed to carry out federal policy.” 5 A year later, he defended the legis-
lative veto as an ‘indispensable political invention that . . . assures
the accountability of independent regulatory agencies, and preserves
Congress’ power over lawmaking.’6 In these and other cases, he empha-
sized that the constitutional text could not be understood intelligently
without regard to its own historical development and to a practical
appreciation of the machinery of government created and developed
under its authority. Whether based in the Necessary and Proper Clause
or in the expansive view of congressional capacity recognized from the

earliest days of the nation, new schemes of governing were no less
legitimate or constitutionally inappropriate to Justice White than the
mechanisms that had been bitterly contested but ultimately ratified
under the New Deal.
   “Justice White took a capacious view of the Supreme Court’s juris-
diction over state court decisions, and he was the leading authority on
the scope of the Voting Rights Act, to which he applied a broad reading
in service of access by minorities to the electoral process. Where Con-
gress spoke clearly and within the canonical scope of its historic pow-
ers, his opinions provided muscular support for upholding Congress’
actions. ‘Judges have an exaggerated view of their role in our polity,’
Justice White has been quoted as saying. That is not to say that he
was reluctant to exercise what he viewed to be his responsibility or
that he doubted the capacity of courts to develop doctrine interstitially,
as Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., famously said.7 But Justice White
was dubious at best when the courts were invited to create novel con-
stitutional rights under the rubric of the Due Process Clauses. He did
not subscribe to a formula packaged as ‘a living constitution,’ ‘original
intent,’ ‘plain meaning,’ or some other catechism: ‘[The liberty guaran-
teed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment] is not
a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of prop-
erty; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the right to keep and
bear arms; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures; and
so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a
freedom from all substantial arbitrary imposition and purposeless re-
straints.’8 The continuum was not open-ended, however, and was re-
strained in his view by the constitutional architecture that places pri-
macy in democratically accountable bodies and correspondingly assigns
a subsidiary role to courts: ‘That the Court has ample precedent for
the creation of new constitutional rights should not lead it to repeat
that process at will. The Judiciary, including this Court, is the most
vulnerable and comes nearest to illegitimacy when it deals with judge-
made constitutional law having little or no cognizable roots in the lan-
guage or even the design of the Constitution . . . . [T]he Court should
be extremely reluctant to breathe still further substantive content into
the Due Process Clause so as to strike down legislation adopted by a
State or city to promote its welfare. Whenever the judiciary does so, it

unavoidably pre-empts for itself another part of the governance of the
country without express constitutional authority.’9
   “Justice White’s conception of his role was almost intuitive, bred in
the bone rather than created or fully asserted. He believed in law, both
as an authoritative expression of the social will through the legitimate
organs of government and as central to the vitality of a free society.
Unlike many in his era, he did not view the courts as first among equals
in law-making: those directly responsible to the electorate, be they
town councils or legislatures, bore the first burden and the ultimate
responsibility for mediating the often conflicting desires of a commu-
nity. Accordingly, the first obligation of courts was to facilitate those
judgments and not to question them as a matter of habit, sentiment,
or impulse. And in an age when cynicism toward government became
endemic, Justice White believed in the good faith of police officers,
school boards, local officials, juries, and administrators charged with a
public trust. ‘To be sure,’ as Kate Stith-Cabranes has written, ‘the
assumption was rebuttable; the confidence could be broken. But he
never expected (or demanded) perfection, for he well understood that
neither human beings nor any institutions they create can be flawless.’
Public officials, without exception, were accountable under law for
transgressions, but they were allowed a practical discretion to perform
their civic duties.
   “Now is neither the place nor the time for a comprehensive catalog
or assessment of Justice White’s specific contributions to the various
fields that fall within the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction. Suffice to say
that he had a profound impact in a number of areas other than those
already mentioned, including jurisdiction, criminal procedure, proce-
dural due process, the First Amendment, labor law, antitrust, and fed-
eral pre-emption. From his earliest days on the Court, he also made
himself expert in fields that were alien to his colleagues or with which
they enjoyed little direct experience, such as water rights, Native
American sovereignty, and boundary disputes. He was, in private life
and in public service, a team player who incessantly sought opportuni-
ties to contribute to the institutions and enterprises to which he
attached himself. He esteemed public service as a lawyer’s highest call-
ing and warmly encouraged clerks, students, and friends to contribute
their talents and energies to the common good.
   “When he announced his retirement March 19, 1993, effective at the
end of term, he was in many respects at the height of his powers and
enjoying good health. He could have continued to serve for several

more years. When suggestions were made that he might be planning
to stay on the Court long enough to establish the record as the longest-
sitting justice, many of us suspected that his decision to retire might
be accelerated so that no hint of vanity could cloud his continued serv-
ice. Justice White was committed to both the integrity and the dignity
of the Supreme Court and fastidiously avoided what he viewed as even
the smallest potential blemish on the institution. Life-long friends mar-
veled, for example, that he declined offers of lifts from airport to fish-
ing camp, for fear that he could later be accused of accepting gratuities
from potential litigants, even when the ‘potential litigants’ were fully
retired and disengaged from their businesses. In a statement released
on the day Justice White announced his retirement, he said in part: ‘It
has been an interesting and exciting experience to serve on the Court.
But after 31 years, Marion and I think that someone else should be
permitted to have a like experience.’ No other member of the Court
had ever mentioned a family member in making a retirement announce-
ment, and the inclusion of Marion White was both deliberate and heart-
felt. For a half-century, they were a devoted and energetic partnership,
whether raising a family, traveling to circuit conferences and law school
moot courts, or fly-fishing in their beloved Rockies. Both were deeply
rooted in the rocky soil of the Colorado front range, and they treated
both Washington and Denver as home. Neither distance nor time ever
separated them from the intimacy of life-long friendships or family
ties, especially with their children, Charles Byron (Barney) White and
Nancy White Lippe, and six grandchildren, who remember him as
‘Grandpa Justice.’ Travels to public events were the only glimpses that
the public enjoyed of what was otherwise an intensely private couple,
aside from the odd sighting at a Kennedy Center or Wolf Trap concert
or in the galleries of the art museums, especially the Phillips Collection
and the National Gallery, that they both loved so well.
   “Justice White treasured his private life and guarded it with what to
some was breathtaking verve. As a young man, he had been catapulted
uncomfortably into the public eye primarily because of his athletic
prowess. That experience, plus innate modesty and shyness, made him
allergic to the transparent celebrity that became the norm for public
figures during his times in government. Few public figures in recent
memory have cared so little about their popularity or even the judg-
ment of history. Service, for him, was its own reward. Justice White
remained secure in the values that were forged early in life on the
lonely high plains and confirmed as a young professional: He measured
himself by his own extraordinary standards, filled each ‘unforgiving

minute with sixty seconds worth of distance run,’ and was satisfied
that ultimate judgment lay beyond temporal realms. To those who
were fortunate enough to penetrate the wall of separation between
public and private, he was, in the words of someone who knew him for
most of his life, ‘remarkably tender and instinctively generous but nei-
ther wished to acknowledge it or have it recognized.’ No account of the
man is complete without acknowledging the countless acts of kindness
and quiet compassion that touched so many, especially during times of
personal crises, but were, by instinct and design, seen by so few.
   “We are assembled not to compromise a jealously guarded privacy
but to celebrate a life dedicated to public service and the highest stand-
ards of integrity and performance. Those of us who knew him have not
yet entirely reconciled our loss. We miss his generous sympathy and
broad comprehension of the world, his indefatigable curiosity, his
warmth, his wickedly dry sense of humor, and, for some of us lucky
enough to know him well, his crushing handshake, which focused his
strength, friendship, and intensity into one bracing moment. We are
comforted with the thought that death takes a man but does not fully
extinguish a life, that he lives on in his family, in his vast legion of
close friends, in others whom he touched, and in everyone for whom he
was a courageous public servant who never flinched when the stakes
were the greatest.
   “WHEREFORE, IT IS RESOLVED, that we, the Bar of the Su-
preme Court of the United States, express our deep sense of loss upon
the death of Justice Byron R. White, that we acknowledge our profes-
sional debt to him for his decades of extraordinary public service, and
that we gratefully acknowledge his contributions to our profession, to
the law, to the Court and to the nation; it is further
   “RESOLVED, that the Chairmen of our Committee on Resolutions
be directed to present these resolutions to the Court with the prayer
that they be embodied in its permanent records.” Respectfully submit-

   The Chief Justice said:
   “Thank you General Olson. The Court recognizes the Attorney Gen-
eral of the United States.”
   Attorney General Ashcroft addressed the Court as follows:
   “Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
   “The Bar of the Court met today in honor of the memory of Byron
R. White, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, Associate Justice
from 1962 to 1993.
   “Byron White exemplified what President Kennedy described as,
‘the new generation of Americans,’ called to public service in the
1960s–a generation, according to President Kennedy, ‘born in this cen-
tury, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, and
proud of our ancient heritage.’
   “The son of parents who had not graduated from high school, Byron
White grew up in the small town of Wellington, Colorado. As he put
it, ‘in Wellington we were all quite poor, although we didn’t necessarily
JNL02$1118—07-24-03 17:03:19     JOURNAPGT          MILES




                        MONDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 2002                    365
feel poor.’ He learned early the value of hard work, discipline, and
sacrifice, toiling in the sugar beet fields from the time he could wield a
hoe. He earned the grades to qualify for a full academic scholarship to
the University of Colorado. There, Byron White excelled as a scholar,
athlete, as a leader. Upon graduation, he faced the choice of studying
at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar or playing in the National Football
League. He found a way to do both.
   “At the outset of World War II, Byron White interrupted his studies
at Yale Law School to join the United States Navy. He served with
distinction in Naval intelligence in the Pacific, displaying courage,
strength, selflessness under fire, and earning a Bronze Star.
   “Byron White returned from the War to complete his legal education
and to marry Marion Stearns, who would become his lifelong compan-
ion, confidante, as well as the mother of their children, Barney and
Nancy.
   “Byron White originally came to this Court in September of 1946 as
a law clerk to Chief Justice Vinson. He was the first law clerk who
would later return as Justice.
   “After that clerkship year, Byron and Marion went home to their
beloved Colorado. For a decade and a half, he engaged in the private
practice of law, gaining broad legal experience and honing good judg-
ment that would inform his future work.
   “In 1961, President Kennedy called Byron White back to Washington
to become the Deputy Attorney General, the number two position in
the Justice Department. The first year of the Kennedy Administration
presented unanticipated challenges. Among them was the effort of the
Freedom Riders to integrate public buses and terminals in the South—
an effort that was met with widespread violence and threats of vio-
lence. Deputy Attorney General White served as the Administration’s
point man on the scene, directing the activities of several hundred fed-
eral marshals dispatched to restore order.
   “In the spring of 1962, after only fourteen months at the Justice
Department, Byron White was selected for another post: Associate Jus-
tice of this Court. At his confirmation hearing, he explained his view
of the role of the judiciary in our democratic system. I quote him now,
he says ‘[I]t is clear under the Constitution that legislative power is
not vested in the Supreme Court, it is vested in the Congress; and
I feel the major instrument for changing the laws of this country is
the Congress.’
   “Those words reflected a philosophy of government that would guide
Justice White throughout his three decades on the bench. He had con-
JNL02$1118—07-24-03 17:03:19      JOURNAPGT          MILES

siderable faith in the ability of government–especially the national gov-
ernment–to address the social and economic problems of our times. He
believed, however, that doing so was principally the responsibility of
the elected branches, not the courts.
   “Justice White advocated a broad understanding of Congress’s pow-
ers under Article I, not only to provide a national response to emerging
concerns such as race discrimination and environmental pollution, but
also to adjust the mechanisms of government itself.
   “At the same time, Justice White cautioned against the Court’s rec-
ognition of new private rights and new public obligations as a matter
of constitutional law. ‘The Judiciary is the most vulnerable and comes
nearest to illegitimacy when it deals with judge-made constitutional
law having little or no cognizable roots in the language or even the
design of the Constitution.’ He went on to say, ‘Whenever the Judiciary
does so, it unavoidably pre-empts for itself another part of the gover-
nance of the country without express constitutional authority.’
   “In such circumstances, Justice White believed that the resolution of
sensitive social issues should be left, for the most part, ‘with the people
and to the political processes the people have devised to govern their
affairs.’ Indeed, he pointed out in his first dissenting opinion that the
courts ‘cannot match either the states or Congress in expert under-
standing’ of such issues. As one knowledgeable observer has written,
‘Perhaps no one who has ever sat on the Court has been more consist-
ently aware that he was one participant in a large scheme for govern-
ing 250 million people, and that others–in Congress, in the executive
branch, in state and local governments, on school boards, in police de-
partments, and in important positions in the private sector–must act
and decide as well.’
   “Justice White coupled his confidence in democratic institutions with
his insistence that all citizens be afforded the opportunity to participate
fully and effectively in the democratic process. He joined opinions es-
tablishing the ‘one person-one vote’ principle with respect to legislative
apportionment, and he wrote opinions extending that principle to units
of local government. He urged an expansive application of the Voting
Rights Act in order to provide minorities with equal opportunity to
share in the political life of the nation.
   “Justice White influenced the development of civil-rights law in other
respects as well. He was the author of the Court’s landmark opinion in
Washington v. Davis, which established discriminatory intent, not ef-
fect, as the standard for Fourteenth Amendment violations. In apply-
ing that standard, however, he made clear that such intent may be

                       MONDAY, NOVEMBER 18, 2002                   367
discerned in a variety of ways, including by impact of the challenged
action on a minority group. In addition, even where the claim of dis-
crimination was made by persons not in a protected class such as race,
he insisted that the distinctions drawn by a law be, in fact, based on
reason.
   “Justice White wrote frequently, both for the Court and in dissent,
in the field of criminal procedure. He cautioned against rigid judge-
made rules that could impede unduly the search for truth in the crimi-
nal justice system, and he urged that considerations of ‘reasonableness’
and ‘good faith’ guide the application of the Fourth Amendment. He
wrote the Court’s opinion in United States v. Leon, which declined to
apply the exclusionary rule to evidence obtained by law-enforcement
officers in good-faith reliance on a search warrant that was ultimately
found not to be supported by probable cause.
   “Justice White made many other contributions to the law during his
tenure on the Court, including in the areas of federal jurisdiction, the
First Amendment, and the application of the federal labor, securities,
and antitrust laws. But his contributions to the nation, to the Court,
and to the law extend beyond the pages of the United States Reports.
Those contributions include the personal modesty of a man who, as
President Kennedy put it, ‘excelled in everything he attempted.’ They
include the high standards of integrity, intellectual rigor, and hard
work that Justice White demanded of himself and others. And they
include the commitment to public service that Justice White continues,
by his example, to instill in those who knew him and the many others
who strive to emulate him.
   “Mr. Chief Justice, on behalf of the lawyers of this nation and, in
particular, of the Bar of this Court, I request respectfully that the
resolutions presented to you in honor and celebration of the memory
of Justice Byron R. White be accepted by the Court, and that they,
together with the chronicle of these proceedings, be ordered kept for
all time in the records of this Court.”
   The Chief Justice said:
   “Thank you, Attorney General Ashcroft, and thank you, General
Olson, for your presentations in memory of our late colleague and
friend, Justice Byron White. Your motion that they be made part of
the permanent record of the Court is granted.
   “We also extend to Co-Chairmen Lance Liebman and Dennis J.
Hutchinson and the members of the Committee on Resolutions, Chair-
man Robert Barnett and members of the Arrangements Committee,

and Larry L. Simms, Chairman of today’s meeting of the Bar, our ap-
preciation for the Resolutions you have read today.
   “Byron White was nominated to the Court by President Kennedy in
April 1962, was confirmed by the Senate eight days later. He was the
93rd Justice to serve on this Court and the first to have previously
served as a Supreme Court law clerk.
   “During his 31 years as an Associate Justice, he wrote more than
450 majority opinions for the Court. One cannot in these brief remarks
describe the breadth of important decisions written by Byron White,
but looking, just for example, at some of his opinions on the First
Amendment’s guarantee of freedom of speech and of the press gives
you an idea of his legacy. In 1969, he wrote the majority decision in
Red Lion Broadcasting Co., holding that the Federal Communications
Commission regulations implementing the ‘fairness doctrine’ did not
violate the First Amendment. In Branzburg v. Hayes, decided in 1972,
he wrote the opinion holding that the First Amendment did not afford
journalists a testimonial privilege against appearing before a grand
jury to answer questions relevant to criminal investigations. And in
1979, he wrote for the Court in Herbert v. Lando that the First Amend-
ment did not bar the plaintiff in an action for defamation from inquiring
into the editorial process and the publisher’s state of mind to prove
actual malice. Three years later, in New York v. Ferber, he wrote the
opinion for the Court holding that child pornography—even though it
is not obscene—is not entitled to First Amendment protection. From
these opinions you will see that, as members of the Court go, he was
not moved to rapture by the mere mention of the words ‘First Amend-
ment.’ I obviously mean no disparagement by this comment, since I
voted with him in each of the three cases which I mentioned when I
was on the Court.
   “Of course, reviewing his opinions does not convey the measure of
Byron White’s contributions to the Court and the law. Suffice it to say
that he was a tremendously influential member of this Court during
the entire period of his lengthy service on it. Those of us who served
with him probably have the best understanding of his contributions to
the work of the Court.
   “He was always a major contributor to the Court’s discussion of the
argued cases at its weekly conference, a discussion which is absolutely
essential to the writing of the opinion of the Court in the case. His
observations during those discussions reflected not only an understand-
ing of the Court’s previous decisions that bore on the question, but

pithily expressed his view as to what the practical effect of a particular
decision would be.
  “Justice White was a rare combination of brilliant scholar and gifted
athlete. He was an able colleague and a good friend. He came as close
as any of us to meriting Matthew Arnold’s encomium: he ‘saw life
steadily and he saw it whole.’ ”
