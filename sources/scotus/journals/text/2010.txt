SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

   Present: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, Jus­
tice Thomas, Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, Justice Alito, Justice
Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan.

                      Order in Pending Case
   No. 10A393. Michael Bowersox, Applicant v. Roderick Nunley. Ap­
plication to vacate the stay of execution of sentence of death entered
by the United States District Court for the Western District of Mis­
souri on October 18, 2010, presented to Justice Alito and by him re­
ferred to the Court denied. Justice Scalia would grant the application
to vacate the stay of execution.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

   Present: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, Jus­
tice Thomas, Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, Justice Alito, Justice
Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan.

                       Order in Pending Case
  No. 10A362. Respect Maine PAC, et al., Applicants v. Walter F.
McKee, et al. Application for an injunction, presented to Justice Ken­
nedy and by him referred to the Court denied. Applicants are correct
to note that relief was granted in McComish v. Bennett, 560 U. S. –––
(2010), which concerned a constitutional challenge to an Arizona law
similar to the Maine law challenged by applicants here. The McComish
applicants, however, requested a stay of an appeals court decision,
whereas applicants here are asking for an injunction against enforce­
ment of a presumptively constitutional state legislative act. Such a re­
quest “demamds a signiﬁcantly higher justiﬁcation” than a request for
a stay, because unlike a stay, an injunction “does not simply suspend
judicial alteration of the status quo but grants judicial intervention
that has been withheld by lower courts.” Ohio Citizens for Responsible
Energy, Inc. v. NRC, 479 U. S. 1312, 1313 (1986) (Scalia, J., in cham­
bers). In light of these considerations, and given the difﬁculties in fash­
ioning relief so close to the election, applicants’ request for extraordi­
nary relief is denied. Justice Scalia and Justice Alito would grant the
application for an injunction as to the matching fund provisions.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

   Present: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, Jus­
tice Thomas, Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, Justice Alito, Justice
Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan.

                       Order in Pending Case
  No. 10A416. Janice K. Brewer, Governor of Arizona, et al., Appli­
cants v. Jeffrey Timothy Landrigan. Application to vacate the order by
the district court granting a temporary restraining order, presented to
Justice Kennedy and by him referred to the Court granted. There is
no evidence in the record to suggest that the drug obtained from a
foreign source is unsafe. The district court granted the restraining
order because it was left to speculate as to the risk of harm. See Order
Granting Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order in Landrigan v.
Brewer, No. CV–10–02246–PHX–ROS (D Ariz.), Doc. 21, p. 15 (“[T]he
Court is left to speculate . . . whether the non-FDA approved drug
will cause pain and suffering.”). But speculation cannot substitute for
evidence that the use of the drug is “ ‘sure or very likely to cause
serious illness and needless suffering.’ ” Baze v. Rees, 553 U. S. 35, 50
(2008) (quoting Helling v. McKinney, 509 U. S. 25, 33, (1993)). There
was no showing that the drug was unlawfully obtained, nor was there
an offer of proof to that effect. Motion to ﬁle documents under seal
denied as moot. Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, Justice Sotomayor,
and Justice Kagan would deny the application to vacate the order
granting a temporary restraining order.

2010 Term of the Court will be adjourned and the October 2011 Term
of the Court will begin as provided by law.”
   “The Court also notes today that the Court’s Librarian, Judith Gas­
kell, has announced her retirement. She will be leaving us before we
reconvene in the fall. Ms. Gaskell has served as the Court’s Librarian
since 2003. In the earliest years, the Court did not have its own Li­
brary. Members of the Court used their own personal collections or
borrowed books from the Library of Congress or other sources. Today,
the Librarian manages the Court’s splendid collection of more than
500,000 volumes, directs a staff of 28, and provides irreplaceable re­
search in support of our work. The Court thanks you, Ms. Gaskell, for
your dedicated service, and we wish you well in your retirement.”
   “On behalf of the Court, I would like to thank the Supreme Court
employees for their outstanding work and dedication to their important
responsibilities during this Term. The commitment and professionalism
of all the Court staff contribute signiﬁcantly to the accomplishment of
the Court’s mission.”
   “The Court also thanks the members of the Supreme Court’s Bar for
their professionalism and the discharge of their responsibilities as ofﬁ­
cers of the Court.”


  Adjourned until Monday, October 3, 2011, at 10 o’clock.
