The Chief Justice said:
"Last Wednesday, Marjorie Leonard Brennan, wife of Justice Bren-
nan, died, after a long and courageous struggle with illness. What
marked her in a very special way that all who knew her admired, was
her shining spirit and uncomplaining attitude. No one can really know
what that kind of courage, in the face of long illness, calls for, but
she inspired the love and admiration of all who knew her. Especially
those of us who saw her frequently, marvelled at her courage and
cheerfulness.
The light of her spirit will be sorely missed, not only by her family,
but all those who, over the years, witnessed her quiet strength, her
smile, her determination to carry on with life and live it to its fullest.
Marjorie Brennan truly lived her life to the fullest against great odds.
As a mark of our sorrow, and of our affection for her, and for our
Brother Justice Brennan and his family, and our deep and lasting affec-
tion for Marjorie Brennan, the Journal of the Court will record that ad-
journment of this Court today is in honor of her life, and her memory."

MONDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1982
The Chief Justice said:
277
"The Court is in special session this afternoon to receive the resolu-
tions of the Bar of the Supreme Court in tribute to our former colleague
and friend, the late Justice Fortas.
The Solicitor General is recognized at this time for the purpose
of presenting those resolutions which were adopted by the Bar. Mr.
Solicitor General."
Mr. Solicitor General Lee addressed the Court as follows:
"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
RESOLUTIONS
The members of the Bar of the Court met this day and have adopted
resolutions in honor of Justice Fortas. And I would ask leave of the
Court to present those resolutions at this time.
Abe Fortas, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United
States from 1965 to 1969, died at his home in Washington, D.C., on
April 5, 1982. He was 71 years old, but even for a man whose career had
been so rich, so varied, and so fruitful, his death cannot be said to have
come in the fullness of time. Only a few days before, he had argued be-
fore the Court and neither his appetite for work nor his powers showed
any signs of diminishing. The members of the Bar have met in the
Supreme Court building on December 13, 1982, to commemorate him as
one of the great figures of our profession, to survey his vast and diverse
accomplishments, and to testify to the enrichment he brought to the
law, to the arts, and to the nation. To recall the details of his life is to
exhibit, as the historian Burckhardt said, only the "underside of the
tapestry": the knots and stitches, not the whole work. Abe Fortas was
animated by a warmth, a compassion, a profound gravity that could be
felt, that cannot be captured in words, but that made him who he was
and whom we remember.
Abe Fortas was born in Memphis, Tennessee, on June 19, 1910. His
Orthodox Jewish parents had emigrated from England. His father was
a cabinetmaker who was also a sometime shopkeeper and jeweler. Abe
was the youngest of five children and the family's modest circumstances
dictated that any achievement he enjoyed would be self-made. He
worked his way through high school by playing the violin in a small
dance band. The violin began as a source of pleasure, became a means of
self-support (along with part-time work in a shoe store), and remained a
passion throughout his life. His academic record led to a scholarship at
Southwestern College, a Presbyterian institution in Memphis. There he
was president of the drama and debating clubs and leader of the school
orchestra. With a near-perfect academic record, he won the Peres

278
MONDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1982
Scholarship to the Yale Law School, which he entered in 1930 at the age
of twenty.
Propitious circumstances and the relentless application of his remark-
able ability made Yale the turning point of Fortas' life. He led his class
academically, was Editor in Chief of the Law Journal, and authored a
brilliant student note at the direction of William O. Douglas, then a
young Sterling Professor of Law who would later call Fortas "my prize
student" and who would be an intimate friend for life. Fortas was ap-
pointed assistant professor of law upon his graduation in 1933, but for
the next four years his world had two centers, New Haven and Wash-
ington. During summers and semesters when he was not teaching he
worked at the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, at the behest
of two other Yale faculty members who had been drawn to the New
Deal, Thurman Arnold and Wesley Sturges. In 1934, Fortas joined
Douglas at the new Securities and Exchange Commission as a consult-
ant. He became an important collaborator with Douglas in the prepara-
tion of a study of protective committees that led to major legislative
revisions in reorganization proceedings under the Bankruptcy Act.
Three years after joining the Commission, Fortas left the Yale faculty.
In the meantime he had married Carolyn Agger. She, too, became a
brilliant student at the Yale Law School and after her graduation in
1938 began the outstanding career as a tax lawyer that has continued to
the present day.
In 1939, at the age of twenty-nine, Fortas became General Counsel to
the Bituminous Coal Division in the Department of the Interior. Two
years later he became Director of the Division of Power in the Depart-
ment. In that capacity he met a young Congressman named Lyndon B.
Johnson who was interested in a proposed power project in his home
state of Texas. The introduction led to a life-long friendship, which in-
cluded Fortas' representation of Johnson in the contested Texas Sena-
torial election of 1948 and in other less public matters.
Talented young men, of whom Fortas was one of the best, were able
to rise quickly in the New Deal. In 1942, at the age of thirty-two, For-
tas became Under Secretary of the Interior. His legal abilities had been
firmly established. In the new post he demonstrated the judgment and
force required to become a successful second in command to Secretary
Harold Ickes, the self-styled curmudgeon of the Roosevelt administra-
tion. Fortas won Ickes' trust so quickly and to such a degree that he
frequently substituted for the Secretary at Cabinet meetings.
With the declaration of war after Pearl Harbor, the business of the
Interior Department acquired new gravity. The Department was

MONDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1982
279
charged with administering the removal of Japanese-Americans from
the West Coast and with overseeing the administration of martial law
in the Hawaiian Territory. Fortas fought a determined, though unsuc-
cessful, battle to prevent the relocation and internment of the Japa-
nese-Americans. In later years he would tell associates that he was
prouder of his efforts in that cause than in any other he undertook in
more than a decade of government service. With Ickes, he also fought
to ameliorate the harshest aspects of martial law in Hawaii during the
War.
Fortas' tenure in the Interior Department was interrupted briefly
when he resigned to enlist as an apprentice seaman in the Navy. Re-
jecting any high-level desk assignment in the service, he was in boot.
camp when a persistent serious eye ailment compelled his release and
he was reappointed to his still-vacant post as Under Secretary.
When the War ended, so did the New Deal. In January 1946, the law
firm of Arnold and Fortas was organized in Washington, D.C. Its pur-
pose as Fortas later recalled in a tribute to Thurman Arnold, "was to
provide a means for its two partners to make a living." For almost
twenty years, Fortas managed the firm and built it into one of the lead-
ing institutions in the city and in the country.
The firm was extraordinarily successful in satisfying the purposes of
its founders, who later included Paul Porter, former Price Adminis-
trator during the War. But Arnold, Fortas & Porter was more than a
lucrative practice meeting the needs of large corporate clients. During
the period of the 1950s that Justice Douglas called the time of the
"Black Silence of Fear," the firm represented not only large companies
but also private citizens who were victims of anti-Communist hysteria,
such as Dorothy Bailey, Dr. John Peters, Owen Lattimore, and Dr. Ed-
ward Condon, Director of the National Bureau of Standards. The cases
all involved the fundamental right of individuals to differ from ortho-
doxy and to join, or at least to associate freely, with others of similar
views. The issues on which the firm based its defense of such cases
were drier and more legalistic. "Most of them," Fortas later wrote, “in-
volved fundamental questions of procedural rights: to specific charges,
to confrontation and cross-examination, to judgments based solely on
substantial evidence, to the presentation of a defense and to counsel."
Each victory was one of both substance and process.
The mere fact that the firm would take an unpopular case was a re-
pudiation of the orthodoxy that had swept the country during the pe-
riod. But Fortas and his colleagues did not rest on symbolism. Each
case, be the client Lever Brothers, Federated Department Stores or

280
MONDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1982
Ezra Pound, received the same meticulous care. In every case in which
he was involved, Fortas was at once the manager and the master of the
smallest detail. The temperament of the named partners in the firm
was illustrated by Thurman Arnold's description of how each would
have handled a trial involving the United Fruit Company. "I would try
it carload by carload, Paul would try it case by case, and Abe would try
it banana by banana."
Mastery of detail requires time, and in addition to his remarkable
intellectual ability Fortas had enormous stamina. From his earliest
days in the New Deal, law was a fourteen-hour a day, six or seven-day
a week task. To junior colleagues he could be a humorless, somewhat
distant perfectionist: no early draft of any document was ever quite sat-
isfactory. Final approval was only achieved after the most exacting pro-
fessional standards had been satisfied.
Although Abe Fortas was identified with "causes," he did not see the
lawyer's duty as service to a cause. The only duty was to the client, and
not to the client's wishes but to the client's interests. In praising
Thurman Arnold, Fortas obviously articulated a mutual view and his
own credo in rejecting a new vogue: "As the young lawyer views many
of today's battles, the client is of relatively little importance. The cause,
not the client, is the object of dedication. The client is a technical neces-
sity, not a person whose life or welfare is at stake. The undertaking is
shaped and prosecuted not in defense or vindication of the client, but in
maximum furtherance of the idea or program." As he rejected repre-
senting causes instead of-and perhaps at the expense of-people, For-
tas also refused to pass judgment on the relative moral worth of his cli-
ents. The function and responsibility of the lawyer was to serve and to
represent "each client as an individual, whether the client was a corpo-
rate malefactor or a presumably saintly civil libertarian."
Two of Fortas' most important victories were for clients who fell
somewhere between the poles he thus identified. His representation of
Monte Durham in 1954, by appointment of the United States Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, led to a decision that for
its time was a landmark in the modern attempt to bring into closer
proximity legal rules and scientific knowledge concerning insanity.
Less than a decade later, again by appointment of the court, he con-
vinced the Supreme Court that Clarence Earl Gideon was entitled
under the Constitution to a lawyer to defend him in state court for a
petty offense. Both cases were constitutional watersheds.
Abe Fortas was an advocate of not only the powerful and the penni-
less, but also of the arts. If his passion professionally was craftsman-

MONDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1982
281
ship, his passion privately was music and art. The two merged symboli-
cally, in the form of his desk at the firm, which was made from a
Victorian grand piano. He was an effective supporter of the National
Endowments for the Arts and for the Humanities. He arranged for
Pablo Casals to play at the White House, and in later years he helped
direct the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. He once
said that the only thing he could not live without was his music. Though
he played for pleasure, his musical sense and skill were of a high order,
and he played the violin and viola regularly with the talented profes-
sionals who were his friends, in the Sunday evening sessions at his
home that he called The 3025 N Street Strictly No Refund Quartet. His
violin was a 200-year-old Guidantus, the gift of violinist Isaac Stern,
cellist Leonard Rose, and pianist Eugene Istomin. A month after For-
tas' death, Stern led a memorial concert at the Kennedy Center in
memory of the man who worked to make the Kennedy Center a vital
force in the arts, who with Stern successfully fought the destruction of
Carnegie Hall, and who helped make the Hirshhorn Museum a reality.
Abe Fortas was a man of rare completeness-patron and practitioner
of the arts, successful corporate lawyer and superb advocate, defender
of the poor and the persecuted. His legal renown came as a "Washing-
ton lawyer," but not of the breed sometimes thought to provide clients
with influence more than advice. Fortas knew Washington from the in-
side, but his success rested on an intuitive knowledge, built from the
ground up, of how bureaucracies worked and thus how they needed to
be addressed. His grasp of the workings of government extended to
both the recondite and the mundane details. When an elevator car car-
rying lawyers, judges, and administrators was trapped between floors
in the Export-Import Bank on the way to a meeting, Fortas opened the
operator's panel, pulled a lever, flicked a switch or two and the car was
once again on its way. When his fellow passengers expressed their
astonishment, Fortas replied with the mock innocence he occasionally
affected, "It's really quite simple, for an insider."
Fortas made fun of his personal connections in other ways. He listed
his business in the 1965 edition of WHO'S WHO IN THE SOUTH AND
SOUTHWEST as "Presidential Adviser, c/o The White House, 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, D.C." The joke would later prove
to be somewhat of an embarrassment when President Johnson named
Fortas to be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United
States on July 28, 1965, but nothing could hide the fact that the Presi-
dent valued him as a trusted adviser and consulted him informally on a
wide range of matters. Fortas was not eager to accept appointment to

282
MONDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1982
the Court, but Johnson styled the nomination as a call to "vital duty”
and Fortas accepted. The President, noting Fortas' well-known reluc-
tance to assume public office again after twenty years in private life,
declared that "the job has sought the man-a scholar, a profound
thinker, a lawyer of superior ability and a man of deeply compassionate
feelings toward his fellow man."
Abe Fortas took the constitutional and judicial oaths on October 4,
1965, to become the ninety-fifth Justice to sit on the Supreme Court of
the United States. In the four terms that he sat as an Associate Justice
he wrote 106 opinions-forty opinions for the Court, twenty-one con-
curring opinions, and forty-five dissenting opinions. His importance to
the Court and to the nation during the parlous times in which he sat
cannot be measured by output. Part of his value lay, as Holmes said of
John Marshall, in the fact that he, and not someone else, was there dur-
ing "a strategic point in the campaign of history."
His opinions did not strive for rhetorical effect. He could reduce a
penetrating insight to a barbed phrase and he could summarize a com-
plicated constitutional concept in a glistening sentence, but the quality
of his work is not reflected in a string of memorable pearls. Each opin-
ion spoke crisply with the authority of a master craftsman who readily
apprehended the facts and arguments and who then went to the heart
of the matter without reinventing the wheel along the way. His passion
broke through the surface rarely, and then usually in cases involving
the civil rights of racial minorities or the investigative abuses of the po-
lice. In both areas, he rejected abstract characterizations that hid dis-
agreeable truths, and he sought to make equal protection of the laws.
and freedom from self-incrimination living realities and not technical
constructs.
The days that Justice Fortas sat on the Court lent themselves to pat
labels for characterizing complex social problems and the Court's role in
addressing those problems. How the future will regard his times is not
for us to say, but it is certain that he brought to his task a mature vision
that refused to accept simple formulas. "Constitutional commandments
are not surgical instruments," he wrote. "They have a tendency to hack
deeply to amputate." Avery v. Midland County, 390 U.S. 474, 497
(1968). He thus cautioned against the application of slogans to resolve
problems touching many institutions, and he warned that adjudication
was an inefficient tool to preserve constitutional guarantees: "The full
realization of our great charter of liberty, set forth in our Constitution,
cannot be achieved by this Court alone." Desist v. United States, 394
U.S. 244, 277 (1969). He also warned that courts should be chary of

MONDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1982
283
overreaching, especially where economic policy was at stake either in
the interpretation of the antitrust laws or in the review of agency ac-
tion: "The courts may be the principle guardians of the liberties of the
people. They are not the chief administrators of its economic destiny."
B. & O. R. Co. v. United States, 386 U.S. 372, 478 (1967).
His greatest contributions to the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court
touched on what he saw as the essence of the liberties guaranteed by
the Constitution, the procedures used by the criminal justice system.
In addition to numerous opinions on the Fifth Amendment, he wrote, in
the case of In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1 (1967), the charter of juvenile jus-
tice. He was acutely sensitive to the constitutional and procedural
rights of minors, not only those charged with breaking the law as in
Gault, but also those who wished to criticize public policy, Tinker v.
Des Moines School District, 393 U.S. 503 (1969), and those who sought
to learn more than one-sided orthodoxy, Epperson v. Arkansas, 393
U.S. 97 (1968). And he pleaded that the First Amendment had room to
protect individuals and families from the loss of their legitimate pri-
vacy. Time, Inc. v. Hill, 385 U.S. 374, 412 (1967).
Abe Fortas' tenure on the Supreme Court embraced a period in
which the law and its future were called into open question not only in
the courtroom but also in the streets. Although he invested remarkable
energy and industry in his court work, he could not ignore what he
viewed to be multiple threats to the law and to its basic organizing prin-
ciples for society. In 1968 he published a pamphlet which he had begun
before he joined the Court, Concerning Dissent and Civil Disobedi-
ence. He argued that civil disobedience was sometimes appropriate, but
that violence never was, because violence begat more violence and thus
destroyed the opportunities for peaceful social change. The book was
strangely misunderstood by some as a manifesto for lawlessness, but
nothing could have been further from Fortas' purpose or belief. "Demo-
cratic processes do indeed function," the small book concluded, "and
they can bring about fundamental response to fundamental demands,
and can do this without revolution, and despite the occasional violence
of those who either reject or have not attained the maturity and re-
straint to use, and not to abuse, their freedom. This is an extraordinary
tribute to our institutions." To confound those who mis-read him, he
elaborated his views in an address to the American College of Trial
Lawyers in August of 1968. "I say proudly that I am a man of the law,"
he began. He repeated his faith in the rule of law and his abhorrence of
violence, but he also issued a warning: "We will not tolerate violence or
lawlessness but at the same time we will protect and preserve despite

284
MONDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1982
the onslaught of those whose purported adherence to constitutional
principles conceals a danger to our institutions more virulent and dan-
gerous than outright attack—the possibilities of peaceful and orderly
change that our Constitution guarantees."
On June 27, 1968, President Johnson nominated Abe Fortas to be
Chief Justice of the United States to replace Earl Warren, who had an-
nounced the day before that he would retire as soon as a successor was
confirmed. The nomination never went to a vote in the Senate, because
Fortas asked on October 3 that his name be withdrawn from consider-
ation after stormy confirmation hearings where questions were raised
about decisions made by the Court both before and during his tenure,
about the pamphlet and about Fortas' extrajudicial activities. The
following Spring further questions were raised which, it became evi-
dent, could not be laid to rest short of a full confrontation. To Fortas,
the political implications of the controversy transcended personal vin-
dication. He knew, as he said, that “if I stayed on the Court, there
would be a constitutional confrontation that would go on for months. I
feel that there wasn't any choice for a man of conscience." Against the
urgings of friends and those who recognized the importance of his con-
tribution to the work of the Court, he resigned from the Court on May
14, 1969.
,
After the resignation, he resumed an active practice as an eminent
and valuable member of the bar. The practice was remarkably varied,
challenging and consuming. Of particular interest to him was the future
of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, with which he had a long associa-
tion and which he represented in his only argument before the Court
after leaving it.
He continued his manifold activities on behalf of the arts, and he occa-
sionally lectured. Although his work and his avocation seemed to fill a
twenty-five hour day, he always had time for friends. During the illness
that forced Justice Douglas to retire from the Court, and in the years
following, Fortas was on hand at a moment's notice.
The life of Abe Fortas was so full, so rich, and lived at such intensity
that it is possible we do not fully know the man we have lost. He recog-
nized his own complexity. The Supreme Court, he said, “brings you
face to face with the problems of what you really believe, and that ac-
counts for some of the transformations of men on the Court. Maybe if
I'd stayed on the Court long enough I'd have discovered a Fortas under
the Fortas under the Fortas. But it didn't happen."
Abe Fortas was not so much a man of contradictions as a man of great
tensions. An instinctive, emotional passion for justice and fair play un-

derlay his quiet and controlled public reserve; the man who moved so
easily in the corridors of power was acutely uncomfortable with the
trappings of that power, so much so that he could not bear to ride in the
back seat of a limousine alone, because he detested the distinction be-
tween the passenger and the driver that the seating arrangement sym-
bolized; and the active and diverse social life that he and Carolyn so en-
joyed was at odds with his lifelong gravity and social concern. Abe
Fortas bore the burden of the same kind of conscience that he perceived
in his friend and former partner Louis Eisenstein: “He believed in man
and man's capability. He believed-although life could not have been
easy for him, because he was a sensitive instrument, responding too
easily, too deeply, too quietly, too passionately to the vibrations of oth-
ers-not only those whom he knew, whose sorrows impinged upon his
life, but also to the unseen multitudes whose problems to him were not
abstract, but a personal agony and a personal responsibility."
We would not honor Abe Fortas properly, however, if our memory
were cast only in sadness at his departure. As he said of Eisenstein, in
that deep, deliberate, somewhat mournful voice which none who heard.
it can ever forget: "The death of a remarkable man is not just an end.
It is also a beginning. His death does not terminate his life. His life con-
tinues in each of those whom he has touched, and in thousands whom he
never encountered, but whose lives are better and richer because he
lived."
Wherefore, it is
RESOLVED, that we, the Bar of the Supreme Court of the United
States, express our grievous sense of loss upon the death of Justice Abe
Fortas, that we acknowledge our professional debt to him for his ac-
complishments as a lawyer, public servant and public citizen, and that
we gratefully recognize his enduring contributions to our profession, to
the arts and to the nation: It is further
RESOLVED, that the Chairman of our Committee on Resolutions be
directed to present these resolutions to the Court with the prayer that
they be embodied in its permanent records.
Submitted by the Committee on Resolutions: Howard R. Koven,
Chairman, Joseph A. Ball, Clark M. Clifford, Cathleen H. Douglas,
Thomas I. Emerson, Sheldon Karon, Edward H. Levi, James Paul
Linn, Abner J. Mikva, Phil C. Neal, Simon H. Rifkind, Charles S.

The Chief Justice said:
"Thank you, Mr. Solicitor General. The Court now recognizes the At-
torney General of the United States."

MONDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1982
Mr. Attorney General Smith addressed the Court as follows:
"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.
The Bar of the Court met today to honor the memory of Abe Fortas,
Associate Justice of the Supreme Court from 1965 to 1969.
Justice Fortas came to this Court after two extraordinary decades in
the private practice of law. He was the first lawyer appointed to the
Court directly from private practice in 35 years. He brought to the
Court not only the habits of mind of the outstanding private practi-
tioner, but the deeply felt concerns that shaped his own life.
As a young man, Justice Fortas came to Washington with the New
Deal. He served with distinction at the Agricultural Adjustment Ad-
ministration, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the De-
partment of the Interior-where he became the Undersecretary at 32.
From 1946 through 1965, Justice Fortas engaged in the private prac-
tice of law-founding his own firm, which became an exemplar of the
Washington practice. During this period, however, Justice Fortas did
not forsake public service. He demonstrated the importance of the law-
yer to the service of the public through his representation of a broad
range of clients. By appointment of the United States Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit and this Court, he successfully rep-
resented indigent clients in two historic cases. In the latter instance, he
made an important contribution to the work of this Court. In 1962, the
Court appointed him to brief and argue the cause of Clarence Earl Gid-
eon, a destitute Florida convict. The story is well known. And it is a
story that will continue to tutor future generations of law students and
lawyers concerning their responsibilities to the public as members of
the bar.
Justice Fortas' keen intellect, and his intolerance for obscure argu-
ments, were apparent both in his opinions and in the courtroom. One of
Justice Fortas' law partners has said that it was a dangerous gamble to
answer a question from him unless it could be done with certainty, and
that no one gambled more than once. Those who argued before him
quickly learned the same lesson. If there was a weakness in a lawyer's
argument, it was often Justice Fortas who would question the advocate
about it and not let him easily escape. The advocate's only consolation
was that when his opponent was making a questionable point, it was
again Justice Fortas who would often ask the incisive question and pur-
sue the issue relentlessly until the weaknesses of the argument were
fully revealed.
Although a member of this Court for less than four years, he played a
central role in the significant changes wrought during that period. He

MONDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1982
287
wrote forty opinions of the Court during those four terms. Although
considered by most a stalwart of the Warren Court, he revealed the nu-
ances of judgment that characterized his superb intellect by writing
twenty-one concurring opinions and forty-five dissents. On this Court-
as in private life-Mr. Fortas was his own man-indeed, a most re-
markable man whose unique insights were the result of exceptional ex-
perience, hard work, and a sharp intellect.
After leaving the Court, Justice Fortas returned to the private prac-
tice of law, and to a diverse life in which he devoted much of his time to
public service. He gave generously of his efforts to the John F. Ken-
nedy Center for the Performing Arts and to the National Endowment
for the Arts. From 1970 until his death he was a member of the Advi-
sory Committee on Appellate Rules of the Judicial Conference of the
United States. His law practice once again led him back before this
Court, where he presented another memorable oral argument only two
weeks before his death.
"
President Theodore Roosevelt once said that in life, “The credit be-
longs to the man. . . who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devo-
tions, and spends himself in a worthy cause . . . . Abe Fortas was
such a man. Throughout his life-which spanned a turbulent era of
change Justice Fortas proved himself a brilliant lawyer and a tireless
advocate for his clients and those principles he cherished. In public
service and in private life, he spent himself fully for those things in
which he believed. Those who agreed with him, and those who did not,
all recognize that Justice Fortas was always a magnificent advocate-
and so often a successful one.
Mr. Chief Justice, on behalf of the lawyers of this nation and, in par-
ticular, of the Bar of this Court, I respectfully request that the resolu-
tions presented to you in honor and celebration of the memory of Jus-
tice Fortas be accepted by this Court."
The Chief Justice said:
"Mr. Attorney General and Mr. Solicitor General, the Court thanks
you on behalf of the Bar for your presentations today in memory of our
late colleague and friend, Justice Fortas.
We ask that you convey to Chairman Koven and the members of the
Committee on Resolutions our profound appreciation for these very ap-
propriate resolutions. Your motion that these resolutions be made a
part of the permanent records of the Court is granted.
These resolutions of the Bar of the Court that you have presented,
Mr. Solicitor General and Mr. Attorney General, reveal a man who, for
all his skills as an advocate and for all his fine professional standing

288
MONDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1982
as a lawyer and as a Justice of this Court, was far more than a legal
technician.
There's very little to add to the resolutions you have presented in
terms of Abe Fortas' career as a Justice, as a lawyer and as a public
figure. In many respects, he was cut of the same cloth as so many of
those Eighteenth Century figures in our history who were as much at
home in the corridors of government as in the courtroom or in the con-
cert hall. His services in government, as the resolutions have told us,
began very early in his life, and very soon won him national recognition.
He was always vigorous in his support of or in his opposition to mea-
sures and to people when he disagreed. His public rebuke of Senator
Wayne Morse can really be appreciated best by the generation who re-
member Senator Wayne Morse as one of the powerful figures in the
Congress of the United States, and as a leading spokesman for liberal
causes.
Few people cared and even fewer dared to cross swords with Wayne
Morse in public debate. And Abe Fortas' courageous opposition to
the internment of Japanese Americans that has been referred to
in the resolutions was another example of his willingness to oppose
popular trends, including the entire force of President Roosevelt's.
administration.
I first became personally acquainted with Abe Fortas when I served
on the Court of Appeals and worked with him on Circuit Judicial Con-
ference committees. He had returned to private practice by the time I
came to this Court, and when we reactivated the important Judicial
Conference Committee to review the appellate rules, I asked him to
serve on it and he accepted.
In private conversations with him, I found that he shared the view
that judges and lawyers had a great obligation to work together to re-
duce the steadily mounting costs of appeals as cases became more com-
plex and as the cost of printed records sometimes ran into literally small
fortunes. Here his quick grasp of the realities, his vast experience
in the law made him a very valuable contributor to the work of that
Committee.
Abe Fortas was deeply involved, as the resolutions have indicated, in
the political life of the country much of his life, especially in the earlier
years. But one could not accurately say he was a politician, as that term
is commonly used in Washington. He was surely no hale fellow well
met. He saved his warmth for his friends and his close associates. Yet,
he played an important role in the political life on the level of ideas and
issues, beginning with the stirring days of the New Deal.

MONDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1982

One can easily visualize Abe Fortas as counsel to the truculent Har-
old Ickes, seeking to restrain the public outbursts of that dynamic
curmudgeon, as the Solicitor General's resolution has described him,
in order to protect the Secretary and enhance his effectiveness in
government.
Abe Fortas' role in the political life of his times was largely on an
intellectual level, as I have suggested. And as with any advocate, he
performed with great zest and vigor on behalf of the young Lyndon
Johnson in the Texas litigation that the Solicitor General has referred
to. And, of course, we know the result of that case was to place Lyndon
Johnson on the ballot for United States Senator and open his national
political career.
I have said that Abe Fortas was as much at home in the corridors of
government as in the courtroom, but that description fails to describe.
the complete man. From his childhood, he loved music and he never did
forsake his beloved violin. Yet, it would have been unnatural for a fine
musician, possessing the great talent that he exhibited, to confine his
interest in the arts simply to music. Quietly and effectively he sup-
ported many causes of the arts on a broad scale, notably, the Kennedy
Center, and it was his participation, at the request of President John-
son, that led to the Smithsonian Institution acquiring the great Hirsh-
horn collection and that was an essential step, for the project was not
without vigorous opposition.
The Solicitor General has referred to the final appearance of Abe
Fortas as an advocate in this Court, and that came shortly before his
death. That was the kind of case that called for his large grasp of the
realities and the practicalities of the business of government, as well as
an acute understanding of the relevant law. A unanimous Court found
in favor of Puerto Rico, one of his long-time clients.
Those who knew Abe Fortas as a cool, if not sometimes even a cold,
steely advocate in the competitive arenas of the law and of government
would have been somewhat baffled, I think, to have seen him as part of
a string quartet with his musician friends in a private home. These
groups, as the resolutions have noted, sometimes included some of the
leading figures in the world of music, Isaac Stern, Judith Serkin, Leon-
ard Rose.
Abe Fortas was as much at home with the music of Brahms, Mozart
and Rachmaninoff as with the treatises of Lord Coke and of Maitland.
Although he was a very private person, he did not make a point of
concealing his love for and the practice of music or his interest in the
arts. Neither did he flaunt it or exploit it. His love of the arts was a

290
MONDAY, DECEMBER 13, 1982
sincere expression and it tells something about the breadth of the man
and of his interests.
I was present, as many of you were, at the musicial memorial tribute
in May at the Eisenhower Theater when some of the great artists of
America paid tribute to this man with their music. We heard Isaac
Stern, Slava Rostropovich and others who had shared private musical
evenings with him. They played the Andante Movement from Mozart's
String Quintet, one of Abe Fortas' favorites. It was their way of paying
tribute to an Eighteenth Century man of the arts who was also a Twen-
tieth Century man of the Law.
Abe Fortas will be missed, not just by his life companion, Carolyn,
and by his family and his friends and colleagues at the Bar, but by all
those who have tried to make our Nation's Capital a center for the
beauty and serenity so essential today in the turbulent world that we
live in.
In a day of specialists and specialization, he will be remembered for
his contributions on many levels. As his love of the arts and music en-
riched his life, it served also to enrich the life of this great city and of
our country."
Adjourned until Monday, January 10, 1983 at 10 o'clock.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Present: Chief Justice Burger, Justice Brennan, Justice White, Jus-
tice Marshall, Justice Blackmun, Justice Powell, Justice Rehnquist,
Justice Stevens, and Justice O'Connor.
CERTIORARI SUMMARY DISPOSITION
No. 82-647. Donald J. Kirkpatrick, Petitioner v. Christian Homes of
Abilene, Inc., et al. On writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of
Texas, Eleventh Supreme Judicial District. The Court has considered
the memorandum filed by petitioner in response to the representations
of the State of Texas in its brief before this Court which bring to light a
question of state law not passed upon or relied upon below. The resolu-
tion of this question may establish that petitioner is entitled to the relief
he seeks as a matter of Texas statutory law. If this is so, a decision of
the constitutional question on which we granted certiorari would be un-
necessary. See Paschall v. Christie-Stewart, 414 U.S. 100 (1973);
Musser v. Utah, 333 U.S. 95 (1948). Accordingly, the judgment of the
Court of Appeals of Texas, Eleventh Supreme Judicial District, is va-
cated and the case is remanded to that Court for further proceedings to
determine whether, under Texas law, petitioner could have obtained
and may still obtain a decree designating him as the father of
his child pursuant to the provisions of Texas Family Code Sections
13.01-13.09. The Clerk is directed to issue the mandate forthwith.
ORDER IN PENDING CASE
No. 82-486. United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of Amer-
ca, Local 610, AFL-CIO, et al., Petitioners v. Paul E. Scott, et al. This
case is hereby scheduled for argument on April 26, 1983, in place of No.
82-647, Donald J. Kirkpatrick v. Christian Homes of Abilene, Inc.,
et al.

ing: After the Court of Appeals denied the Government's petition for
rehearing in this case, the Government voluntarily moved to dismiss
the indictments. On January 12, 1983, the District Court granted that
motion. No one has ever challenged the effectiveness of the District
Court's order of dismissal, or sought to set it aside, either by a request
for rehearing in that court or by direct review on appeal. It is, there-
fore, perfectly clear that this litigation terminated a long time ago.
Nothing remains to be decided on the merits with regard to United
States v. Ross or any other issue.
