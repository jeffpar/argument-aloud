yers here to take note of these events. We begin with Mr. Erwin
Griswold, former Solicitor General of the United States and former
Dean of Harvard Law School. Mr. Griswold.

MONDAY, OCTOBER 7, 1985
MR. GRISWOLD: Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
This Court and its bar live in what I believe is called symbiotic rela-
tionship. Each benefits from the presence of the other. At any rate,
the bar hopes that is an accurate statement.
The bar has its role, but it is not very cohesive. There is no pub-
lished list of the membership of this Court's bar and no organization of
it. Indeed, no one knows how many members there are. The Clerk's
office tells me that no applications were required until 1925.
Since then there have been applications, and these have been num-
bered serially. At the present time the number of such applications is
somewhat over 165,000. But there is no record of those who have died
or retired from active practice. As a guess, I would say that there are
about 75,000 lawyers in this country who are members of this Court's
bar.
It is a privilege to speak on their behalf and to express the apprecia-
tion of the bar for the important role which this Court plays in our con-
stitutional and legal structure.
We do know one thing: The first member of the bar of this Court was
Elias Boudinot of New Jersey, who was admitted in February 1790. Of
course, there was no one to move his admission, but this Court was
flexible. It had not yet established procedures for the filing of
credentials.
For the first few admissions, the Court apparently relied on judicial
notice. The judges knew who were the qualified lawyers and they were
admitted. After about a year, the Court turned to the Attorney Gen-
eral, Edmund Randolph. Though he was never admitted to practice be-
fore the Court, he was treated as an officer of the Court.
And before long, the practice was established of admission to the bar
on motion of persons already admitted. Under the first admissions
rule, adopted on February 5, 1790, the Court made the provision, which
continues to this day, that applicants for admission shall have been ad-
mitted for "three years past in the Supreme Courts of the state to
which they respectively belong."
The formula also provided then, as it did throughout the nineteenth
century, that the private and professional character of the applicants
"shall appear to be fair." As our language evolved, the word “fair” ac-
quired a double meaning, and the use of the phrase sometimes produced
a laugh in the courtroom. So the wording was changed, and for many
years in the twentieth century the sponsor was required to say that he
vouched for the applicant. Under the rule as it now stands, he affirms
that the applicant is of good moral and professional character.

MONDAY, OCTOBER 7, 1985

All motions for admission were made in open court until about 15
years ago. Now, in accordance with modern times, the whole proce-
dure can be done by mail.
Under the first rule for admission, the applicant was required to elect
whether he would practice as an attorney or as a counselor, and he
could not practice as both. If this rule had continued, the British dis-
tinction between solicitors and barristers would have been established
here, and we might have a narrower group today which could be recog-
nized as the bar of the Supreme Court.
Indeed, the Circuit Court for the First Circuit provided for four de-
grees: attorneys, counselors, barristers, and sergeants. Charles War-
ren in his "History of the American Bar" refers to an order by Justice
Story made in that court in 1812 admitting on his own motion Jeremiah
Smith and Jeremiah Mason to the degree of sergeant at law, and as far
as I know they are the only lawyers who have been sergeants at law in
this country.
Many great lawyers have appeared before the Court. John Marshall
appeared in one case in the late 1790's, unsuccessfully. Others who
may be mentioned are Luther Martin, Caesar Rodney, and Roger B.
Taney. These were the days of oratory, and by the 1830's Daniel Web-
ster achieved his long continued eminence before the Court.
His appearances were often great social events, with large crowds
both of men and women attending the Court sessions, for often several
days were devoted to a single case. In those days Webster argued sev-
eral hundred cases, more than have been presented before this Court
by any other person in its history.
Interestingly enough, the member of the bar with the second largest
total of arguments has left little trace. He was Walter Jones, admitted
to practice in 1796, and the United States Attorney in the District of
Columbia from 1802 to 1821.
In later years, he often acted in association with Daniel Webster.
Among others, he argued the case of Martin against Hunter's Lessee.
and McCullough against Maryland. He also appeared in the first hear-
ing of the Charles River Bridge case, where he was opposed by Daniel
Webster.
We ought to have more information about Walter Jones, and perhaps
the Supreme Court Historical Society can find a way to make him bet-
ter known.
The history of the Court and its bar is of course intertwined with the
history of the country. The details are being developed in the great his-
tory of the Court which is being prepared under the Oliver Wendell

84
MONDAY, OCTOBER 7, 1985
Holmes bequest. I will refer to only two events, both reflecting the
Court's interrelationship with the slow but steady progress which the
country made during the nineteenth century with two fundamental
problems.
The first black lawyer to be admitted to the bar of the Supreme Court
was Dr. John S. Rock, who was born of free parents in New Jersey in
1825. He was admitted on February 1st, 1865, just short of his fortieth
birthday. Before then he had been a teacher, a dentist, and a doctor.
He had moved to Boston in 1853 and he was one of the founders of the
Republican Party in Massachusetts.
In 1858 he wanted to go to France for medical treatment, but he was
refused a passport on the ground that he was not a citizen. The Massa-
chusetts legislature then passed a law providing for state passports-
I'm not sure this Court would accept that today-and this was accepted
in France.
A year or so later, Dr. Rock returned to Boston and began to read
law. He was admitted to practice in Massachusetts in September 1861
and he was admitted to practice in this Court on February 1, 1865.
Note that date-shortly after the appointment of Salmon P. Chase as
Chief Justice.
This came before the final termination of the Civil War and before the
adoption of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments
and with the Dred Scott case still on the books. As the New York Tri-
bune reported: "By Jupiter, the sight was good." It must have been
one of the dramatic moments in this Court's history, at least in
retrospect.
Rock's admission was moved by Senator Charles Sumner. The news-
paper reported observed that “The assenting nod of the Chief Justice
dug the grave to bury the Dred Scott decision."
I am glad to record, too, that one of the persons who encouraged Dr.
Rock was George L. Ruffin, whom we believe to be the first black grad-
uate of the Harvard Law School.
The next event to which I will refer was the admission of the first
woman to the Supreme Court bar. In 1872, this Court had refused to
interfere with the action of the Supreme Court of Illinois, which denied
admission to Myra Bradwell, who was the wife of a judge in Chicago.
She relied in this Court on the equal protection clause of the recently
adopted Fourteenth Amendment, but was unsuccessful. It may be
mentioned that Chief Justice Chase was the sole dissenter from this
conclusion.

"

It was less than seven years later, though, that Belva A. Lockwood
became the first woman admitted to practice before the Court. This
was on March 3rd, 1879. So quick was the change of view that this
evoked no opinion from any member of the Court. Indeed, Mrs.
Bradwell, who was denied admission in 1872, was finally admitted when
she applied again in March 1892 on motion of Attorney General
W. H. H. Miller.
Alice O'Donnell has pointed out in her paper in the 1977 Yearbook of
the Supreme Court Historical Society that it took 41 years or until 1929
before the first 100 women became members of the bar of the Court.
Some of the early admittees had great careers in the law. I will men-
tion only Florence Allen, who became the first woman judge of a con-
stitutional federal court; Mabel Walker Willebrand, who was Assistant
Attorney General under President Hoover; and Helen Carloss, who had
a long and distinguished career in the Tax Division of the Department
of Justice and was an extraordinarily persuasive lawyer in the federal
courts, including this Court.
A great increase in the number of women lawyers has occurred in the
past 15 years. In another 15 years, if present trends continue, perhaps
30 percent of the members of the bar of this Court will be women. This
will surely have an important impact, though it is not as yet clear just
what that impact will be.
Is there a bar of this Court? It is hard to say. There have been peri-
ods when there was a relatively small group of lawyers who were
widely recognized as leaders of the bar of this Court. They were the
orators of the nineteenth century, starting with Daniel Webster and
continuing through John G. Johnson of Pennsylvania.
There was a bar in the 1920's and 1930's, when such lawyers as
Charles Evans Hughes, Owen D. Roberts, John W. Davis, George
Wharton Pepper, and William D. Mitchell made frequent appearances
before the Court. By this time, oratory was passe. The presentations
were less flowery, but they were mellifluous.
As a young lawyer, I was fascinated by John W. Davis and his skill at
crossing thin ice with great artistry, reaching the other side safely be-
fore it was fully recognized that the ice was so thin.
There is one case which I recall which brought together three of
these giants. This was United States against George Otis Smith in
1932. It involved the question whether the Senate could reconsider the
confirmation of a presidential nomination after the President had acted
on it.

86
MONDAY, OCTOBER 7, 1985
The Senate retained John W. Davis as its counsel. Attorney General
William D. Mitchell appeared for the United States, essentially repre-
senting the President. And George Wharton Pepper represented Mr.
Smith. That was surely one of the high points of advocacy in this
century.
With the great increase in ease and speed of travel since World War
Two, there is much less concentration on work before the Court, al-
though it has never been highly concentrated since the days of Daniel
Webster and Walter Jones. This is inevitable in a country as large and
diverse as this country is.
It might have been different if the original division between attor-
neys and counselors had prevailed. It is hard to think, though, that
such an arrangement, while having some advantages, would have been
a good one overall. In any event, it is really impossible to have such
distinctions in this country.
There is one group which has long provided the backbone of the
Supreme Court bar. That is the Solicitor General and his staff and his
associates in the Department of Justice. This office has long main-
tained a high standard and a great tradition. It appears in one way or
another in nearly half of the cases which are heard on the merits by the
Court and in a high percentage of all applications for review.
I should also refer to the considerable number of cases which have
been presented here by what we now know as special interest groups.
I think, for example, of the work done in the early days of the NAACP,
which was represented here by one of the country's great lawyers,
Charles Hamilton Houston, work which was carried on later with great
ability by Thurgood Marshall. And I may mention the work done by
lawyers representing groups interested in the rights of women, of
whom Ruth Bader Ginsburg was an outstanding example.
The bar of this Court has a somewhat difficult role. As I have indi-
cated, it is scattered and diverse. It can never be assembled, nor is it
possible to take a consensus of the bar. Nevertheless it is clear, at least
to me, that the Court could not get along without it.
Yet, the demands on the Court are such that the bar finds difficulty
in making its full contribution. Fifty years ago when the Court first
met in this building, it heard arguments five days a week for a total of
about 75 days a year. Now it hears arguments for about 45 days during
the year.
Fifty years ago, the time made available for oral arguments was an
hour on each side and there were frequent substantial allowances of ad-

1
MONDAY, OCTOBER 7, 1985
87
ditional time. Now the time allotted is 30 minutes on a side and addi-
tional time is, shall I say, a very scarce commodity.
This inevitably presents problems for the oral advocate and requires
a wholly different type of argument from that which was customary
even 50 years ago. The lawyer today can rarely deal with his case as a
case. He has to pick out certain salient points and hope that, with the
welcome questioning, he will have time to deal with the matters he re-
gards as vital.
I think that the briefs today are on average much better than they
were 50 years ago, probably more improved than is commonly recog-
nized. But oral argument often remains a difficult and somewhat tanta-
lizing field.
This Court moved into this great building 50 years ago today. Ac-
cording to the newspaper articles, the first words spoken by Chief Jus-
tice Hughes in this courtroom were: "Are there any admissions?” Thus
was the bar recognized, and thus has it been recognized at every ses-
sion since.
The Court heard no arguments on the opening day. There were,
however, many admissions, including Harold B. Willey, Chief Deputy
Clerk of the Court, and Mary Agnes Quinn, the Docket Clerk in the
Solicitor General's Office.
The first business before the Court was a motion made, appropriately
enough, by Solicitor General Stanley F. Reed. The first case was ar-
gued before the Court a week later on October 14th. That was the case
of Douglas against Wilcutts. It was a tax case, and it was, too, the first
case whose decision was announced in this room. It is reported in 296
U. S., page 1.
Just as we are hearing these days in cases before the Court about
non-bank banks, verbally a rather odd concept, I think I may well close
these remarks by referring to the non-bar bar. For the brief for Doug-
las in that case was written by a young lawyer who had graduated from
the Harvard Law School in 1932 and had not yet completed the three
years required for admission here. Thus his name, though on the brief,
does not appear in United States Reports, since he was a member of the
non-bar bar.
He was, though, well worthy of the assignment. His name later be-
came well known here. He was Harry A. Blackmun.
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Griswold.
Mr. Attorney General.
ATTORNEY GENERAL MEESE: Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the
Court:

88
MONDAY, OCTOBER 7, 1985
It is a privilege for me to be here today representing the Department
of Justice and the Executive Branch of the Government in these
proceedings.
Fifty years ago on the date that we are commemorating here, this
nation was in the midst of a great Depression. To borrow Tom Paine's
language of an earlier critical period in our history, it was a crisis that
truly did try men's souls.
The problems of that era were deeper than economic despair and De-
pression. The deepest problem, the greatest threat of that time, was
that our very system of government had been called into question. It
was a time where our fundamental precepts of democracy were being
challenged from without as well as from within.
Our great national economic tragedy came at a time when new and
foreign ideologies were attacking the very soul and spirit of free and
democratic institutions around the world. The communist and fascist
movements abroad were gaining strength and sought to promote them-
selves as the dominant force in the world, at the expense of liberty and
peace.
In the midst of an increasingly confused and confusing world, the
structure we honor today arose here in our nation's capital. As though
to serve as a moral beacon to all the world, the new building of the
Supreme Court stood forth, dedicated to that most basic principle of
civilization, the rule of law.
Equal justice under law, that is what we as a people stood for then,
as we had since the founding of our Republic; and that is what we as a
people stand for today.
Now as then, this Court in many ways represents our national vision
of a just and civilized world. As in impartial and independent institu-
tion under our Constitution, the Supreme Court, symbolic of our entire
Judiciary, gives practical effect to the idea of the rule of law.
In The Federalist Papers, as in other writings during our founding
period, this Court was deemed to be an essential part of that new sci-
ence of government which had led to the framing of the Constitution.
Alexander Hamilton confessed that under the previous Articles of Con-
federation the lack of a judiciary was a crowning defect. After all, he
said, “laws are a dead letter without courts to expound and define their
true meaning and operation."
"
Indeed, Hamilton went on to say that "the complete independence of
the courts of justice is peculiarly essential in a limited constitution.
He concluded that "a constitution is in fact and must be regarded by the
judges as a fundamental law. Without this understanding and without

MONDAY, OCTOBER 7, 1985
89
an independent judiciary to guard the lines and the limits of the original
constitution, all the particular rights or privileges of that constitution
would amount to nothing."
The magnificent structure in which we are now gathered symbolizes
both the necessary independence and the constitutional integrity of the
Supreme Court. It stands apart from, yet is near to, the homes of the
other two branches.
It is a serious and a solemn place. In terms of those who wrote in
The Federalist Papers, there is no wielding of the sword nor control of
the purse strings here. There is, as the founders prescribed, only
judgment.
I congratulate this Court as it celebrates its first 50 years in this mag-
nificent marble building, a temple of reason, a temple of justice, and a
temple of law.
Thank you.
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Attorney General.
The Court recognizes Mr. William Falsgraf, the President of the
American Bar Association, to speak for the legal profession as a whole.
Mr. Falsgraf.
MR. FALSGRAF: Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
I am truly delighted to bring the congratulations and best wishes of
the American Bar Association and in fact all of the lawyers of America
as the Supreme Court celebrates 50 years in this magnificent hall. As
spokesman for the American legal profession, I want to express on be-
half of my colleagues across the country our profound respect for the
Court, both before and after it obtained this permanent home.
We know that for some 144 years the Court performed its constitu-
tional duties with dedication and often with brilliance despite the lack of
an adequate and dignified quarters. Nevertheless, there is indeed sym-
bolic importance in its having an impressive and dignified home.
Our Association has recognized and acknowledged that fact since the
first foundation stone of this building was laid some 53 years ago. For
we recognize that appropriate physical surroundings are essential in-
order for the Court to serve as our nation's primary symbol of the rule
of law.
Generations of Americans and guests from around the world have
visited this building and been overwhelmed by its grace and by its dig-
nity. This is indeed a hallowed place, an appropriate acknowledgment
by the people of the United States of the critical role which the third
coequal branch of government plays in our constitutional form of
government.

MONDAY, OCTOBER 7, 1985
The special feeling that we in the ABA have for this building was first
given expression by leaders of the Association who were intimately in-
volved in the construction and dedication of this edifice. The energy
and the leadership with respect to the construction of this building of
course came from Chief Justice William Howard Taft, who was a for-
mer President of the American Bar Association as well as a former
President of the United States of America. And incidentally, Chief
Justice Taft was a fellow Ohioan, of which I am personally quite proud.
Unfortunately, Chief Justice Taft died in 1930, before his dream of a
permanent home for this Court could take shape. But his widow was
present at the cornerstone laying of this building in 1932. This was in-
deed an appropriate recognition of the leading role which Chief Justice
Taft played in the planning for and the ultimate approval for the design
and construction of this temple of the law.
All three speakers at the laying of the cornerstone had served or
were serving as President of the American Bar Association. Guy
Thompson of St. Louis, who represented the legal profession, was of
course then Acting President of the American Bar Association. The
Honorable John W. Davis, who spoke for the bar of the Supreme Court,
had served as President of the American Bar Association in 1922-23.
And Chief Justice Hughes himself, speaking for the Court, had been
ABA President in 1924-25.
The text of these speeches were among the articles that were placed
within the cornerstone of this building. In his remarks, President
Thompson predicted that this building would be "a monument to jus-
tice," and how prophetic those comments have become.
John W. Davis called this place "the abode of the peacemaker" and
"the house of refuge for all such as are oppressed."
In response, Chief Justice Hughes said: "This building is the symbol
of the distinctive character of the Republic, the symbol of its faith. It
suggests permanence, not the permanence of stone and steel but of an
idea, a testimonial to an imperishable idea of liberty under law."
Well, tremendous changes have swept over this land in the past 50
years, and yet the dedicatory sentiments of my predecessors, like the
beauty and the grace of this building, are as relevant and apt today as
they were 50 years ago.
As we look to the Court's next 50 years and beyond, it is entirely ap-
propriate for us to pause and to do as we are today, acknowledging that
which is past. When this Court was established, constitutional govern-
ment was indeed a revolutionary idea, and perhaps still is in other parts
of the world. The form of nearly every other government which was

MONDAY, OCTOBER 7, 1985
91
then in existence almost 200 years ago has changed so drastically as to
be virtually unrecognizable to their subjects of two centuries ago.
Many of the fundamental tenets of scientific knowledge which were
the presumption of that age have been found to be flawed when exam-
ined under the light of newly discovered truths involving matter, en-
ergy, space, and time. The industrial revolution has come and gone,
the atomic age has arrived. And yet, our nation and the Constitution
under which it operates have not only endured, they have thrived.
How fitting is it, then, that we celebrate today the tangible symbol of
that durability which is this building. The American people owe a debt
beyond counting to the Supreme Court of the United States as the de-
finitive interpreter of the Constitution, our highest law.
This Court is not only the refuge for all such as are oppressed, it is
the bulwark of freedom for every citizen, regardless of his or her sta-
tion in life. For just as the cornerstone serves as the support for the
walls and the roof of this building, so the Constitution makes it great.
Let us give thanks, then, first to the architects of this building and all
of those who labored to make that design a reality. But let us give
greater thanks to the architects of our Constitution and those who labor
within these laws to make the blessings of freedom secured by that
Constitution a continuing reality.
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: Thank you, Mr. Falsgraf.
As Mr. Griswold has noted in his excellent statement, when the
Court gathered here precisely 50 years ago today at 12:00 noon it did
not undertake to hear oral arguments, but formally opened the Term
and then retired to the Conference Room and undertook to deal with
the accumulation of petitions for certiorari, jurisdictional statements,
and motions that had accumulated during the summer.
In recent years, the pressure of the docket has led the Court to hold
the conferences on the summer accumulation in the last week of Sep-
tember so that we could begin, as we did this morning, at 10:00 o'clock
to hear oral arguments.
The tortoise, which Cass Gilbert employed in much of his design in
this Building, is of course, a more ancient symbol of justice than the
blindfolded lady for both justice and the law are like the tortoise, rather
than the swift hare of the fable.
Yet some changes have occurred, as some of the speakers have com-
mented. In 1935, as Mr. Griswold said, the Court allowed one hour for
each side and sometimes more, and was able to hear two cases each day
or ten cases a week with a conference on Saturday. This was changed
about 15 years ago when we limited the oral argument to 30 minutes on

92
MONDAY, OCTOBER 7, 1985
each side. Now we hear 12 cases a week, leaving Thursday free for the
Justices to prepare for the Friday Conference. On Saturday and on
Sunday, the Justices are still engaged in the work of the Court. The
time allowed for oral argument is now very different from an earlier
day.
In the Dartmouth College case, for example, after some days of oral
argument, we can well imagine that Chief Justice Marshall may have
said to Daniel Webster: "Mr. Webster, you have now had three and a
half days; do you think you will finish this week?" Contrast that, if you
will, with the legend-and it has not been verified-that when the red
light came on in Chief Justice Hughes' time, he would stop a lawyer in
the middle of the word “if.”
Of course, we are much more liberal now. We allow a lawyer to fin-
ish the sentence that is unfolding when the red light goes on, provided,
of course, the sentence is not too long.
Sometimes, as close observers of the Court observed, we Justices do
not always fully agree about everything, and that was true when the
Chief Justice began his efforts to have this Building erected. Some of
the Justices felt it was not a good idea for the Court to lose regular con-
tact with the leaders of Congress whose support was needed for what-
ever it was that the Court needed.
There may have been some merit to that view, but Chief Justice Taft
was concerned more, as the speakers have indicated, with matters
other than the comfort and the needs of the Justices. He was pro-
foundly concerned with the need for a visible symbol of the independ-
ence of the third branch of government as a separate and a co-equal
branch.
The differing views of the Justices at that time was illustrated in a
story, perhaps a legend, of 1935 that one Justice is reported to have
said that he expected each member of the Court would be provided with
an elephant to ride into the Building mounted on that elephant much
like a rajah. Just how those elephants were going to negotiate those
steep stairs out in front of the Building has never been made clear.
Habits of judges and Justices, as with lawyers, change slowly. Hav-
ing worked in their homes with their clerks and secretaries at hand,
there was no great rush on the part of the Justices to occupy this splen-
did building, with luxurious three-room suites provided for each
Justice.
Chief Justice Hughes himself continued to work out of his home for
the most part and came to Court, as he put it, chiefly to hang his hat

and also to take care of the rapidly increasing administrative duties of
that office.
When Hugo Black was confirmed as a member of the Court he had
the choice of any one of eight suites in the Building, and he wisely se-
lected a very choice corner suite and occupied that space throughout his
entire tenure on the Court.
With all his foresight, Chief Justice Taft and the architect were not
able to fully anticipate the future needs of the Court, and so about 15
years ago, Justices' chambers were enlarged by converting each of
three suites into two and then creating three sets of new chambers.
This required that the Clerk of the Court move from this floor to the
ground floor. Previously, Chief Justice Warren had moved the Admin-
istrative Office of the United States Courts out of this Building in order
to meet the growing needs of the Court itself.
Electric typewriters supplanted the manual power machines, and, in
turn, they were recently replaced by word processing machines, which
then in turn supplanted the hot lead typesetting process used for pre-
paring the opinions of the Court.
The classical grandeur of this Building has been enhanced by the ad-
vent of the Office of the Curator of the Court. Miss Kathy Hetos, the
first Curator, served from 1974 to 1976 and was succeeded by Miss Gail
Galloway, the present Curator. Working with that man-of-all-skills,
Mr. Edward Douglas, a long-time member of the Supreme Court staff,
the Lower Great Hall has become a museum of the history of the Court
and the history of the Building itself. The work of these people can be
observed by those of you who take the time to see the special exhibit
that has just been completed on Chief Justice Taft in the Lower Great
Hall.
In these efforts to make this great symbol of justice come alive, the
cooperation of Mr. George White, the Architect of the Capitol, has been
very important. Mr. White turned to architecture only after graduat-
ing from Harvard Law School, and naturally has a sensitive apprecia-
tion of both the work of the Architect, Cass Gilbert and of the law.
The Attorney General and the President of the American Bar Associ-
ation have alluded to world events occurring soon after the Court sat
here, some of them before the Court sat here. Few statesmen of Eu-
rope and probably fewer in this country fully understood the meaning of
the rise of men like Mussolini and Hitler and the expansion of commu-
nism and the other dictatorships of the world of the 1930's.
Whether Chief Justice Taft saw the trends in Europe as undermining
justice and were to destroy established systems of freedom, we do not

94
MONDAY, OCTOBER 7, 1985
know. What is important was that at a great cataclysmic epoch in his-
tory, when dictators first destroyed independent courts and thus left no
barriers to protect free speech and free press and other freedoms, this
Building became a symbol, as the Attorney General and Mr. Falsgraf
have said, not only to Americans but to the whole world, a symbol of
the role and the function of a truly independent judiciary.
So, as we pause for an hour to take note of this fiftieth year of a great
monument to justice and to freedom under law, we do well to remember
both the events of interest in that half century and the meaning in a
larger sense, of this edifice as a symbol of a system that has endured for
two centuries. With all of the shortcomings of human institutions, our
system remains a beacon and a guide to people everywhere who seek
freedom.
In laying the cornerstone of the Building, Chief Justice Hughes said:
"This Republic endures and this Building is the symbol of its faith.”
Mr. Griswold, Mr. Attorney General, Mr. Falsgraf, on behalf of the
Court I thank you for your part in this proceeding, the record of which
will become part of the permanent records of this Court.

MONDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1985
243
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Present: Chief Justice Burger, Justice Brennan, Justice White,
Justice Marshall, Justice Blackmun, Justice Powell, Justice Rehnquist,
Justice Stevens, and Justice O'Connor.
The Chief Justice said:
"It is my sad duty to announce that our distinguished colleague and
friend, Justice Potter Stewart, died Saturday, December 7, 1985, in
Hanover, New Hampshire.
Justice Stewart served as a Judge of the United States Court of
Appeals for the Sixth Circuit from 1954 to 1958 when he was appointed
to this Court to succeed Justice Harold Burton. He took office on Octo-
ber 14, 1958, and served as an Associate Justice for 23 years until his
retirement in 1981 at the close of the 1980 Term of Court. He had
served his country for four years in the United States Navy in World
War II.
His appointment to the Court of Appeals in 1954 came at the age of
39, making him the youngest Federal Judge in the country at that time.
His opinions on a wide range of subjects appear in nearly 100 volumes of
the United States Reports covering a period of great social, political
and economic development reflecting the turmoil, upheavals and
changes taking place throughout the world.
Those changes had a marked impact on the kinds of issues coming
into all courts including this Court. In meeting these issues in the
setting of the dramatic changes in the world at large, Justice Stewart
exhibited a steadiness of purpose, comprehension and grasp of contem-
porary law and its antecedents in the Common Law.
His work as a Justice rejected the popular labels and categorizations
of judges. Adhering to precedent he sought to resolve cases on narrow
grounds leaving related but unresolved issues to the future. He was
particularly concerned that the rights of privacy of person and home,
protected by the Fourth Amendment be observed by all levels of gov-
ernment. Few legal issues concerned him more than the protection of
the rights envisaged by those who drafted the Constitution and the Bill
of Rights.
We mourn Justice Stewart's passing but we will not forget the com-
radeship and friendship that overshadowed the inescapable differences
arising in the processes of resolving the difficult issues that find their
way to this Court.

244
MONDAY, DECEMBER 9, 1985
I speak for all members of the Court in expressing our profound sym-
pathy to Mrs. Stewart and her family.
In due course, the traditional memorial service of the Bar of this
Court and the Court will be conducted in this Chamber to pay our re-
spects more fully to Justice Stewart."
The Chief Justice said:
"Today's orders of the Court have been certified by the Chief Justice,
filed with the Clerk, and will not be announced orally."

FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 1986
887
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Present: Chief Justice Burger, Justice Brennan, Justice White, Jus-
tice Marshall, Justice Blackmun, Justice Powell, Justice Rehnquist,
Justice Stevens, and Justice O'Connor.
The Chief Justice said:
"This special sitting of the Court is held to receive the Commissions
of the newly appointed Chief Justice of the United States, William H.
Rehnquist, and the newly appointed Associate Justice, Antonin Scalia.
"This year, on the eve of the 200th anniversary of our Constitution, it
is natural that we take a look back. Just one year ago, in this Chamber,
we took note that for a half century the Court has held its hearings and
has conducted all of its judicial business in this magnificent building de-
signed by Cass Gilbert under the direction of Chief Justice Taft. Chief
Justice Taft sought to underscore the separation of powers and the in-
dependence of the judiciary by having this building become, as it is, a
symbol of that constitutional division of powers and the symbol of the
supremacy of the law.
"As we know, Chief Justice Taft died before the Court first sat here.
Chief Justice Hughes succeeded him and was the first Chief Justice to
preside over the Court on this bench. In the 50 years since then, three
others have held the office following Chief Justice Hughes. Chief Jus-
tice Stone, Chief Justice Vinson and Chief Justice Warren.
"In these past 50 years, the Court has dealt with changing conditions
and a growing and complex society; more and more people seek to have
more and more issues resolved by the courts.
"Since the Court first sat on February 1, 1790, it has been called on to
respond to new, different and changing questions. The Court's re-
sponses to those questions during the 196 years since that first sitting
reflect, in a sense, the spirit of the common law from which our law de-
rives. Changes in the Court do not alter the basic continuity of the
spirit that activates the Court as an institution under the Constitution.
Many times each year the meaning of that grant document is debated at
this very lectern, and this confirms John Marshall's description of the
Constitution as a living document whose meaning reasonable persons
can and do disagree about while sharing common ideals. This history of
this Court is one of continuity with change. Change and continuity.
"Seventeen years ago, on an occasion like this, in this Chamber,
Chief Justice Warren, my distinguished predecessor, expressed the

888
FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 1986
thoughts that I know all Justices shared then, and I am sure we share
today. He said this:
'We do not always agree (and) it is not likely ever, with human
nature as it is, for nine (Justices) always to agree . . . If it ever
comes to pass,' he said, 'I would say that the Court will have lost
its strength and will no longer be a real force in the affairs of our
country.'
"I have no doubt whatever that Chief Justice Warren on that day,
and all of us who heard him here on June 23, 1969, were thinking of
countries and the millions of people who are not allowed to dissent and
where freedom does not exist, as our freedoms do, and as our freedoms
flow from 'we the people.'
"Now, today, I have the honor, and it is a great personal privilege as
well, to welcome our friend and colleague of 15 years, Justice William
H. Rehnquist as the 16th Chief Justice of the United States. I wish him
and I know I speak for all of my colleagues, I wish him and our new
colleague, Judge Scalia, good health, long life and God speed.
"Now, I recognize the Attorney General of the United States, Mr.
Meese."
The Attorney General said:
"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, I have the commis-
sion which has been issued to the Honorable William H. Rehnquist as
Chief Justice of the United States. The commission has been duly
signed by the President of the United States and attested by me as the
Attorney General of the United States. I move that the Clerk read the
commission and that it be made part of the permanent records of this
Court."
The Chief Justice said:
"Thank you Mr. Attorney General; your motion is granted. Mr.
Clerk, will you please read the commission?"
The Clerk then read the commission as follows:
"Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America,
"To All who shall See These Presents, Greeting:
"Know Ye; That reposing special trust and confidence in the Wisdom,
Uprightness, and Learning of William H. Rehnquist, of Virginia, I have
nominated, and, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, do
appoint him Chief Justice of the United States and do authorize and em-

Dear Chief:
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES,
Washington, D.C., September 17, 1986.
Your decision to retire stirs in each of us a deep sense of loss that our association
as colleagues on the Court must come to an end. Your zest for life and the extreme
kindness and compassion you have always shown each of us has enriched our rela-
tionship beyond measure.
You have believed that it is wrong to live life without some deep abiding social
commitment, and have devoted your entire professional life to pursuit of the elu-
sive goals of freedom. The many noteworthy opinions you have authored covering

FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 26, 1986
the broad spectrum of issues that erupted in your seventeen years as Chief Justice
constitute a major contribution to America's constitutional jurisprudence. The im-
pact of these opinions will be lasting upon the problem areas fundamental in our
constitutional democracy-the permutations and changing shapes of authority,
justice, privacy, responsibility, participation, diversity, property and freedom.
It is with great reluctance that we reconcile ourselves to your retirement, and do
so with our assurance of the great regard and affection in which we hold you. Our
hope for the future is that you enjoy the best of health and many opportunities to
devote yourself to projects that you enjoy.
Sincerely,
William J. Brennan, Jr.
Byron R. White
Thurgood Marshall
Harry A. Blackmun

Dear Justices:
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES,
Washington, D.C., September 18, 1986.
Your generous message concerning my retirement as Chief Justice so as to
devote full time to the Commission on the Bicentennial of the United States Con-
stitution gives me great satisfaction. To serve with you, and earlier with such
splendid men as Hugo Black, Bill Douglas, John Harlan and Potter Stewart, has
been a major satisfaction in my life. To leave this seat with such a warm message
from you gives added satisfaction.
As the Court's burdens in these seventeen Terms have so greatly increased in
volume and complexity, yours in the years ahead will continue to enlarge. I wish
for each of you good health and the rewards of satisfaction due for the burdens you
have carried and will carry in the service of our country and the great mandate set
forth at Philadelphia 199 years ago.
:
Sincerely,
Warren E. Burger
