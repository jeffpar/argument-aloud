uty Solicitor General Eric J. Feigin for the respondent in support of
affrmance, and by Ms. Morgan L. Ratner for Court-appointed amicus
curiae in support of the judgment below.
  The Chief Justice said:
  “Ms. Ratner, this Court appointed you to brief and argue this case
as an amicus curiae in support of the judgment below. You have ably
discharged that responsibility, for which we are grateful.”
  No. 21–846. John Montenegro Cruz, Petitioner v. Arizona. Argued
by Mr. Neal K. Katyal for the petitioner, and by Mr. Chief Deputy
Attorney General Joseph A. Kanefeld for the respondent.


  Adjourned until Wednesday, November 2, 2022, at 10 o'clock.


                      Order in Pending Case
   No. 22A337. Lindsey Graham, United States Senator, Applicant v.
Fulton County Special Purpose Grand Jury. Application for stay and
injunction pending appeal presented to Justice Thomas and by him
referred to the Court denied. The order heretofore entered by Justice
Thomas is vacated.
   The lower courts assumed that the informal investigative fact-
fnding that Senator Graham assertedly engaged in constitutes legisla-
tive activity protected by the Speech or Debate Clause, U. S. Const.
Art. I, § 6, cl. 1, and they held that Senator Graham may not be ques-
tioned about such activities. The lower courts also made clear that
Senator Graham may return to the District Court should disputes arise
regarding the application of the Speech or Debate Clause immunity to
specifc questions. Accordingly, a stay or injunction is not necessary to
safeguard the Senator's Speech or Debate Clause immunity.

                       Order in Pending Case
  No. 22A544 (22–592). Arizona, et al., Applicants v. Alejandro May-
orkas, Secretary of Homeland Security. Application for stay pending
certiorari presented to the Chief Justice and by him referred to the
Court granted. The November 15, 2022 order of the United States Dis-
trict Court for the District of Columbia, case No. 1:21-cv-00100, is
hereby stayed. Applicants suggested this Court treat the application
as a petition for a writ of certiorari; doing so, the petition is granted.
The parties are directed to brief and argue the following question:
Whether the State applicants may intervene to challenge the District
Court's summary judgment order.
  This stay precludes giving effect to the District Court order setting
aside and vacating the Title 42 policy; the stay itself does not prevent
the federal government from taking any action with respect to that
policy. The Court's review on certiorari is limited to the question of
intervention. While the underlying merits of the District Court's sum-
mary judgment order are pertinent to that analysis, the Court does
not grant review of those merits, which have not yet been addressed
by the Court of Appeals.
  The Clerk is directed to establish a briefng schedule that will allow
the case to be argued in the February 2023 argument session. The stay
shall terminate upon the sending down of the judgment of this Court.
The order heretofore entered by The Chief Justice is vacated.
  Justice Sotomayor and Justice Kagan would deny the application.
  Justice Gorsuch, with whom Justice Jackson joins, dissenting.

  Present: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Thomas, Justice Alito, Justice
Sotomayor, Justice Kagan, Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, Justice
Barrett, and Justice Jackson.

                      Order in Pending Cases

  No. 21–1484. Arizona, et al., Petitioners v. Navajo Nation, et al.; and
  No. 22–51. Department of the Interior, et al., Petitioners v. Navajo
Nation, et al. Motion of the Solicitor General for divided argument
granted.


   The Chief Justice said:
    “The Court is in Special Session this afternoon to receive the resolu-
tions of the Bar of the Supreme Court in tribute to Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg. The Court recognizes the Solicitor General.”
   The Solicitor General said:
   “Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
   “At a meeting today of the Bar of this Court, resolutions memorializ-
ing our deep respect and affection for Justice Ginsburg were adopted
unanimously.
   “Today, the Bar of this Court gathers to pay tribute to Justice Gins-
burg, a path-marking jurist who served the nation for 27 years as an
Associate Justice of this Court.
   “Justice Ginsburg dedicated her life to making real the Constitution's
promise of equality under the law and the framers' aspiration that we
build a more perfect Union.
   “She helped transform the landscape of this country, fghting discrim-
ination and forging opportunities for all persons to achieve their poten-
tial. All told, she authored over 1,100 opinions, each a model of her
characteristic effciency, clarity, and decency.
   “The Torah's command `justice, justice thou shalt pursue' graced the
wall of her chambers and inspired her in everything she did.
   “Joan Ruth Bader was born in Brooklyn in 1933, the daughter and
granddaughter of immigrants. From early on, Justice Ginsburg was
heavily infuenced by her mother, who she said taught her two lessons.
In Justice Ginsburg's words, `One was to be a lady, and that meant
conduct yourself civilly; don't let emotions like envy or anger get in
418                       FRIDAY, MARCH 17, 2023

your way. And the other was to be independent, which was an unusual
message for mothers of that time to be giving their daughters.'
   “At Cornell University, Justice Ginsburg studied government under
Robert Cushman, who inspired her with stories of lawyers standing up
for the First Amendment during the McCarthy era.
   “It was also at Cornell on a blind date in 1950 that she met Martin
Ginsburg. The Justice liked to say that Marty was the frst boy I ever
dated who cared I had a brain.
   “What followed was a marriage for the ages, one that modeled for
the world her vision of gender equality. The Ginsburgs moved to Okla-
homa, where Marty served in the Army and the couple welcomed a
daughter, Jane. In 1956, the couple moved to Cambridge for Marty to
continue and the Justice to begin studies at Harvard Law School.
   “One of nine women in a class of over 500, Justice Ginsburg earned
top grades and was selected for the Harvard Law Review. During her
second year, Marty was diagnosed with cancer. With her superhuman
work ethic, the Justice managed to support Marty, care for Jane, keep
up her own studies, and coordinate Marty's classmates to take notes
for him, which she typed every night.
   “After Marty recovered, the Ginsburgs moved to New York for his
new job. Justice Ginsburg transferred to Columbia Law School and
graduated tied for frst in her class, but she struggled to fnd a job
because, as she recounted, she had three strikes against her: She was
a woman, a mother, and Jewish.
   “Her mentor, Professor Gerald Gunther, fnally secured her a clerk-
ship by promising to provide a male replacement should Justice Gins-
burg not work out. Judge Edmund Palmieri later referred to the Jus-
tice as one of his all-time best clerks.
   “In 1963, Justice Ginsburg joined the Rutgers faculty. She was paid
less than her male counterparts because, as the dean explained, she
had a husband with a good job. Teaching on a year-to-year contract,
Justice Ginsburg hid her pregnancy with her son, James, until she had
the next year's contract in hand.
   “In 1972, Columbia hired Justice Ginsburg to become its frst tenured
female faculty member. That same year, the Justice helped found the
ACLU's Women's Rights Project. As head of the project, she argued
six gender discrimination cases in this Court.
   “In the frst, she represented an Air Force offcer challenging the
military's policy of automatically providing certain benefts to military
wives but not husbands. Her argument was a master class, and her
client prevailed 8-1.
                          FRIDAY, MARCH 17, 2023                     419
   “Throughout the '70s, Justice Ginsburg successfully litigated cases
promoting gender equality, ranging from the routine exemption of
women from jury pools to the denial of Social Security benefts to male
surviving spouses.
   “In 1980, President Carter nominated Justice Ginsburg to the D. C.
Circuit, and in 1993, President Clinton nominated her to this Court.
   “At her confrmation hearing, the Justice proudly introduced herself
as the child of immigrants. She refected, `What has become of me could
happen only in America. Like so many others, I owe so much to the
entry this nation afforded to people yearning to breathe free.' The Sen-
ate confrmed her by a vote of 96-3.
   “Over the next 27 years, Justice Ginsburg left an indelible mark on
the law in countless ways, too many to list here. Central to her legacy
are the opinions in which she championed the idea that all persons
should be afforded what she called equal citizenship stature under
the Constitution.
   “For example, in her landmark opinion for the Court in United States
v. Virginia, she wrote that the Constitution prohibits relying on gener-
alizations to deny any person equal opportunity to aspire, achieve, par-
ticipate in, and contribute to society based on their individual talents
and capacities.
   “She consistently voted to bolster the democratic process, defending,
in her words, the core principle that voters should choose their repre-
sentatives, not the other way around.
   “She urged the Court to reckon with real-world power dynamics,
vividly describing a humiliating strip search of a 13-year-old schoolgirl.
And she served as the Court's resident expert on matters of procedure,
emphasizing systemic integrity, fair access to the courts, and the need
for judicial redress for government wrongdoing, with fairness always
as the cornerstone.
   “Justice Ginsburg was a lifelong optimist. Some of that optimism
stemmed from her belief that people of different ideological views could
share the same faith in the Constitution and this Court's role in safe-
guarding its principles.
   “Her famous friendship with Justice Scalia is a perfect example. She
embraced their shared reverence for the Constitution and this Court.
   “Justice Ginsburg will be remembered as one of our country's great
heroes. Her commitment to truth, justice, and equality changed the
course of American history and inspired millions across the world.
   “Those of us who were lucky enough to know the Justice will remem-
ber her brilliance, her love for Marty and her family, her quiet humor,
420                       FRIDAY, MARCH 17, 2023

her unparalleled work ethic, her tireless attention to getting every
detail just right, her courage in battling cancer, her great love of this
country, and, above all, her abiding goodness.
   “And I will remember the extraordinary year I spent as a law clerk
in her Chambers witnessing up close her grace, her devotion to the
law, and her unyielding spirit.
   “Gathered here together looking back at her life, the members of the
Bar of the Supreme Court express our admiration and respect for the
late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, our loss upon her death, our appreci-
ation for her contributions to the law and the nation, and our gratitude
for her example of a life well lived.
   “On behalf of the Supreme Court Bar, it is my privilege to present
to the Court the resolutions adopted today so that the Attorney Gen-
eral may move their inscription on the Court's permanent record.”
   The Chief Justice said:
   “Thank you, General Prelogar. The Court recognizes the Attorney
General of the United States.”
   The Attorney General said:
   “Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
   “The Bar of the Court met today to honor the life and legacy of Ruth
Bader Ginsburg, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court from 1993
to 2020.
   “Justice Ginsburg was brilliant, courageous, and principled. She be-
lieved deeply in the capacity of the law to fulfll our country's funda-
mental promise of equality.
   “And she believed deeply in our Constitution. As she wrote in her
opinion for the Court in United States v. Virginia, she believed in its
story of the extension of constitutional rights and protections to people
once ignored or excluded.
   “I frst caught a glimpse of Ruth Bader Ginsburg in this courtroom
in 1978 when she came here to argue Duren v. Missouri. The Court's
law clerks were crowded into the wings of the courtroom to hear her.
Our Justices had told us that she was the best advocate we would hear
that term, and she did not disappoint. She won the case 8-1.
   “As it turned out, that would be the last argument she made before
the Court. Two years later, she was appointed to the D. C. Circuit, and
13 years after that, she was appointed to the Supreme Court.
   “But it had been an amazing run as a litigator. Like Thurgood Mar-
shall on behalf of equal rights for black Americans, Ruth Bader Gins-
burg was a chief tactician in the campaign for equal rights for women.
Beginning in 1971, she fled more than 20 Supreme Court briefs chal-
                          FRIDAY, MARCH 17, 2023                   421
lenging legislative distinctions between the sexes, including distinc-
tions that disadvantaged men, in order to establish the principle of
equal treatment. She argued six cases before this Court, losing only
one.
   “Just to describe some of those cases is to recall how different the
world was then. In Duren, the Court struck down a Missouri law that
made jury duty optional for women, and only for women. In Weinberger
v. Wiesenfeld, the Court struck down a provision that permitted a
deceased man's Social Security benefts to be paid to his widow, but
did not permit a deceased woman's benefts to be paid to her widower.
And in one of the frst cases she argued and she briefed, Reed v. Reed,
the Court unanimously struck down a state probate statute that said
`males must be preferred to females' in appointing estate
administrators.
   “But if we think the 1970s were different, you should hear just a
snippet of Justice Ginsburg's own description of what it was like in
1956 when she was one of only nine women in a Harvard Law School
class of more than 500. `Women were not admitted to faculty club din-
ing tables. One could invite one's father but not one's wife or mother
to the Law Review banquet. And the old periodical room at Lamont
Library was closed to women.'
   “In 1958, the Justice's husband, Marty, whom all of us who knew him
loved, graduated from Harvard a year ahead of the Justice and received
a job offer in New York. Justice Ginsburg asked the then dean to let
her fnish the requirements for her Harvard degree at Columbia. Fa-
mously, and to Harvard's everlasting regret, the dean denied her re-
quest. So the Justice transferred to Columbia anyway, served as an
editor for the Law Review, and tied for frst in her class.
   “But, in those days, even that was not enough. A Supreme Court
Justice turned her down for a clerkship, telling the dean of the Colum-
bia Law School that he `just wasn't ready to hire a woman.' Nor could
she fnd a job in a corporate law frm. But as the Justice noted in 2009,
that wasn't all bad. If she had gotten the job, she said, she would have
been a retired law frm partner instead of a Justice of the Supreme
Court of the United States.
   “I do not need to tell anyone in this room how different the world
would have been had that happened. During the Justice's 27 years on
the Court, she infuenced every area of the law, from issues that made
the headlines, like equal justice for women, to highly complex questions
of civil procedure without which our court system could not function.
422                       FRIDAY, MARCH 17, 2023

   “Everyone knows what an intellectual force she was on the Court.
Every lawyer who appeared before her knows how incisive her ques-
tioning was at oral argument, and everyone who reads her concise and
elegant opinions can see her commitment to, in her own words, get it
right and keep it tight.
   “Justice Ginsburg was not only one of the country's brightest legal
minds, she was also a beacon of civility and collegiality. She revered
the role of the federal judiciary and this Court in particular in uphold-
ing the rule of law.
   “She understood the necessity of an independent judiciary to our
democracy. Essential to the rule of law in any land, she said, is an
independent judiciary: judges not under the thumb of other branches
of government, and therefore equipped to administer the law impar-
tially. She strived to be that kind of judge, and she succeeded.
   “Justice Ginsburg was also an enormously caring person. In her per-
sonal life, she supported Marty during his battle with cancer, and then
fought her own. And in her professional life, she was an extraordinary
mentor to her law clerks. Justice Ginsburg's impact on this Court and
on our country will be felt for generations to come. She is and always
will be deeply missed.
   “May her memory be a blessing.
   “Mr. Chief Justice, on behalf of the lawyers of this nation and, in
particular, the members of this Court's Bar, I respectively request that
the resolutions presented to you in honor of Ruth Bader Ginsburg be
accepted by the Court and that, together with the chronicle of these
proceedings, they be ordered kept for all time in the records of this
Court.”
  The Chief Justice said:
  “Your motion is granted, and the resolutions and chronicle will be
made part of the permanent record of the Court.
  “Thank you, General Garland and General Prelogar, for your presen-
tations in memory of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
  “We also extend our appreciation to Judge John Owens and Amanda
Tyler and members of the Committee on Resolutions and to Co-Chairs
Judge Paul Watford and Hajin Kim and members of the Arrange-
ments Committee.
  “This Court's tradition of a Bar memorial dates back nearly two
centuries to Chief Justice John Marshall's passing in 1835. Today is the
frst time a woman serving as Solicitor General of the United States, a
former law clerk to Justice Ginsburg no less, is presenting memorial
resolutions to the Court. Today is the frst time that four seats on the
                          FRIDAY, MARCH 17, 2023                   423
bench are held by women as we receive those resolutions. As far as
tributes to Justice Ginsburg go, these facts are a good place to start.
   “Although this memorial tradition runs to Chief Justice John Mar-
shall, a Bar memorial for Justice Ginsburg harkens back in other ways
to the one held in this building for Justice Thurgood Marshall 30 years
ago. Perhaps in a league with him and no one else, Ruth Bader Gins-
burg had already used the law to change our country profoundly for
the better as an advocate prior to becoming a member of this Court.
   “The Solicitor General mentioned Justice Ginsburg's frst appearance
at the lectern was 50 years ago in Frontiero v. Richardson. Her 10-
minute amicus allotment was uninterrupted by the Justices, maybe
because her dear friend, Antonin Scalia, was some years from joining
the Court.
   “Instead of a lawyer appearing before this Court and others, Justice
Ginsburg might have preferred a career as an opera star. When asked,
she did not disavow such an interest, simply noting that there was the
catch that she could not sing.
   “So she instead served as the impresaria of the Court's musicales, a
tradition she presided over beginning in 2002, attracting renowned art-
ists to perform in the East Conference Room, giving us all respite and
helping to bring us together.
   “But this courtroom was her stage. In the six cases she argued here,
of which she won fve, she articulated an enduring vision of the equality
of women and men as a constitutional principle.
   “In 1980, she was appointed to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the
D. C. Circuit. She wrote more than 700 opinions as a circuit judge,
earning a reputation as a careful, prudent jurist.
   “In 1993, President William Clinton appointed then Judge Ginsburg
to be the 107th member of this Court. The transition was seamless.
Justice Ginsburg's frst opinion of the Court issued on December 13,
1993, a mere two months and one day after argument in a complicated
retirement benefts case. She earned her reputation for speed straight
out of the gate.
   “In the October Term 2007, Justice Ginsburg and I tied, each of us
releasing an opinion on December 4. Coming off the bench, I made sure
Ruth recognized that fact. But she shook her said and said no. Under
our usual protocol, she pointed out, she had announced her opinion from
the bench frst. So she remained the champion.
   “Justice Ginsburg was rightly proud that she never slowed down and
never sacrifced precision, clarity, or technical excellence. She was our
424                       FRIDAY, MARCH 17, 2023

resident expert in civil procedure and federal courts, which was just
fne with the rest of us.
  “Justice Ginsburg's encyclopedic knowledge of all things opera was
not matched with much familiarity concerning more plebeian pastimes.
At one musicale, we surprised her by having her meet Cal Ripken, the
Iron Woman meets the Iron Man, two courageous leaders who worked
through any challenge without missing a step. The audience thought it
was great. The point was, I think, lost on the Justice, who did, however,
fnd it interesting that Ripken was married to a Maryland state judge.
  “Now, to be fair, I'm sure the Justice was surprised, if not shocked,
that I did not recognize many of the opera stars she would discuss
at lunch.
  “Justice Ginsburg inspired artists and young women around the
world, to be sure, but Justices and lawyers in our system as well. That
aspect of her infuence was purposeful, guided by a belief that the ad-
versarial court system operates in service of the rule of law that helps
people who disagree to live together.
  “Fight for the things that you care about, she would say, but do it in
a way that will lead others to join you. Her voice was soft, and the
cadence of her speech was measured. You had to listen to her carefully,
which I think was the point.
  “Justice Ginsburg and her remarkable husband, Martin Ginsburg,
enlivened the Court's family. He was not only a distinguished George-
town law professor and outstanding conversationalist but also a master
baker who sent cakes for her colleagues' birthdays.
  “She would craft direct, effcient written greetings, such as `It's your
birthday, so Marty baked a cake.'
  “Now, as time wore on, Justice Ginsburg somehow developed a new
public persona, the Notorious RBG, a rock star, a cultural icon. Little
girls started showing up on Halloween dressed as RBG. It was an easy
costume: any kind of black robe, black-rimmed glasses, and a white
jabot or other style of collar. RBG products fooded the market. My
favorite was a small candy tin with Ruth's picture on it beneath the
word `Judge Mints.'
  “Now, to be clear, Ruth absolutely loved every minute of it.
  “On the bench, she was often in dissent, but it would be a mistake
to think of her as anything other than relentlessly optimistic in the
long run.
  “She happily cited our nation's motto, E pluribus unum, out of many,
one. It is the main aspiration, she would say. It was her hope for our
country and our world.
                          FRIDAY, MARCH 17, 2023                    425
  “Asked just a few years before her passing how she would like to be
remembered, she said, someone who used whatever talent she had to
do her work to the very best of her ability and to help repair tears in
our society to make things a little better through the use of whatever
ability she has.
  “Justice Ginsburg was a woman of conviction, courage, and quiet
compassion. Small in stature, she stands as a giant in the history of
this Court. Soft in speech, her voice will ring out from the pages of the
U. S. Reports for generations to come.”
  Adjourned until Monday, March 20, 2023 at 10 o'clock.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

  Present: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Thomas, Justice Alito, Justice
Sotomayor, Justice Kagan, Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, Justice
Barrett, and Justice Jackson.
  The Chief Justice said:
  “Before we commence this morning's business, I would like to ac-
knowledge the presence in the courtroom of Justice Stephen G. Breyer,
and I would like to read into the records of the Court an exchange of
correspondence. The frst letter is dated today, May 18, 2023.
   “It is to Justice Breyer from my colleagues and me, and it reads
as follows:
   “Dear Stephen,
   “You are in so many ways a model jurist: learned in the law, open-
minded and fair, at once scholarly and accessible. To us, your col-
leagues, you are the exemplar of judging with joy, humility, and grati-
tude. Throughout 28 years hearing cases on this Court, you brought
both intellectual force and practical sense to deliberations and deci-
sions. You also brought warmth, good humor, and steady friendship to
the Conference. Our work was made better and happier for having
been side by side with you.
   “We have missed your daily presence at the Court in this frst Term
since your retirement, but we take comfort whenever we fnd you in
Chambers and at lunch with us. You remain our resident polymath.
Your broad learning and curiosity, in any number of languages, con-
tinue to inspire every one of us. A simple joke in your telling lifts us
all, albeit often with groaning.
   “Always a professor, it is ftting that you have returned to teaching
at Harvard. Always an ambassador, it is ftting that you continue to
promote the rule of law by engaging others around the world. Always
a devoted spouse, parent, and grandparent, it is ftting that you have
new time for family. Always a judge, it is ftting that you remain a beau
idéal in our common calling and in a lifetime of public service.
   “We wish you and Joanna great happiness in this new chapter.
   “I would now like to read a letter, also dated today, written by Jus-
tice Breyer.”
  “It reads:
  “Dear Colleagues,
570                      THURSDAY, MAY 18, 2023

  “Thank you for your kind letter. I will appreciate and treasure it,
and far more than that, I will long treasure the opportunity I have had
to work with each of you and with former colleagues, as judges, and
particularly as friends, over many years.
  “When I frst joined the Court, Harry Blackmun told me that I would
fnd it an `unusual assignment.' He was right; the work is diffcult; it
requires full attention. It is a huge responsibility, as well as a great
honor. But most of all, one learns that, even when judges disagree
strongly about their work, they can, and do, remain personal friends.
They continue to value each other highly as human beings.
  “That friendship and goodwill has sustained me over the years, from
the beginning and as new colleagues joined. I want you to know that I
am grateful for it and for the opportunity to have worked together
with you. I shall continue to visit the Court from time to time and look
forward to seeing you when I do.
  “With gratitude and affection, Stephen.”
