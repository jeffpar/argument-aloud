SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Present: Mr. Chief Justice Burger, Mr. Justice Brennan, Mr. Justice
Stewart, Mr. Justice White, Mr. Justice Marshall, Mr. Justice Black-
mun, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, and Mr. Justice Stevens.
The Chief Justice said:
"It is my sad duty to announce that our friend and colleague Wil-
liam O. Douglas died Saturday, January 19, 1980.
"For five years, since he suffered a severe stroke on New Year's Eve
of 1974, Justice Douglas' courage and determination exemplified a
quality that characterized his entire life. All of us who knew him
well, and thousands who had no personal acquaintance with him,
shared an admiration for his brave struggle to regain health and
strength.
"His retirement in November 1975 came after the longest tenure in
the history of this Court. When he achieved this record in October
1973, we took note from this Bench of his extraordinary career, his
devotion to freedom, his concern for our environment, his involve-
ment in countless causes relating to the improvement of the human
condition.
"Justice Douglas' public and judicial career spanned more than four
decades of massive social, political and economic changes in our coun-
try, and upheavals in the established order all over the world. Those
changes had large impact on the kinds of issues coming before this
Court. His mark on this crucial period in our history is a very sig-
nificant one. His judicial opinions appear in nearly one fourth of the
more than 440 volumes of the United States Reports.
"I last saw Justice Douglas within the hour before he returned to
the hospital and at that time I could see no lessening of that firm,
even fierce, determination he showed in every contest in his life. He
fought to the very end as he had always done.
"We mourn his passing but we will not forget the comradeship and
friendship that overshadowed the inescapable differences on the vex-
ing issues that historically confront this Court.
"In due course a memorial service of the Bar will be held in this
Chamber to more fully pay our respects, and those of the Supreme
Court Bar, to Mr. Justice Douglas."
The Chief Justice said:
"Today's orders of the Court have been certified by the Chief Jus-
tice, filed with the Clerk, and will not be announced orally."

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Present: Mr. Chief Justice Burger, Mr. Justice Brennan, Mr. Jus-
tice Stewart, Mr. Justice White, Mr. Justice Marshall, Mr. Justice
Blackmun, Mr. Justice Powell, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, and Mr. Justice
Stevens.
The Chief Justice said:
"Before we proceed today with the regular business of the Court,
it is our sad duty to take note of the death of our beloved colleague
and friend Mr. Justice Stanley Reed.
"He served as a Justice of this Court from 1938 to 1957, after having
served as Solicitor General of the United States from 1935 to 1938.
"His death came almost 22 years after retiring from this Court, but
retirement for Justice Reed was not the end, but a continuation of his
judicial career.
"At his own request, he was assigned to sit on United States Courts
of Appeals throughout the United States, and particularly on the
United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
I shared the pleasant and valuable experience of sitting with him on
many cases on that Court, so I found firsthand what his colleagues of
this Court knew: that Justice Reed was a thoughtful, painstaking, able
jurist, dedicated to the American system and the Constitution. His 19
years in this Court spanned one of the most stirring periods of the
country's history and the Court's history. But whether in agreement
or dissent in cases of great importance, Mr. Justice Reed was the epi-
tome of civility.
"His career as lawyer in government was unusual, to say the least.
He was successively General Counsel of the Federal Farm Board,
General Counsel of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, and Solic-
itor General of the United States before his appointment to this Court
by President Roosevelt. He lived a rich and full life in every respect.
"I speak for all the members of this Court in expressing our pro-
found sympathy to Mrs. Reed and to her family, the two sons of Mr.
Justice Reed and Mrs. Reed.
"On an appropriate occasion after the opening of the next Term of
this Court in October, the official memorial service of the Bar will be
conducted for Mr. Justice Reed in this Chamber."
The Chief Justice said:
"Today's orders of the Court have been certified by the Chief Justice,
filed with the Clerk, and will not be announced orally."
