If your honors please, it is my sad duty to convey to the court the

occurred at his home in Indianapolis yesterday. He was President of
the United States from 1889 to 1893, and most distinguished as a citizen
and a statesman, as a soldier, and a practitioner at the bar of this court.
Out of respect to his memory I move that the court now adjourn until
to-morrow.
The Chief Justice responded:
The court fully shares in the national sorrow, and sympathizes with
the suggestion which has just been made.
The great services to his country rendered by this distinguished soldier,
statesman, and citizen; the exalted offices so worthily filled by him; his
conceded eminence at this bar; his private virtues; make recognition of
the loss sustained in his death involuntary and universal.
