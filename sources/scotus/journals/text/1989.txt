Adjourned until this afternoon at 4 o'clock.
The Chief Justice said:
"The Court is convened today in special session to commemorate the
200th anniversary of its first sitting. We have the privilege of having
three distinguished speakers here today to take note of this event. We
begin with the former Chief Justice Burger."
CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER: “In a matter of days it will be 200
years since this Court first undertook to meet. On the day set, only
three of the six Justices who had been confirmed were present. There
being no quorum they met the following day when the fourth Justice
arrived. The fifth did not make it at all and the sixth, Justice Harrison,
declined the appointment partly on the grounds of health and probably
influenced by the reality that riding circuit, with the primitive condi-
tions of travel in that day, was a burden that only a Justice in robust
health could undertake.
As we know, this first session was held in a small room on the second
floor of a commercial building in New York City across the street from
the Fulton Fish Market near the waterfront. A bronze plaque was
placed at this site by the American Bar Association in 1976.
Although the subject of Article III was extensively discussed at
Philadelphia and in the ratification conventions, it did not receive the
close attention, in some respects, that the other parts of the Constitu-
tion were given by the Committee on Style, where it might well have
noticed that there was no reference to "Justices" in Article III but sim-
ply “judges.” That was not consistent with the reference to the Office of
Chief Justice in Article I assigning the duty to preside over impeach-
ment trials. The Judiciary Act of 1789, largely drafted by Senator
Oliver Ellsworth, who would become the third Chief Justice, the office
is described as "Chief Justice of the United States."
The structure of the federal system included a court of appeals to re-
view the district courts, but it provided no judgeships for that court. It
provided that those courts for each of the three circuits be made up of
two Supreme Court Justices and one District Judge. Within a few
years, the requirement of two Justices was reduced to one, but this

344
TUESDAY, JANUARY 16, 1990
required Justices to ride circuit under great hardships of primitive
travel and housing. In 1791, Chief Justice Jay urged that judgeships be
provided for the courts of appeals and the Congress did so in 1800 but
then reversed itself after the election of Thomas Jefferson and the new
Congress repealed the Act in 1801. In that day there seemed to be an
attitude in the Congress that if the Justices of the Supreme Court were
kept busy riding circuit they would be less troublesome to the other
branches of government. The history of that early period shows that in
a good many instances judges of the state courts declined appointments
to the Supreme Court largely because of the circuit riding burden. John
Marshall had declined appointment several years before becoming
Chief Justice.
Congress finally did respond to the urgings of Chief Justice Jay and his
successors by providing judges for the Court of Appeals and eliminating
circuit riding burdens, but that was done, to borrow a phrase from the
English equity law, "with all deliberate speed." It was done in 1891.
There being no business before the Court in the first few sessions it
undertook house keeping matters; it appointed a "cryer," adopted a seal
for the Court and later appointed a clerk. At its second session it admit-
ted some lawyers, and over the next two years it mainly waited for the
pipeline to bring some cases from the lower courts.
In the Court's first ten years there are less than 70 cases reported in
the U. S. Reports of that day. I suspect that members of the Court
would like the docket to move in that direction-but without circuit
riding.
The precise number of cases and opinions of the Court is not clear
because apparently officers of the Court and those compiling the Re-
ports may have decided that a record of some cases were not worth pre-
serving. The records of those early years were not carefully kept and,
of those that were kept, some were lost as the Court moved from New
York to Philadelphia and then to Washington, and also some were de-
stroyed probably by the British when they occupied Washington in the
War of 1812. About 15 years ago the Court and the Historical Society
joined in a project to reconstitute those records.
But it would be a mistake to assume that no important cases were
decided in that first decade of the Court's history. Often overlooked,
but possibly one of the most important, was the case of Ware v. Hylton
argued in 1796 while the Court was sitting in Philadelphia, the only case
John Marshall ever argued in this Court. The records indicate that the
argument lasted about six days. Ware v. Hylton is important because it
can be read as foreshadowing the holding in Marbury v. Madison nine

345
years later. The Court held, as we know, that a treaty between the
United States and England terminating the war and requiring the pay-
ment of debts owed by Americans to British creditors be paid not in
state currency but in the equivalent of "gold."
John Marshall lost the case in a unanimous holding of the Court with
Justice Samuel Chase writing the lead opinion and the other Justices,
writing separately, following the English custom.
As a judge I think Marshall would have decided Ware v. Hylton as
the Court did. The best argument he could make was that the 1783
treaty did not apply and control the state legislative act because the
debts were incurred before the Revolutionary War and before the Con-
stitution. In holding that under Article VI, the treaty prevailed over a
legislative act, surely gave some hint of Marbury, but the opinion in
Marbury v. Madison does not cite Ware v. Hylton. Whether that was
because he wanted to forget about losing the case we have no way of
knowing, but surely that great mind of his must have had in mind that if
one clause of the Constitution controls over a legislative act the result
in Marbury v. Madison was quite simple.
The young Supreme Court did not enjoy the prestige that it has
today. It was not regarded as a co-equal branch, and some questioned
whether it could survive. Even Chief Justice Jay, one of the greats
among our founding fathers, did not see much of a future for the Court.
He resigned after about six years to become governor of New York.
After Adams was defeated in the election of 1800 and Chief Justice Ells-
worth resigned on the basis of health, Adams then offered the appoint-
ment to Jay. In declining he wrote that he would rather be governor of
New York and, in any event, the Supreme Court as a tribunal would
never amount to very much.
It was then that John Adams, the lame duck President, turned to his
Secretary of State, John Marshall, and invited him to take the appoint-
ment. Although Marshall had previously declined an appointment to
this Court he did accept and the year of 1801 began a great epoch in the
history of this Court and of this country.
As we take note of this important anniversary of this Court - and of
the county-it comes at the close of the decade when people all over the
world are demanding the kinds of freedom this Court has been foremost
in protecting for 200 years. Our history is their hope, and our hope for
them must be that whatever systems they set up in place of the tyranny
they have rejected will include a judiciary with authority and independ-
ence to enforce the basic guarantees of freedom, as this Court has done
for these two hundred years."

CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
Mr. Rex Lee.
MR. LEE: "Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I am hon-
ored to participate in this bicentennial commemoration, and specifically
to make some comments concerning the work of the Supreme Court bar
over the 200 years of the Court's history.
The clerk's familiar incantation, swearing new members of the bar as
"attorneys and counselors" is rooted in some interesting history. Origi-
nally, there was a distinction between the two. The first rules of the
Court, adopted on Thursday, February 5, 1790, provided that “counsel-
lors shall not practice as attornies nor attornies as counsellors in this
court." Historians tell us the difference was that attorneys could file
motions and do other paperwork, but only counselors could "plead a
case before the Court." 1 The distinction lasted for eleven and one-half
years, until by rule adopted on August 12, 1801, the Court ordered
"that Counsellors may be admitted as Attornies in this Court, on taking
the usual oath.” 2
Over the two centuries of this Court's existence, there have stood be-
fore this podium- or its equivalent in other parts of this town, in Phila-
delphia and New York-some very able and prominent "attorneys and
counsellors." It is not surprising that appearances before this Court
during its early years were dominated by Attorneys General of the
United States; until the creation of the office of the Solicitor General in
1870, it was the Attorney General who was responsible for representing
the United States before this Court. What is surprising is that the most
notable and most frequent appearances of those early Attorneys Gen-
eral were not on behalf of the government but in representation of pri-
vate clients. This was true of the first Attorney General, Edmund Ran-
dolph, the second, William Bradford, the seventh, William Pinkney,
and the ninth, William Wirt. Indeed, William Wirt, one of the greatest
Supreme Court advocates of all time and the man who holds the record
for years of service as Attorney General, confessed that "my single mo-
tive for accepting the office was the calculation of being able to (obtain)
more money for less work." 3 Things were a little different then.
Edmund Randolph, our first Attorney General, was the most active
of this Court's early practitioners. He appeared as counsel in the very
12 U. S. (2 Dall.) 399 (1790); 1 The Documentary History of the Supreme Court of
the United States, 1789-1800 177, n. 18 (M. Marens & J. Perry eds. 1985).

first case (which came up during the February 1791 term) Van
Staphorst and Van Staphorst v. Maryland. He also argued the first
landmark case, Chisholm v. Georgia. Indeed, he was the only person
who argued in that case. The state of Georgia refused to appear, and at
the conclusion of Randolph's argument which lasted two and one-half
hours, the Court's minutes reflect that "the Court, after remarking on
the importance of the subject now before them . . . . expressed the
wish to hear any gentlemen of the bar who might be disposed to take up
the gauntlet in opposition to the Attorney General. As no gentlemen,
however, were so disposed, the Court held the matter under advise-
ment . . . . . It would appear that the rules governing oral argument
by amici were a bit more liberal in those days.
994
The same is true of divided arguments, time limits, and questions
from the bench. Representing the two sides in the oral argument in
McCulloch v. Maryland was perhaps the greatest collection of promi-
nent advocates in the history of this Court's bar. Arguing for the bank
were William Pinkney, William Wirt and Daniel Webster. And repre-
senting Maryland were Luther Martin, Joseph Hopkinson, and Walter
Jones. The entire argument, by all six counsel, lasted nine days;
Thomas Edison's birth was still twenty-eight years away, and there
were no red nor white lights. Those were the days when there were no
questions; both the commentators and the advocates themselves re-
ferred to their arguments as speeches, which they would rehearse for
days. Charles Warren relates that "the social season of Washington
began with the opening of the Supreme Court term," 5 and some of
those early lawyers, particularly Webster and Pinkney, apparently re-
sponded by paying as much attention to the gallery as to the Justices.
Pinkney's argument alone in McCulloch lasted for three full days. It
was a performance which Professor Warren has said "was to prove the
greatest effort of his life . . . . .” Pinkney was described by Chief Jus-
tice Marshall as "the greatest man (he) had ever seen in a court of
justice"; by Chief Justice Taney as one to whom there was "none equal";
by Justice Story as having "great superiority over every other man
(he had) ever known"; and by Francis Wheaton as the "brightest and
meanest of mankind.” 6

Pinkney had the distinction of serving as Attorney General of both
the United States and also the state of Maryland, as a member of both
Houses of Congress, and minister to Great Britain and Russia. But
whichever of these was paramount, it was in Pinkney's view a distant
second to his one consuming passion: advocate before this Court. It was
an endeavor to which he gave his life, both figuratively and literally.
Following the completion of the last of his eighty-four arguments, in
Ricard v. Williams-in 1822 with Daniel Webster on the other side-
he suffered a collapse. He was carried to his home, where he died a few
days later. Incidentally, he lost Ricard v. Williams, an unpleasant
experience for any lawyer, but one that is well-known to those who are
seasoned.
Walter Jones holds the record number of oral arguments with 317. It
is a record which, given today's realities, is surely safe for all time. For
Mr. Jones, there will be no Roger Maris or Hank Aaron. Daniel Web-
ster is in second place, and it would appear that John W. Davis is third,
and Erwin Griswold fourth. But the record number of landmarks, in my
opinion, belongs to William Wirt, whose biographer has accurately
observed that “he appeared in virtually all of the landmark cases of
the first third of the nineteenth century." These included Dartmouth
College v. Woodward, McCulloch v. Maryland, Cohens v. Virginia,
Gibbons v. Ogden, Brown v. Maryland, Ogden v. Saunders, Worcester
v. Georgia, Cherokee Nation v. Georgia and Charles River Bridge v.
Warren Bridge. Wirt was described by Chief Justice Chase as "one of
the purest and noblest of men" and by another contemporary as "the
most beloved of American advocates." "
8
In four of these landmarks, Dartmouth College, McCulloch, Cohens
v. Virginia, and Gibbons v. Ogden, Wirt appeared with Daniel Web-
ster. They argued Dartmouth College and McCulloch just three weeks
apart. He was the Attorney General at that time, and though in
McCulloch he was arguing to sustain the power of the federal govern-
ment, he received a substantial fee from the Bank of the United
States.10
Daniel Webster, though he won slightly less than half of his cases,
probably had the greatest influence on the Court and its work of any
nineteenth century advocate-perhaps the greatest influence of any ad-

vocate in the Court's history. S. W. Finley has observed that "Webster
and Chief Justice Marshall shared the same basic constitutional philoso-
phy, and together with Justice Joseph Story they constitute a fortu-
itous triumvirate in establishing the fundamentals of American federal-
ism in the first four decades of the nineteenth century." 11
The twentieth century, of course, is not yet complete, but it is
already clear that during the Court's second hundred years, advocates
to match the stature of Pinkney, Wirt, and Webster have stood at this
podium. Comparisons are difficult because of changes in circumstances
and rules, but quite clearly the Court's jurisprudence during this
century has been influenced by people such as John W. Davis, Robert
Jackson, Thurgood Marshall, and Erwin Griswold, just as it was during
earlier times by Pinkney, Wirt, and Webster. And our century also has
had its equivalent of McCulloch's battle of the giants when, for exam-
ple, Briggs v. Elliot, a companion case to Brown v. Board of Educa-
tion, pitted John W. Davis against Thurgood Marshall.
Mr. Chief Justice, we the members of the bar of this Court are proud
of the institution whose two hundredth birthday we celebrate, proud of
what it has meant and what it has done for our country and its people,
and proud of the contribution that the members of the bar have made to
the Court and its accomplishments over its two-hundred-year history.
We recognize that we are more than attorneys and counselors. As offi-
cers of the Court, we are charged not only with the responsibility of
vigorously representing our clients but also assuring that our represen-
tation is objective, fair, evenhanded, and contributory to the Court's
performance of its duties. We are mindful of the institution before
which we practice, and the role that it has played from 1790 to 1990 in
securing individual rights and providing stable government. We are
pleased to offer our continuing services as we enter the Court's third
century."
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: Thank you, Mr. Lee. Mr. Solicitor
General Kenneth W. Starr.
SOLICITOR GENERAL STARR: "Almost half a Century after this
Court's opening session, Alexis de Tocqueville, the French observer of
democracy in the new Republic, turned his eye back to the Founding
and saw in that remarkable generation the finest minds and noblest
characters ever to have graced the New World.

TUESDAY, JANUARY 16, 1990
And the wisest, ablest minds of that generation were well repre-
sented in the membership of this Court. As we have been reminded, the
docket may not have been especially demanding, and the rigors of office
may have been daunting, but the Court nonetheless boasted among its
members not only its distinguished Chief Justice, John Jay, author
along with Madison and Hamilton of The Federalist Papers, but also
several delegates to the Constitutional Convention itself. Like the Na-
tion's first Attorney General, Edmund Randolph of Virginia (whose
successor is here today), Justices Rutledge of South Carolina, Wilson
of Pennsylvania, and Blair of Virginia, had served as members of the
Convention. Other Justices of the 1790's, including Iredell of North
Carolina and Cushing of Massachusetts, had played pivotal roles in
their respective States in securing ratification.
To these individuals, along with their counterparts in the political
branches, fell the task of forming a workable government. It was John
Jay who articulated the basic structural insight:
"Wise and virtuous men have thought and reasoned
very differently respecting Government, but in this
they have at length very unanimously agreed. That its
powers should be divided into three, distinct,
independent Departments - the Executive legislative
and judicial."
As Providence would have it, in our system of separated powers, it
fell in no small measure to the Court to serve as an instrument of
achieving the Madisonian and Hamiltonian vision of a vast commercial
republic. That was not without difficulty, since this was to be the
branch where, as Hamilton put it, judgment, not will, was to be
exercised.
The fundamental importance of the judgment of the judiciary was
made manifest early on. That our constitutional democracy, by virture
of the status of the Constitution as supreme law, would include the
power of judicial review was evidenced in the judicial literature as early
as 1792 in Hayburn's Case. If not before, the decision of Hylton v.
United States in 1796, upholding the constitutionality of the federal
Carriage Tax, powerfully foreshadowed Marbury v. Madison. In short,
although the judiciary was to be the least dangerous branch, it was
nonetheless to be a truly co-equal, co-ordinate branch with the Legisla-
ture and the Executive.
In view of the Court's role, friction between the federal judiciary and
the several States was inevitable, just as leading Anti-Federalists such

TUESDAY, JANUARY 16, 1990

as George Mason had pessimistically predicted. Quite apart from Chis-
holm v. Georgia, other decisions of that first decade now dim in the na-
tional memory made clear that the national power in its proper sphere
extended to and ultimately controlled the States. This was important to
be said, and the Court did not flinch from saying it.
These formative principles-of the legitimacy as well as the limits of
judicial power, and of the need to vindicate the primacy of the Nation in
its appropriate sphere over narrow, parochial interests-provided im-
portant grist for the early judicial mill. Along with Washington's stew-
ardship of the Executive power, and the wisdom of the first Congress.
graced by Madison himself, who turned his hand to fashioning the Bill
of Rights-the leaders of the Nation in all three branches brought to
life in 1789 and 1790 what the Framers had envisioned a balanced gov-
ernment, destined to stand the test of time.
-
The Nation has endured and prospered. The structure of government
has endured. The Court has endured. And with the long-sought aboli-
tion of slavery, the promise of legal equality-embodied in the 14th
Amendment - took root and grew so that the original vision of the Dec-
laration and the Constitution's vision of a more perfect union, preserved
out of bitter conflict, and a true constitutional democracy for all our citi-
zens came fully to life. It was in large measure these events - so impor-
tant for the work of this Court over the past century—that brought the
Department of Justice into being in the wake of the Civil War.
This was what Tocqueville had seen so clearly, peering as he did into
the future, looking at us with prophetic vision. Social equality, as
Tocqueville put it, was what America ultimately promised through the
emergence of democratic institutions. This was, he felt, the will of God.
From the American experience, purified by slavery's inevitable eradi-
cation, Tocqueville believed that Europe could learn and morally profit.
This was a new order of the ages. Out of the mouths of babes in the
New World, truths about what the Twentieth Century moral imagina-
tion of T. S. Eliot would call, simply, the permanent things, would
emerge the moral vision of equal justice under the rule of law. This
was, as demonstrated by events now unfolding across the globe, a pow-
erful vision destined to capture the moral imagination of the entire fam-
ily of mankind.
-
For that vision brought to life in the judiciary's daily, steadfast serv-
ice to the law, those of us privileged to serve in the Department of Jus-
tice, under the stewardship of the officer whose office was created by
the Judiciary Act of 1789, salute the courts of justice and the tribunal
ordained in Article III of our beloved Constitution as "one supreme

Court". As Lincoln put it so simply at Gettysburg, only seven years be-
fore the birth of our own Department, it is entirely fitting and proper
that should we do this."
CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST: "Thank you Mr. Starr. Chief Jus-
tice Burger, General Starr, Mr. Lee: your felicitous remarks have
shown how the Supreme Court of the United States got off to what was
indeed a slow start in New York two hundred years ago, but eventually
picked up the necessary speed to evolve into a truly co-equal branch of
the federal government.
Half a century ago the Court held a ceremony similar to this one,
commemorating the one-hundred and fiftieth anniversary of its first
session. Attorney General Robert H. Jackson-soon himself to become
a member of this Court - addressed the Court on that occasion saying:
"(T) his age is one of founding fathers to those who
follow. Of course, they will reexamine the work of this
day, and some will be rejected. Time will no doubt disclose
that sometimes when our generation thinks it is correcting
a mistake of the past, it is really only substituting one
of its own. . . I see no reason to doubt that the
problems of the next half-century will test the wisdom
and courage of this Court as severely as any half-century
of its existence."
None of us here today can doubt the accuracy of Robert Jackson's as-
sessment of this Court's succeeding half-century. All of us realize how
significantly—indeed, how dramatically-the interpretation of the
United States Constitution has changed in the past fifty years. And
yet, we, too, must realize that our work has no more claim to infallibil-
ity than that of our predecessors. Daniel Webster said that "Justice is
the great end of man on earth”—a statement which attests his wisdom
not only as a statesman but as a theologian - and the motto inscribed
on the front of this building-"Equal Justice Under Law"-describes a
quest, not a destination.
·
But if we look at the temporal context of the ceremony here in this
room fifty years ago, it was vastly different from the one today. The
gathering storm of war had burst a few months earlier with the German
invasion of Poland. A few months later the German breakthrough in the
Ardennens would knock France out of the war, leaving Great Britain
and her commonwealth allies fighting alone against the dictators. The
fate of constitutional ideals such as self-government and the rule of law
seemed to hand in the balance of war.

TUESDAY, JANUARY 16. 1990
353
How different it is today. The allies won the Second World War, and
the worth of western values was re-established. In February, 1940,
when this Court celebrated its one hundred and fiftieth anniversary, it
was virtually the only constitutional court-a court whose existence
was based on a written constitution which had the authority to invali-
date legislative acts-sitting anywhere in the world. But after the Sec-
ond World War, the idea of such a court found favor with nation after
nation.
The written Constitution drafted by the framers in Philadelphia in
1787 incorporated two ideas which were new to the art of government.
The first is the system of presidential government, in which the execu-
tive authority was separated from the legislative authority. This idea
has found little favor outside of the United States, and countries just as
committed to democratic self-government as we are have preferred the
parliamentary system.
The second idea was that of a constitutional court which should have
authority to enforce the provisions of a written constitution. It is this
second idea which has commanded itself to country after country follow-
ing the Second World War. Today its momentum continues. Less than a
decade ago Canada adopted a charter of rights to be enforced by its
Supreme Court. In countries today which do not have a full-scale con-
stitutional court - Great Britain, Sweden, Australia-proponents of
change are engendering lively debate. It do not think that I overstate.
the case when I say that the idea of a constitutional court such as this
one is the most important single American contribution to the art of
government.
As we look today towards eastern Europe, where a curtain which had
been drawn for nearly half of a century has been lifted only with the
past year it may not be too much to hope that these nations, too, will
see fit to re-shape their judiciaries on the American model.
The three Justices who gathered in New York City on February 1,
1790, could not possibly have foreseen the future importance of the
court upon which they accepted the call to serve. I am confident that
even those who gathered here fifty years ago could not have foreseen
the changes and developments in the law which would come in the next
half-century, nor the influence that this institution would have outside
its borders during that time. And surely the same is true of those of us
who have gathered here today to commemorate the bicentennial of the
Court's first sitting.
We have no way of knowing with certainty where the quest for equal
justice under law will lead our successors in the next half-century. If at

354
TUESDAY, JANUARY 16, 1990
times our labors seem commonplace or even unavailing, let us hark to
the words of Arthur Hughe Clough:

"And not by eastern windows only
When daylight comes comes in the light
In front the sun climbs slow, how slowly
But westward look, the land is bright!"

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Present: Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice Brennan, Justice White,
Justice Marshall, Justice Blackmun, Justice O'Connor, and Justice
Scalia.
The Chief Justice said:
"As we open this morning we note with sadness the death last Friday
of Arthur J. Goldberg, former Justice of this Court.
Born of immigrant parents in Chicago, he graduated with honors
from Northwestern Law School when he was only twenty-one. His ca-
reer exemplified a life-long interest in public affairs. During thirty
years of private practice in the middle part of this century, he served as
General Counsel to the CIO, and was instrumental in effecting its
merger with the AFofL in 1955.
When President John F. Kennedy took office in 1961, he chose
Arthur Goldberg to be his Secretary of Labor. Barely a year and a half
later he appointed Justice Goldberg to this Court to succeed Justice
Felix Frankfurter. Justice Goldberg left the Court three years later to
accept appointment from President Lyndon Johnson as the United
States Ambassador to the United Nations. He served in that post dur-
ing a very difficult period of the Vietnam War, and after leaving it
returned to the practice of law.
Though Justice Goldberg served on this Court for a comparatively
brief period of time, he made important contributions to its jurispru-
dence. I speak for all members of the Court in expressing our profound
sympathy to the family of Justice Goldberg. The recess which the Court
takes today will be in memory of Justice Goldberg, and at an appropri-
ate time there will be a traditional memorial observance in this
Courtroom."
