   No. 06–179. Charles R. Riegel, et ux., Petitioners v. Medtronic, Inc.
Motion of Donna Riegel, the administrator of the Estate of Charles R.
Riegel, to be substituted in place of Charles R. Riegel, deceased,
granted. The exercise of this Court’s power to grant an untimely mo­
tion to substitute a party is not unprecedented. State Farm Mutual
Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 537 U. S. 1042 (2002); see also Schact v.
United States, 398 U. S. 58, 63–64 (1970) (“The procedural rules
adopted by the Court for the orderly transaction of its business are
not jurisdictional and can be relaxed by the Court in the exercise of
its discretion . . .”); Stern & Gressman, Supreme Court Practice 350
(8th ed. 2002). The Chief Justice and Justice Scalia would deny the mo­
tion, because it was ﬁled more than six months after the petitioner’s
death. See Supreme Court Rule 35.1 (“If the substitution of a repre­
sentative of the deceased is not made within six months after the death
of the party, the case shall abate” (emphasis added)). The fact that Rule
35.1 is not jurisdictional is not a reason to ignore it, particularly since
here, unlike in Campbell, supra, the motion was opposed by the
respondent.
   No. 06–887. City of Revere, Massachusetts, et al., Petitioners v.
T&D Video, Inc., dba Moonlite Reader. Motion of respondent for attor­
ney’s fees and costs referred to the Appeals Court of Massachusetts

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

   Present: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Stevens, Justice Scalia, Jus­
tice Kennedy, Justice Souter, Justice Thomas, Justice Ginsburg, Justice
Breyer, and Justice Alito.

                       Order in Pending Case
   No. 07A311. Larry Norris, Director, Arkansas Department of Cor­
rections, Applicant v. Jack Harold Jones, Jr. Application to vacate the
stay of execution of sentence of death entered by the United States
Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit on October 11, 2007, presented
to Justice Alito and by him referred to the Court denied. Opinion by
Justice Scalia, dissenting from denial. I vote to grant the State’s appli­
cation to vacate the stay because in my view the decision of the Eighth
Circuit was based on the mistaken premise that our grant of certiorari
in Baze v. Rees, S. Ct. ––– (2007), calls for the stay of every execution
in which an individual raises an Eighth Amendment challenge to the
lethal injection protocol. Grant of certiorari in a single case does not
alter the application of normal rules of procedure, including those re­
lated to timeliness. In this case, Jones’s challenge to the lethal injection
protocol, which was brought nine years after his conviction and sen­
tence became ﬁnal, was dilatory.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

   Present: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Stevens, Justice Scalia, Jus­
tice Kennedy, Justice Souter, Justice Thomas, Justice Ginsburg, Justice
Breyer, and Justice Alito.
  The Chief Justice said:
  “Today’s orders of the Court have been duly entered and certiﬁed,
and ﬁled with the Clerk, and they will not be otherwise announced.”

                Certiorari—Summary Dispositions

   No. 07–5130. Jose Arquimides Ibarra, Petitioner v. United States.
On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals
for the Eighth Circuit. Motion of petitioner for leave to proceed
in forma pauperis and petition for writ of certiorari granted. Judg­
ment vacated, and case remanded to the United States Court of Ap­
peals for the Eighth Circuit for further consideration in light of Rita
v. United States, 551 U. S. ––– (2007).
   No. 07–5473. John L. Heavner, Petitioner v. United States. On peti­
tion for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for
the Eighth Circuit. Motion of petitioner for leave to proceed in forma
pauperis and petition for writ of certiorari granted. Judgment vacated,
and case remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the
Eighth Circuit for further consideration in light of Rita v. United
States, 551 U. S. ––– (2007).
   No. 07–6522. Montgomery Blair Sibley, Petitioner v. Stephen Breyer,
Associate Justice, Supreme Court of the United States, et al. On peti­
tion for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit. Because the Court lacks a quorum, 28
U. S. C. § 1, and since a majority of the qualiﬁed Justices are of the
opinion that the case cannot be heard and determined at the next Term
of the Court, the judgment is afﬁrmed under 28 U. S. C. § 2109, which
provides that under these circumstances the Court shall enter its order
afﬁrming the judgment of the court from which the case was brought
for review with the same effect as upon afﬁrmance by an equally di­
vided Court. Justice Stevens, Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, Justice
Souter, Justice Thomas, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer took no
part in the consideration or decision of this petition.
