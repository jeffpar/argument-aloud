  No. 06–5618. Mario Claiborne, Petitioner v. United States. Motion
of petitioner for leave to proceed in forma pauperis granted. Petition
for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the

tutes a substantial variance from the Guidelines be justified by extraor-
dinary circumstances?.
  No. 06–5754. Victor A. Rita, Petitioner v. United States. Motion of
petitioner for leave to proceed in forma pauperis granted. Petition for
writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth
Circuit granted limited to the following Questions: 1) Was the district
court’s choice of within-Guidelines sentence reasonable? 2) In making
that determination, is it consistent with United States v. Booker, 543
U. S. 220 (2005), to accord a presumption of reasonableness to within-
Guidelines sentences? 3) If so, can that presumption justify a sentence
imposed without an explicit analysis by the district court of the 18
U. S. C. § 3553(a) factors and any other factors that might justify a
lesser sentence?
