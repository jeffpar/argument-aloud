No. In Re: Holmes Hall:
-
It appearing that Holmes Hall, of Richmond, Virginia, a member
of the Bar of this Court, was appointed Special Master in the case
of Universal Oil Products Company v. Standard Oil Company
(Indiana), a cause then pending in the United States District Court
for the Western District of Missouri;
And it further appearing that on appeal to the United States
Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit from an order
allowing additional compensation to said Holmes Hall, as Special
Master, the order was reversed and the said Holmes Hall was re-
quired to pay into court for the benefit of the litigants the sum of
$44,700 with interest thereon from October 18, 1924; and that the
Circuit Court of Appeals in its opinion on said appeal under date
of March 9, 1935 (Universal Oil Products Co. v. Hall, 76 F. (2d)
258), stated as follows:
"Mr. Hall failed to comport himself with reserve and dignity, and
he also disqualified himself as Master by trying to get some patent
privilege for himself in the patent field involved in the case before
him. Both shortcomings were possibly attributable to inexperience

MONDAY, OCTOBER 14, 1935
10
and failure to appreciate the obligations of his office. But it is per-
fectly clear, on the whole evidence, that he betrayed his trust by
attempting to deceive, intimidate, and coerce a wealthy litigant before
him, with the corrupt motive of gaining for himself an enormous sum
of money without earning it. The expressions used by his friend
Senator Patterson, by his own witness, Mr. German, by the lawyer,
Mr. Reichmann, who wanted to help him if there was any excuse for
him, and by the trial court, when Mr. Hall's correspondence was laid
before them-' an appalling thing', 'deplorable situation', ' a serious
offense', ' perfectly horrible', 'the correspondence itself shows such
a state of mind on the part of the Master that no report he could
make could conceivably be of any value to the Court '—these expres-
sions reflect the natural reaction of honest men to Mr. Hall's conduct,
and there is no need to amplify.
66 Mr. Hall's powers as Master in Chancery to make findings of
fact and conclusions of law were withdrawn because of his miscon-
duct. In consequence, and solely on account of that misconduct,
great sums of money which had been paid to Mr. Hall on account
of his alleged study of the testimony and the law, beginning almost
immediately after the taking of testimony started, were utterly
wasted, and all advantage of the expenditures were lost to the liti-
gants who paid the money. There is no possible ground upon which
the court could be justified in permitting him to keep the money paid
to him by the litigants for the wasted service.";
It is ordered that a rule issue, returnable within forty days, re-
quiring said Holmes Hall to show cause why he should not be dis-
barred from further practice of the law in this Court for conduct
unbecoming a member of the bar of this Court.

No. In the Matter of James L. Minnis. On considering the
brief filed on October 21, 1935, by James L. Minnis, of San Fran-
cisco, California, a member of the Bar of this Court, in the case of
A-I Garage v. Lange Investment Company, No. 489, of the October
Term, 1935, and in particular the following statements on pages
four and five thereof:
"Petitioner's claim is not that the judges committed errors on a
trial, but that they wilfully denied it a trial; not that they committed
error in interpreting the lease or the law, but that they wilfully
substituted for the lease fictions as affirmative facts, and for the law
a fiction precisely the opposite of the law; not that the judges failed
to deliberate, but that they did deliberate; not that they were exposed
to temptation, but that they sought temptation and decided the case
for two despicable purposes: one, to give petitioner's money to re-
spondent; the other, to enable pawnbrokers, lessors, and payees in
innumerable installment purchase contracts of automobiles, baby
buggies, electric refrigerators, household goods, musical instruments,
radios, sewing machines, vacuum cleaners, washing machines, and a
thousand other articles, to garner a harvest of penalties, which was
approved by the judges of the state supreme court.” ';

quiring said James L. Minnis to show cause why he should not be
disbarred from further practice of the law in this Court for conduct
unbecoming a member of the Bar of this Court.

the practice of the law in this Court for conduct unbecoming a
member of the Bar of this Court in filing a brief in this Court, on
October 21, 1935, in the case of A-1 Garage v. Lange Investment
Company, No. 489 of the October Term, 1935, which brief contained
in particular the following statements on pages four to five thereof:
"Petitioner's claim is not that the judges committed errors on
a trial, but that they willfully denied it a trial; not that they com-
mitted error in interpreting the lease or the law, but that they
willfully substituted for the lease fictions as affirmative facts, and
for the law a fiction precisely the opposite of the law; not that the
judges failed to deliberate, but that they did deliberate; not that
they were exposed to temptation, but that they sought temptation
and decided the case for two despicable purposes; one, to give peti-
tioner's money to respondent; the other, to enable pawnbrokers,
lessors, and payees in innumerable installment purchase contracts
of automobiles, baby buggies, electric refrigerators, household goods,
musical instruments, radios, sewing machines, vacuum cleaners,
washing machines, and a thousand other articles, to garner a harvest
of penalties, which was approved by the judges of the state supreme
court.";
a rule having issued and respondent having made return thereto,
acknowledging his mistake, expressing his regret, disclaiming any
intent to reflect upon the judges to whom reference is made in said
statements, and completely apologizing therefor;
It is ordered by this Court (1) that the offensive statements be,
and they are hereby, stricken from the files of this Court; (2) that
the apology of respondent be accepted and that the rule be, and it is
hereby, discharged.

ORDER
169
It is ordered by this Court that paragraph 1 of Rule 12 of the
Rules of this Court, be amended so as to read as follows:
"1. Upon the presentation of a petition for the allowance of an
appeal to this court, from any court, to any judge or justice em-
powered by law to allow it, there shall be presented by the applicant
a separate typewritten statement particularly disclosing the basis
upon which it is contended that this court has jurisdiction upon
appeal to review the judgment or decree in question. The state-
ment shall refer distinctly (a) to the statutory provision believed
to sustain the jurisdiction; (b) to the statute of the state, or statute
or treaty of the United States, the validity of which is involved (giv-
ing the volume and page where the statute or treaty may be found in
the official edition), setting it out verbatim or appropriately sum-
marizing its pertinent provisions; and (c) to the date of judgment
or decree sought to be reviewed and the date upon which the appli-
cation for appeal is presented.
"The statement shall show that the nature of the case and of the
rulings of the court was such as to bring the case within the juris-
dictional provisions relied on, including a statement of the grounds
upon which it is contended the questions involved are substantial
(Zucht v. King, 260 U. S. 174, 176, 177), and shall cite the cases
believed to sustain the jurisdiction.
"If the appeal is from a state court the statement shall specify
the stage in the proceedings in the court of first instance, and in
the appellate court, at which, and the manner in which, the federal
questions sought to be reviewed were raised; the method of raising
them (e. g., by a pleading, by request to charge and exceptions, by
assignment of error); and the way in which they were passed upon
by the court; with pertinent quotations of specific portions of the
record, or summary thereof, with specific reference to the places
in the record where the matter appears (e. g., ruling on exception,
portion of the court's charge and exception thereto, assignment of
error), as will support the assertion that the rulings of the court
were of a nature to bring the case within the statutory provision
believed to confer jurisdiction on this court.
"The applicant shall append to the statement a copy of any opin-
ions delivered upon the rendering of the judgment or decree sought
to be reviewed, including earlier opinions in the same case, or
opinions in companion cases, reference to which may be necessary
to ascertain the grounds of the judgment or decree.
"If the appeal is from an interlocutory decree of a specially consti-
tuted District Court of the United States (Judicial Code, sec. 266;
U. S. C., Tit. 28, sec. 380), the statement must also include a showing

of the matters in which it is claimed that the court has abused its
discretion in granting or denying the interlocutory injunction.
