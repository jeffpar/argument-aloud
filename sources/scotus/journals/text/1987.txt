The Chief Justice said:
"Before I call the first case for argument, I would like to make a part
of the record of this Court an exchange of correspondence between the
Court and Justice Powell upon his retirement. Our letter to Justice
Powell which is signed by his eight colleagues and his response will be
made a part of the Journal of today's proceedings."
Our letter to Justice Powell reads as follows:
Supreme Court of the United States,
Washington, D.C., June 29, 1987.
Chambers of the Chief Justice
Dear Lewis,
You know without our telling you again how saddened we are by your
departure from our ranks. For more than fifteen years we have bene-
fited from your wise and careful marshaling of arguments in Confer-
ence, and from your shouldering Term after Term of more than your
share of the Court's opinion writing. All of us admire your extraordi-
nary capacity to forcefully participate in our private and public debates
without ever allowing advocacy to degenerate into contentiousness.
Your career in the legal profession before coming here was replete
with laurels. Thirty years of successful law practice, wartime service
overseas in Air Force Intelligence, President of the American Bar As-

sociation, President of the Richmond School Board were but some of
your accomplishments. The lessons from a life so rich in experience in-
formed your judgment as a member of the Court.
We bid you a fond farewell as you retire from this last arena in which
you have served your profession and served your country. We are
grateful for, and look forward to, the prospect of your continued
companionship in the future.
Affectionately,
William H. Rehnquist.
William J. Brennan, Jr.
Byron R. White.

Justice Powell's response reads as follows:
Supreme Court of the United States,
Washington, D.C., July 10, 1987.
Chambers of Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. (Retired)
Dear Colleagues:
Your gracious letter of June 29 was forwarded to me here in Rich-
mond. It is a letter I am proud to share with Jo and our children, and
one I shall always treasure.
I can add little to what I said in my statement of June 26. I do leave
the Court with a considerable measure of sadness. I have been privi-
leged to serve on a strong Court, and also I have cherished the friend-
ship I have shared with each of you. This, of course, will continue al-
though I will miss more than I can say the day to day participation in
the work of the Court.
With admiration and affection for each of you.
Sincerely,
Lewis.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Present: Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice Brennan, Justice White,
Justice Marshall, Justice Blackmun, Justice Stevens, Justice O'Connor,
Justice Scalia and Justice Kennedy.
The Chief Justice said:
"Today's orders of the Court have been certified by the Chief Justice,

OPINIONS PER CURIAM
No. 86-987. Alexander Haig, et al., Petitioners v. Gladys Bissonette,
et al. On writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the
Eighth Circuit. Because the Court lacks a quorum, 28 U.S.C. Section 1,
and since a majority of the Justices are of the opinion that the case can-
not be heard and determined at the next Term of the Court, the judg-
ment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is
affirmed under 28 U.S.C. Section 2109, which provides that under
these circumstances the Court shall enter its order affirming the judg-
ment of the court from which the case was brought for review with the
same effect as upon affirmance by an equally divided Court. The Chief
Justice, Justice O'Connor, Justice Scalia, and Justice Kennedy took no
part in this decision.
No. 87–133. Mercilyn Buchanan, etc., Petitioner v. Stanships, Inc.,
et al. On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The petition for writ of certiorari is
