Commission of Investigation. Appeal from the Supreme Court of
New Jersey. In this case probable jurisdiction is noted limited to
questions 1, 2, 3, and 4 as set forth in the jurisdictional statement

"1. Whether a state immunity statute, and in particular N.J.S.A.
52:9M-17, which merely prevents the subsequent use of a witness's

MONDAY, MARCH 1, 1971
335
testimony and evidence derived therefrom is sufficient to supplant
the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination?
"2. Whether Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U.S. 547 (1892), which
stated that 'absolute immunity against further prosecution' is re-
quired before the Fifth Amendment privilege may be supplanted, is
still the law of the land?
"3. Whether the immunity statute in question, N.J.S.A. 52:9M-17
is constitutionally defective due to its provision that only a 'responsive'
answer, or evidence derived therefrom will not be used against the
witness, where the statute provides no guidelines for determining what
is a 'responsive' answer?
"4. Whether the immunity statute, N.J.S.A. 52:9M-17, can sup-
plant the Fifth Amendment privilege when it fails to provide im-
munity against foreign prosecution, with respect to an individual who
has a real fear of such foreign prosecution?"
As to all other questions set forth in the jurisdictional statement, the
appeal is dismissed for want of a substantial Federal question.
Mr. Justice Brennan took no part in the consideration or decision of
this matter.

Present: Mr. Chief Justice Burger, Mr. Justice Black, Mr. Justice
Douglas, Mr. Justice Harlan, Mr. Justice Brennan, Mr. Justice Stew-
art, Mr. Justice White, Mr. Justice Marshall, and Mr. Justice
Blackmun.
The Chief Justice said:

OPINION PER CURIAM
No. 5928. George Washington Durham, petitioner, v. United
States. On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Motion leave to proceed in forma
pauperis and petition for writ of certiorari granted. Judgment va-
cated and case remanded to the United States District Court for the
District of Oregon with directions to dismiss the indictment. Opinion
per curiam. Mr. Justice Marshall with whom The Chief Justice and
Mr. Justice Stewart join believes that the case should be dismissed as
moot. Dissenting opinion by Mr. Justice Blackmun.
APPEALS SUMMARY DISPOSITIONS
No. 1115. Magar E. Magar, appellant, v. Maryland. Appeal from
the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland. The appeal is dismissed
for want of jurisdiction. Treating the papers whereon the appeal was
taken as a petition for writ of certiorari, certiorari is denied.
No. 1132. City of Millard, Nebraska, et al., appellants, v. City of
Omaha, Nebraska, et al. Appeal from the Supreme Court of Nebraska.
The appeal is dismissed for want of a substantial federal question.
Mr. Justice Blackmun is of the opinion that probable jurisdiction
should be noted and the case set for oral argument.
No. 1133. D. Reece Williams, III, et al., appellants, v. Robert E.
McNair, Governor of South Carolina, et al. Appeal from the United
States District Court for the District of South Carolina. The judgment
is affirmed. Mr. Justice Harlan is of the view that the Court lacks
jurisdiction over this direct appeal from a decision of a three-judge
court denying injunctive relief because the state statute attacked was
not one of "general and statewide application". Moody v. Flowers, 387
U.S. 97, 101 (1967). Therefore, he would vacate the judgment of the
430-278-71—84

MONDAY, MARCH 8, 1971

District Court and remand the case to that court so that it might enter
a fresh decree from which timely appeal could be taken to the Court
of Appeals. See Rockefeller v. Catholic Medical Center, 397 U.S. 820
(1970).
No. 1151. In the Matter of Richard A. Napolitano, appellant. Ap-
peal from the Illinois Courts Commission. The appeal is dismissed for

dismiss appeal for want of jurisdiction.

MONDAY. MARCH 22, 1971
The Chief Justice said:
414
"Before we hear arguments in the first case today I have a pleasant
task, if it can be called that. This is the nearest sitting of the Court
to Friday, the 19th of March, and that is an important day because
it marked the 80th birthday of the very distinguished former Chief
Justice of the United States, Earl Warren.
"This is another milestone in his great career of public service which
extends over a period of more than a half century. Chief Justice
Warren presided over this Court for a few months short of 16 years
and in one the most important periods in the history of the Court
and the country.
"I know that I speak for every one of my colleagues on the bench
and for Mr. Justice Reed and Mr. Justice Clark, retired, when I say
for the record, and to you, sir, Chief Justice Warren, that we wish you
the best of everything in the years ahead and many, many more years
of the vigorous good health which you have always enjoyed and our
very best wishes to you and to Mrs. Warren on the occasion of your
80th birthday."

plication of the Solicitor General of the United States for a stay
herein and the opposition to such stay on behalf of the respondents
presented to the Chief Justice as Circuit Justice for the District of
Columbia Circuit at 6:00 p.m. on April 20, 1971, the Chief Justice
entered an order dated April 20, 1971, vacating the order of the United
States Court of Appeals, dated April 19, 1971, which modified the

WEDNESDAY, APRIL 21, 1971
493
preliminary injunction issued on April 16, 1971, by the United States
District Court for the District of Columbia and reinstated the said
order of the District Court dated April 16, 1971, pending further order
of the Court; and said matter being referred by the Chief Justice to
the Court and the Court having consideerd the matter,
It is ordered
(1) that the Order of the United States Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit dated April 19, 1971, modifying the
preliminary injunction issued by the United States District Court
for the District of Columbia on April 16, 1971, is vacated;
(2) that the preliminary injunction issued by the United States Dis-
trict Court herein on April 16, 1971, is reinstated with full force and
effect. Mr. Justice Douglas took no part in the consideration of this
matter.
Adjourned until Monday, April 26, 1971, at 10 o'clock.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Present: Mr. Chief Justice Burger, Mr. Justice Black, Mr. Justice
Douglas, Mr. Justice Harlan, Mr. Justice Brennan, Mr. Justice
Stewart, Mr. Justice White, Mr. Justice Marshall, and Mr. Justice
Blackmun.
The Chief Justice said:
"Today's orders of the Court have been certified by the Chief Jus-
tice, filed with the Clerk, and will not be announced orally."
PER CURIAM
No.
-
Wilfred Keyes, petitioner, v. School District Number
One, Denver, Colorado. The sole basis for the Tenth Circuit's action
in granting the stay of the District Court's order in this case was the
view "that it would be unfair to the School District to compel it to
take further steps in the implementation of the total plan until (the
Tenth Circuit) and the party litigants have the benefit of the United
States Supreme Court decisions in the Swann and combined desegre-
gation cases. . .”
The decisions in those cases having now been announced, it is proper
to vacate the stay and remit the matter to the Court of Appeals freed
of its earlier speculation as to the bearing of our decision in the Swann
cases.
We, of course, intimate no views upon the merits of the underlying
issues.
Mr. Justice White took no part in the consideration or decision of
this matter.
ORDERS IN PENDING CASES

penses shall be charged against and be borne by the parties in such
proportion as the Court hereafter may approve.

same effect as if originally made by the Court herein.
No. 1285. United States, petitioner, v. Denneth Bass. The motion
of respondent for the appointment of counsel is granted, and it is

The Chief Justice said:
"Today we wish to take note of the retirement of Edmund P. Cul-
linan, Chief Deputy Clerk of this Court, after 41 years of dedicated
services to the Court. Mr. Cullinan entered the service of the Court
in 1930, the same year that Charles Evans Hughes became Chief Jus-

tice. He has thus served with five of its 15 Chief Justices. Through
those years his conscientious and able performance of duty has con-
tributed immeasurably to the efficient operation of the Supreme Court.
"Thousands of litigants and countless members of the Bar of the
Court are indebted to him for his skillful and expeditious attention to
their problems, great and small. They are indebted to him, too, for his
unfailing courtesy and his capacity for sensitive understanding of
their individual needs and problems.
"These days we speak often of the importance of efficient court ad-
ministration. Edmund Cullinan labored more than four decades in that
cause, and he did it with unobtrusive loyalty and high professional
skill. No detail was ever too small to escape his thoughtful attention,
and no task ever too large to deter his conscientious efforts. Few
have ever equalled his grasp of procedure and practice before the
Supreme Court.
"His 41 years of honorable service with the Court have been uni-
formly characterized by the qualities of integrity and unswerving
devotion to duty that are indispensable to the efficient and fair admin-
istration of justice. His retirement is a loss to the Court and to all
who come here.
"I know I speak for all the members of the Court, and for our pred-
ecessors with whom he served, when I express our heartfelt thanks
to Edmund P. Cullinan as he leaves the institution he loved so well
and served so loyally; and he leaves with our best wishes for the
future."

No. 5056. Lyman A. Moore, petitioner, v. Illinois. Motion of
American Civil Liberties Union, Illinois Division, and Illinois Com-
mittee for the Abolition of Capital Punishment for leave to file a
brief, as amici curiae, granted. Motion for leave to proceed in forma
pauperis granted. Petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court
of Illinois granted limited to Questions 1, 3 and 4 set fourth in the
petition which read as follows:
"1. Petitioner was sentenced to death for murder. Six items of
exonerating evidence were not disclosed to him at trial. The court
below affirmed on the ground that the prosecution's duty to disclose
exonerating evidence depends upon a request; that the prosecutor had
shown his entire file to defense counsel at trial and no further request
for disclosure was made. None of the exonerating items was con-
tained in said file. Trial defense counsel were ignorant of the existence
of the suppressed information.
"Questions presented are:
"(a) Whether a request is an indispensable prerequisite to
disclosure of exonerating evidence by the State?
"(b) Whether material evidence favorable to an accused
should be disclosed by the State without a request where such
evidence is not recorded?
"(c) Whether denial of due process of law is contingent upon
a request where a State knowingly permits false testimony to
remain uncorrected?
"(d) Where a prosecutor shows his entire file to defense coun-
sel at trial, but none of the exonerating items of evidence are
contained in said file, does that satisfy the prosecution's duty of
disclosure?
"(e) Whether nondisclosure of the prosecuting police depart-
ment is imputable to the prosecution?
"3. The deceased was killed with a twelve-gauge shotgun. The
Chicago Scientific Crime Detection Laboratory determined that he
was killed with a twelve-gauge shotgun. (A.139.) The prosecutor
stated in a Bill of Particulars that the murder weapon was a twelve-
gauge shotgun. (A.2.)
Over objection (A.81-94), the prosecution introduced a sixteen-
gauge shotgun into evidence. (A.94.) The sixteen-gauge shotgun did
not belong to the petitioner, was not recovered from him, and was
never in his possession or control. (A.58, 66–71.)

MONDAY, JUNE 28, 1971
682
During closing argument the prosecutor told the jury that the
sixteen-gauge shotgun was not the weapon that killed the deceased,
but that any man who was with another man who had the shotgun
and shells for it was the type of person that deserved the death
penalty. (A.191–201, 204–206.)
The question presented is whether the introduction and use of
such evidence, totally unconnected with the petitioner or the crime
charged, denied the petitioner a fair trial?
"4. Eight veniremen were removed for cause when they voiced
general objections to capital punishment or stated that they had
religious or conscientious scruples against the death penalty in a
proper case.
"In the light of Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510, may a state
court of review affirm a death sentence,
"(a) on the ground that the tenor of voir dire examination
was unlike that of Witherspoon?
"(b) on the ground that the prosecution had sufficient per-
emptory challenges to have eliminated those prospective jurors
eligible to serve under Witherspoon?"
CERTIORARI DENIED
No. 35. Allen Frank Davis, petitioner, v. Arkansas. Petition for
writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Arkansas denied.
No. 1508. Maurice Williams et al., petitioners, v. Sidney A. Seegers
et al. Petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Louisi-

for an order requiring the District Court to hold timely hearings, enter
such orders and entertain such proceedings as may be necessary to
achieve a unitary school system in Knoxville by the commencement of
the 1971-1972 school year was presented to Mr. JUSTICE STEWART and
by him referred to the Court. The motion is denied. The United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee has not had an
opportunity since the June 22, 1971, remand of the case by the United
States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit to inquire whether
respondents have failed to maintain a unitary school system as defined
in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1
(1971), and prior cases. Of course, the District Court must conduct
forthwith such proceedings as may be required for the prompt deter
mination of this question, and, should it find that respondents have not
maintained a unitary school system, respondents must "terminate dual
school systems at once. . . ." Alexander v. Holmes County Board of
Education, 396 U. S. 19 (1969). The mandate of the Court of Appeals
should issue forthwith.
