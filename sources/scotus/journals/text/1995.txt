(JOURNAL)                 MONDAY, OCTOBER 2, 1995                      1
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

   Present: Justice Stevens, Justice O’Connor, Justice Scalia, Justice
Kennedy, Justice Souter, Justice Thomas, Justice Ginsburg, and Jus-
tice Breyer.
   Justice Stevens said:
   “The Chief Justice underwent a laminectomy last week. Although
the operation was entirely successful, he will not be with us for a few
days. He has reserved the right to participate in the cases that will be
argued before he returns to the Bench. Because of his absence, I have
the honor to announce, on behalf of the Court, that the October 1994
Term of the Supreme Court of the United States is now closed and the
October 1995 Term is now convened.
   “Today’s orders of the Court have been duly entered and certified
and filed with the Clerk. They will not be otherwise announced.”

                   Appeals—Summary Disposition
   No. 94–1922. Rural West Tennessee African-American Affairs Coun-
cil, Inc., et al., Appellants v. Don Sundquist, Governor of Tennessee, et
al. Appeal from the United States District Court for the Western Dis-
trict of Tennessee. The judgment is affirmed. Justice Stevens would
note probable jurisdiction and set the case for oral argument.
   No. 94–2032. James Franklin, et al., Appellants v. Jeffrey Lawri-
more, et al. Appeal from the United States District Court for the Dis-
trict of South Carolina. The judgment is vacated and the case is re-
manded to the United States District Court for the District of South

(JOURNAL)                 TUESDAY, APRIL 30, 1996                   769
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

   Present: Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice Stevens, Justice O’Connor,
Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, Justice Souter, Justice Thomas, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer.
   The Chief Justice said:
   “The Court is in special session this afternoon to receive the Resolu-
tions of the Bar of the Supreme Court in tribute to our late colleague
and friend, Chief Justice Warren Earl Burger.
   “The Court recognizes the Solicitor General.
   Mr. Solicitor General addressed the Court as follows:
   “Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: At a meeting of the
members of the Bar of the Supreme Court this afternoon, resolutions
memorializing our regard for the Honorable Warren E. Burger and
expressing our profound sorrow at his death were unanimously
adopted. With the Court’s leave, and following recent precedent, I shall
read selectively from the resolutions at this time and shall ask that
they be set forth in their entirety in the records of the Court.

                            “RESOLUTION”
  “Warren Earl Burger served the Court and the country as Chief
Justice of the United States from 1969 until his retirement in 1986.
Lawyer, administrator, and jurist, Warren Burger embodied the finest
traditions of American law in a career that spanned 65 years.
  “Chief Justice Burger was very much a product of this Nation, a
practical man with a passion for freedom and an understanding of the
responsibilities that freedom entails.
  “As a judge, he understood that the exercise of liberty must be
guided by our traditions constrained by the rule of law. As an adminis-
trator, he sought tirelessly to improve the ways in which the legal
system works for the people it is supposed to serve. Above all, as a
lawyer, he knew the importance of tempering abstract legal doctrine
with common sense.
  “The resolution describes Burger’s birth and early life in Minnesota,
how he worked his way through college and law school and quickly
established himself as one of the preeminent lawyers in the State’s
private bar, his marriage to Elvera Stromberg, who would be his life-
long companion, and commitment to his family, and his increasing
involvement in the affairs of his community.

   “An incident of that time helps illustrate Burger’s personal commit-
ment to the principles that animate the Constitution. After Pearl Har-
bor, there was widespread support for the policy of forcibly relocating
California’s Japanese Americans. The young St. Paul lawyer’s voice
was one of the few to argue that these citizens’ constitutional rights
ought not be sacrificed to popular passion.
   “He organized a committee of the Council on Human Relations to
help resettle some of them in Minnesota, and opened his home to one
family for nearly a year while the father looked for work.
   “Although Burger refused all requests that he run for public office,
he became deeply involved in Minnesota political life. At the 1952 Re-
publican National Convention, he was instrumental in swinging his
State delegation to support Dwight D. Eisenhower, thereby assuring
General Eisenhower the party’s nomination.
   “Following the election, President Eisenhower called him to Wash-
ington to serve as an Assistant Attorney General of the United States
in charge of the Civil Division. The resolution discusses his outstanding
contributions at the helm of the Civil Division until his appointment, 3
years later, to the United States Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia.
   “At that time, the Federal courts of the District of Columbia had the
widest jurisdiction of any courts in the United States, functioning as
the equivalent of State courts for the District itself, as well as having
the regular jurisdiction of other Federal courts.
   “Judge Burger quickly found himself embroiled in important contro-
versies regarding the criminal law that were sweeping both the legal
profession and the Nation at the time. Burger’s opinions, whether for
the court or in dissent, grew to the view that solicitude for the rights
of the defendant should be tempered by recognition of the need to
enforce the law, yet he was reluctant to press to overrule prior deci-
sions, preferring instead to curtail their reach while preserving their
essence.
   “The resolution then describes aspects of Burger’s tenure at the D.C.
Circuit, which established him as a leader on his court and throughout
the Nation.
   “When Chief Justice Earl Warren retired, President Nixon turned
to Warren E. Burger. With the unanimous endorsement of the Judiciary
Committee, Burger was quickly confirmed by the Senate. He was
sworn in as Chief Justice of the United States on June 23, 1969.
   “There were many who expected that as Chief Justice he would try
to overturn the landmark criminal law decisions of the Warren Court,

but neither those who hoped for this outcome, nor those who feared it,
seemed to have considered that one of the hallmarks of this judge was
respect for precedent.
   “Chief Justice Burger cared too deeply for the great institution that
is the Supreme Court of the United States to believe that its decisions,
the articulation of our Nation’s highest law, could be tossed aside when-
ever there was a change of personnel on the bench.
   “His approach to major criminal law precedents such as Miranda v.
Arizona and Mapp v. Ohio was to leave such rulings intact, while
defining their outer limits.
   “Under his leadership, for instance, the Court held that an otherwise
inadmissible statement could be used to impeach a defendant’s credibil-
ity at trial. He joined in one opinion establishing a public safety excep-
tion to Miranda and, in another, deciding that a confession obtained in
violation of Miranda did not taint a second valid confession obtained
later.
   “Similarly, the Court he led trimmed the exclusionary rule enshrined
in Mapp by carving out good faith exceptions.
   “Burger’s conservatism was of that American strain which insists
that the law protect the individual from the excesses of State power.
He was to state clearly and repeatedly that he would never vote to
overrule Miranda because to do so would be an invitation to lawless-
ness by law enforcement authorities.
   “He concurred in decisions extending to misdemeanor cases the right
of indigent defendants to counsel, and recognizing a defendant’s right
to a psychiatrist if necessary for his defense.
   “Chief Justice Burger placed a premium on protecting individual lib-
erties. His strong commitment to the First Amendment values of free-
dom of speech and the press can be seen in many of his opinions.
   “In Wooley v. Maynard, for example, he authored the opinion holding
that a State may not compel an individual to carry on his license plate
a slogan offensive to his deeply held views.
   “Yet Burger also recognized that our freedoms are not absolute, that
there are limits beyond which we may not go without trampling on the
rights of others. In Miller v. California, Chief Justice Burger crafted
the definition of obscenity that we use today.
   “Further, in declaring that it was up to local juries applying contem-
porary community standards to decide whether a particular work fit
the Court’s formulation, he put to rest the idea that there was some
uniform national community standard in such matters.

   “The resolution describes The Chief Justice’s commitment to the
freedom of conscience exemplified by his opinions for the Court inter-
preting the religion clauses in cases such as Lemon v. Kurtzman and
Wisconsin v. Yoder.
   “Turning to Burger’s contributions to the area of civil rights, the
resolution observes that, as district courts became involved in compli-
cated questions of quotas, racial balance, redrawing of school district
lines, busing and more, many doubted the propriety of the Court’s
involvement at all, and some believed that Chief Justice Burger was
hostile to such efforts.
   “He put disbelief to rest in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board
of Education. Writing for a unanimous Court, The Chief Justice em-
phatically affirmed the vital role of the Federal courts in eliminating
all vestiges of racial segregation from public school systems.
   “In other civil rights cases, he led the Court in upholding congres-
sional set-asides of a percentage of public works funds for minority
businesses, invalidating State aid to racially segregated private
schools, and sustaining the Internal Revenue Service’s denial of tax
exemptions to private schools that practice racial discrimination.
   “During Chief Justice Burger’s tenure, the Court also adopted a pro-
gressive approach to the rights of women and members of other disad-
vantaged groups under the Equal Protection Clause. His own more
significant opinions included Reed v. Reed, striking down a State stat-
ute giving preference to men over women in estate administrations,
and Hishon v. King and Spalding, applying Title VII’s prohibition of
sex discrimination to law firm partnership decisions.
   “He voted to end gender classifications on social security dependent
benefits and jury selection, and to declare invalid State laws restricting
aliens’ access to public employment and welfare benefits.
   “After discussing Burger’s role in Roe v. Wade and its progeny, the
resolution turns to The Chief Justice’s extraordinary contributions to
this Court’s separation of powers jurisprudence.
   “Warren Burger was intensely interested in American Government.
He understood fully the concerns that had led the Framers to separate
Government power among competing and mutually restraining legisla-
tive, executive, and judicial branches. In a case that produced one of
his most important opinions, Immigration and Naturalization Service
v. Chadha, the Court invalidated the device known as the one-House
veto.
   “History will surely view Chief Justice Burger’s opinion for the
Court in another separation of powers case as the most significant of

his career, indeed as one of the most important opinions of any justice
at any time. United States v. Nixon was to lead directly to the resigna-
tion of a President.
   “The special prosecutor’s indictment of certain defendants in the Wa-
tergate affair was being hampered by President Nixon’s refusal to turn
over tapes and other records of conversations between him and others,
including Government officials.
   “The President, like several of his predecessors, claimed executive
privilege. The district court had ruled that the special prosecutor had
rebutted the presumption of privilege and ordered an in camera exami-
nation of the subpoenaed material.
   “The Chief Justice’s opinion for the Court upheld the validity of the
district court’s order. The President’s generalized assertion of privilege
could not prevail over the fundamental demands of due process of law
and the fair administration of criminal justice. It would have to yield to
the demonstrated specific need for evidence in a pending criminal trial.
   “Chief Justice Burger’s interest in American Government also
served him well as the administrative leader of the third branch. In-
deed, he took his title, Chief Justice of the United States, seriously. In
his eyes, its mandate encompassed stewardship of the entire judicial
system, State and Federal.
   “His role in reforming the American judicial system was profound.
He was an active leader of the Federal judiciary as Chairman of the
Judicial Conference of the United States. He turned the Federal Judi-
cial Center, of which he was Chairman of the Board by statute, into a
respected source of research and writing about the courts, and a rich
educational resource. He promoted the idea of circuit executives, offi-
cials who now contribute so much to the efficient working of our courts.
   “In addition to his many contributions toward beneficial change,
Chief Justice Burger revered this Court’s history and saw its building
not just as a courtroom and chambers, but as an opportunity to educate
the public.
   “A guiding spirit of the Supreme Court Historical Society and cre-
ator of the position of Curator of the Supreme Court, Burger helped to
fill empty spaces with exhibits and to rekindle discussion and debate
about our constitutional heritage.
   “The resolution finally recounts the qualities that mark The Chief
Justice as a man of great warmth and kindness. This was a man who,
for example, conceived and personally supervised the construction of a
ramp to enable Justice Douglas to take his place at the bench after the
latter’s stroke. He was a man who, for more than 10 years, sent pins

garnered in his world travels to the handicapped child of a former
clerk.
   “Many could not comprehend why Warren Burger would leave one
of the most powerful positions in Government to serve as Chair of the
Commission on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution.
   “They did not know the man, with his love of that normal document,
his understanding of our Nation’s traditions, his appreciation of the
lessons of history, and his faith in the power of education. There was
no one in the United States more suited to the task, and no role more
fitting as a capstone to his distinguished career.
   “We cherish this image of Warren Burger as a teacher of fundamen-
tal democratic values to the Nation’s children and to us all.
   “Wherefore, it is accordingly resolved that we, the Bar of the Su-
preme Court of the United States, express our profound sorrow that
Chief Justice Warren E. Burger is no longer with us, our admiration
for his deep understanding of our history and traditions as a Nation,
and his commitment to those wide restraints that make us free, and
our gratitude for his ceaseless labors to improve the administration of
the Nation’s system of justice; and it is further
   “RESOLVED that the Solicitor General be asked to present these
resolutions to the Court, and that the Attorney General be asked to
move that they be inscribed upon the Court’s permanent records.”
   The Chief Justice said:
   “Thank you, Mr. Solicitor General. I recognize the Attorney General
of the United States.”
  Attorney General Reno addressed the Court as follows:
  “Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
  “The Bar of this Court met today to honor the memory of Warren
Earl Burger, The Chief Justice of the United States from 1969 to 1986.
  “Born in St. Paul in 1907 to a family of modest means, Warren
Burger was raised on a small truck farm in Stacy, Minnesota. He at-
tended local public schools and in high school was president of the
Student Council and editor of the school newspaper, and he lettered in
football, hockey, swimming, and track.
  “He then worked his way, selling insurance by day, through the Uni-
versity of Minnesota and the St. Paul College of Law, now William
Mitchell, where he attended nights, receiving his law degree magna
cum laude in 1931. Two years later, he married Elvera Stromberg.
Harry Blackmun, his childhood friend and future colleague on this
Court, was best man.

   “After graduating from law school, he soon joined an established firm
in St. Paul, where he became a partner. From the beginning, Warren
Burger demonstrated in both his public and his private life a deep
commitment to just treatment of individuals of all races.
   “In the 1940’s, he served on St. Paul’s first Council on Human Rights,
which he helped organize to fight racial discrimination, and when Japa-
nese Americans were forced to leave their West Coast homes following
the bombing of Pearl Harbor, he led a committee to help resettle those
who had been displaced.
   “He became aligned politically with Harold Stassen, managing Stas-
sen’s first gubernatorial campaign in 1938, and his campaign for the
Republican presidential nomination in 1948.
   “While serving as Stassen’s floor manager at the Republican Na-
tional Convention in 1952, Burger pledged the Minnesota delegation’s
support to Dwight Eisenhower, ensuring Eisenhower’s nomination on
the first ballot.
   “His energy, abilities, and political acumen did not go unnoticed. In
1953, he left Minnesota for Washington, D.C., accepting President Ei-
senhower’s appointment to serve as an Assistant Attorney General in
charge of the Civil Division under Attorney General Brownell. His dis-
tinguished service in that capacity included several appearances before
this Court.
   “In 1956, President Eisenhower persuaded the Assistant Attorney
General to forgo his return to private practice in St. Paul and instead
to accept the President’s nomination to a seat on the United States
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. He would serve with
distinction on that influential court for 13 years, developing a national
reputation.
   “Judge Burger’s express desire to restore greater balance to the
criminal justice system caught the attention of the newly inaugurated
Richard Nixon. Impressed as well with Judge Burger’s reputation as
an outstanding jurist, President Nixon nominated him to replace the
retiring Earl Warren.
   “Less than 5 weeks later, on June 23rd, 1969, Warren Burger was
sworn in as this Nation’s fifteenth Chief Justice. He served in that role
for 17 years, longer than any other Chief Justice in the 20th Century.
   “Confounding the expectations of those who hoped, or feared, that
he would immediately set about reversing the decisions of the Warren
era, the new Chief Justice was not an advocate for radical change. His
experiences as a practitioner, as Government official, as Federal judge,

776                       TUESDAY, APRIL 30, 1996

had instilled in him a skepticism towards rigid doctrinal views of any
stripe.
   “His jurisprudence was complex and nuanced, but consistently re-
flective of certain core values, a reverence for the constitutional frame-
work envisioned by the Founders, a deep appreciation of the personal
and structural importance of our fundamental liberties, including those
of the people as an organized community, an understanding that the law
must take account of realities beyond the courtroom, and a steadfast
dedication to improving the administration of justice.
   “In addition to his contributions as a jurist, Warren Burger’s tenure
was remarkable for his intensive efforts to improve the quality of both
the bench and the bar. He implemented the most significant administra-
tive overhaul of this Court since the Taft era, directing substantial
investments in systems and modernization and at the same time devot-
ing significant resources to the preservation and commemoration of the
Court’s traditions and history, making the Court a more accessible and
welcoming place for the thousands who visit its halls.
   “As Chief Justice of the United States, Burger approached the task
of judicial administration with an appreciation that how justice is dis-
pensed at every level directly affects the lives of the people.
   “In 1971, for example, he helped found the National Center for State
Courts in Williamsburg, Virginia, which provides information, educa-
tion, and management services for Court leaders.
   “Following a prison riot at Attica, New York, he was instrumental
in establishing the National Institute of Corrections, an agency
charged with providing specialized correction service to State and local
corrections agencies, and as Chairman of the Board of the Federal Judi-
cial Center, The Chief Justice guided the newly established center’s
growth into a full fledged agency for research and training for the
Federal courts.
   “The Chief Justice also visited and studied legal institutions in vari-
ous parts of the globe, and participated actively in symposia with schol-
ars and statesmen from around the world.
   “Drawing largely on the British experience, he promoted the estab-
lishment and growth of the American Inns of Court program, which
today has hundreds of local chapters throughout the 50 States and the
District of Columbia, bringing novice attorneys together with more
experienced attorneys and local judges to help the former develop trial
skills and to promote more generally a sense of ethics and fellowship
within the profession.

   “Burger’s concern for the practical effect of legal rules played an
important part in his jurisprudence. He was, for example, skeptical
that the benefits of the exclusionary rule justified its cost to society.
While the Court has retained the exclusionary rule, Chief Justice
Burger played a key part in excepting from its reach classes of cases
that do not persuasively implicate the rule’s deterrence rationale.
   “Most noticeably, he delivered the opinion of the Court in Nix v.
Williams, recognizing the inevitable discovery exception. The basis for
the exception was explicitly pragmatic. If the prosecution can establish
by a preponderance of the evidence that the information ultimately
or inevitably would have been discovered by lawful means, then the
deterrence rationale has so little basis that the evidence should be
received.
   “The Chief Justice’s reluctance to afford unlimited scope to abstract
doctrine featured prominently in his landmark opinion for a unanimous
court in United States v. Nixon, upholding the special prosecutor’s
subpoena of the President’s tape-recorded conversations.
   “Although The Chief Justice recognized that the President has a le-
gitimate need for confidentiality in the performance of his executive
duties, he rejected the contention that the President is entitled to an
absolute privilege from disclosure.
   “The Chief Justice observed that privileges against forced disclosure
are rare exceptions to the demand for every man’s evidence. They are
not lightly created nor expansively construed, for they are in deroga-
tion of the search for truth.
   “Though skeptical of judgemade rules, Chief Justice Burger ob-
served strict fidelity to the dictates of the Constitution, particularly
the structural limitations that inhere in the separation of powers,
which he believed critical to the stability of our system of governance.
   “In 1983, he delivered the landmark opinion in INS v. Chadha, strik-
ing down on separation of powers grounds a one-House veto provision
in the Immigration and Nationality Act, which permitted either House
of Congress unilaterally to overrule immigration decisions delegated
by law to the discretion of the Attorney General.
   “Notwithstanding Congress’ use of similar provisions in literally
hundreds of enactments, the Court held the one-House veto procedure
to be violative of the constitutional requirements for a valid legislative
act, namely, bicameral approval and presentment to the President.
   “The Chief Justice’s opinion explained: ‘The choices we discern as
having been made in the Constitutional Convention impose burdens
on governmental processes that often seem clumsy, inefficient, even
JNL95$ud30—06-15-96 15:47:27       JOURNAPGT           MILES




778                        TUESDAY, APRIL 30, 1996

unworkable, but those hard choices were consciously made by men who
had lived under a form of government that permitted arbitrary govern-
mental acts to go unchecked.
   ‘With all the obvious flaws of delay, untidiness, and potential for
abuse, we have not yet found a better way to preserve freedom than by
making the exercise of power subject to the carefully crafted restraints
spelled out in the Constitution.’
   “Toward the end of his tenure, Chief Justice Burger again wrote for
the Court in Bowsher v. Synar, striking down provisions of the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act that required the President to make
budget cuts specified by the Comptroller General under certain emer-
gency conditions.
   “Concluding that the Comptroller General was answerable to Con-
gress, The Chief Justice rejected the argument that he was unlikely,
in fact, to act as an agent for the legislative branch. The separation of
powers must be strictly enforced, he wrote, because as the Founders
well understood, in the long term, structural protections against abuse
of power are critical to preserving liberty.
   “To Warren Burger, there was special significance in the first three
words of the Constitution: ‘We, the People.’ They were a concise, yet
momentous declaration that for the first time in history, power was
created in a Government from the bottom up, not from the top down.
   “That Government was under the Constitution, therefore would not
always be tidy, was all only natural. Democracy, as The Chief Justice
understood it, is people, men and women with all their virtues and
flaws, trying to work together to produce ordered liberty.
   “The Chief Justice’s abiding faith in the ordinary men and women of
this Nation is reflected in his belief that along with the structural
safeguards afforded by the separation of powers, the guarantees of the
First Amendment are critical to the maintenance of ordered liberty.
   “The link between structural integrity and free speech is manifest
in his several opinions involving the right of the people to hear, see,
and communicate observations concerning criminal proceedings. The
Chief Justice explained that people in an open society do not demand
infallibility from their institutions, but it is difficult for them to accept
what they are prohibited from observing.
   “Warren Burger’s appreciation of the value of individual liberties
was reflected in many of his constitutional opinions. In Wisconsin v.
Yoder, for example, where the Court upheld on free exercise grounds
the right of Amish parents to except their offspring from uniform State
schooling requirements, he recognized as a constitutional imperative
JNL95$ud30—06-15-96 15:47:27      JOURNAPGT          MILES




                          TUESDAY, APRIL 30, 1996                     779
the principle that a way of life that is odd or even erratic but interferes
with no rights or interests of others is not to be condemned because it
is different.
   “In Wooley v. Maynard, he again championed the right not to con-
form, authorizing the court’s opinion affirming the right of Jehovah’s
Witnesses to refuse to display the motto, ‘Live Free or Die’, on their
New Hampshire license plates. He explained that where the State’s
interest is to disseminate an ideology, no matter how acceptable to
some, such interests cannot outweigh an individual’s First Amendment
right to avoid being the courier for such message.
   “He recognized at the same time, however, that the claims of individ-
ual liberty do not invariably outweigh the right of the people as a
community to foster and protect common values and needs. Under the
now-familiar standard for the Court articulated by The Chief Justice
in Miller v. California, whether speech is obscene and therefore un-
protected is judged from the viewpoint of the average person applying
contemporary community standards.
   “And in Paris Adult Theater I v. Slaton, he upheld for the Court
the State’s authority to regulate the exhibition of obscene material in
places of public accommodation, recognizing that the State’s legitimate
interest encompassed the interest of the public in the quality of life in
the total community environment, the tone of commerce in the great
city centers, and possibly the public safety itself.
   “In the Chief Justice’s jurisprudence, the balance of individual and
community rights is sensitive, as exemplified by his opinions for the
Court in cases involving claims of religious establishment. In upholding
New York’s tax exemption for property used for religious education
or charitable purposes in Walz v. Tax Commission of New York, he
acknowledged that the test is inescapably one of degree, and explained
that it is an essential part of adjudication to draw distinctions, includ-
ing fine ones, in the process of interpreting the Constitution.
   “In the following year, in Lemon v. Kurtzman, The Chief Justice
again wrote for the Court, this time striking down State programs
providing aid to parochial schools that fostered an excessive degree of
entanglement of church and State.
   “Finally, Warren Burger remained true on the bench to his lifelong
commitment to the equal treatment of individuals, irrespective of race
or national origin. In one of his first major opinions as Chief Justice,
he delivered the Court’s unanimous opinion in Swann v. Charlotte-
Mecklenburg Board of Education. Affirming the propriety of compre-
hensive relief, including busing of students to remedy racial segrega-
JNL95$ud30—06-15-96 15:47:27      JOURNAPGT          MILES




780                       TUESDAY, APRIL 30, 1996

tion in education, he was equally vigilant in guarding against less di-
rect, but still invidious forms of discrimination.
   “He wrote opinions for the Court adopting a disparate impact stand-
ard for Federal statutory claims of racial discrimination in employ-
ment, condemning on equal protection grounds the provision of State
aid to racially segregated private schools and sustaining the denial of
Federal tax exemptions to private schools that practice racial
discrimination.
   “Nor were racial minorities the only beneficiaries of The Chief Jus-
tice’s abiding belief in equal work. In his opinion in Reed v. Reed, the
Court for the first time struck down on equal protection grounds a
State statute that arbitrarily discriminated against women, and in His-
hon v. King and Spalding, his opinion for the Court held that the
Federal statutory prohibition of sex discrimination in employment ap-
plies to partnership decisions made by a law firm.
   “It was because of his dedication to, indeed, reverence for the princi-
ples embodied in our Constitution that Warren Burger retired from the
Supreme Court in 1986 to head the Commission on the Bicentennial of
the Constitution. He served in that capacity as a tireless emissary of
the Constitution to the ordinary men and women, and particularly the
children of this Nation.
   “In that role, as in all of the varied contexts in which he toiled and
emerged as a leader in the law, as private lawyer, Assistant Attorney
General, appellate judge, and Chief Justice of the United States, his
dedication to liberty and equality, his faith in the citizens of this land,
and his commitment to maintaining the integrity of our constitutional
structure, guided his steps and consequently illuminated the path for
us all.
   “Mr. Chief Justice, on behalf of the lawyers of this Nation and, in
particular, of the Bar of this Court, I respectfully request that the
resolutions presented to you in honor and celebration of the memory
of Chief Justice Warren E. Burger be accepted by the Court, and that
they, together with the chronicle of these proceedings, be ordered kept
for all time in the records of this Court.”
   The Chief Justice said:
   “Thank you, Attorney General Reno, and thank you, General Days.
   “The Court thanks both of you for your presentation today in mem-
ory of our late colleague and friend, Chief Justice Burger.
   “We ask that you convey to Chairman John Sexton and the members

man of today’s meeting of the Bar, our appreciation for these appro-
priate resolutions.
   “Your motion that these resolutions be made a part of the permanent
records of the Court is granted.
   “For 17 years, a longer tenure than all but three of his predecessors,
Warren Burger presided over this Court. During that period of time,
as might be expected, he authored numerous important opinions for
the Court on a variety of subjects. The Nixon tapes case, INS v.
Chadha, Miller v. California, Milliken v. Bradley, Nebraska Press
Association were but a few. The resolutions mentioned many others.
   “He was particularly interested in the constitutional doctrine of sep-
aration of powers, and in the speech and religion clauses of the First
Amendment. He was a person of strong convictions, who was nonethe-
less able to work harmoniously with his colleagues.
   “The English scientist and philosopher, Alfred North Whitehead said
in one of his books, all the world over and at all times, there have been
practical men absorbed in irreducible and stubborn facts. All the world
over, and at all times, there have been men of philosophic temperament
who have been absorbed in the weaving of general principles.
   “No one, of course, is wholly in one of these camps or the other, but
I think one would have to say that Warren Burger was predominantly
in the camp of the practical man, as you have suggested, General Days.
   “He was concerned as to how the Court’s decisions would be trans-
lated into law at the trial level and at the community. To that end, he
was instrumental in the founding of the National Center for State
Courts, as you have mentioned, General Reno, an organization devoted
to providing administrative and technical assistance to State court
systems.
   “He was instrumental in the founding of the Institute for Court Man-
agement. He pioneered the idea of the Inns of Court in the United
States, where law students, faculty, practicing lawyers, and judges
could dine and meet together in the pursuit of their common interests.
   “He was firmly of the view that the English system on which these
Inns were patterned did a better job of disciplining practicing lawyers
than did the more formal procedures employed in this country.
   “Here at the Court, Warren Burger made changes that materially
improved our operation. Take, for example, his reconfiguration of the
bench on which my colleagues and I are now sitting.
   “We take for granted the shape of the bench, and after 25 years it is
understandable, but before the advent of Warren Burger it was an
absolutely straight bench, making it difficult for colleagues on either
JNL95$ud30—06-15-96 15:47:27      JOURNAPGT          MILES




782                       TUESDAY, APRIL 30, 1996

end to question counsel, difficult for colleagues in the middle to hear
questions from either end, and difficult for counsel to address their
remarks to those towards the end of the bench.
   “By simply moving the two wings of the bench slightly forward, all
of these difficulties were corrected or alleviated, although others may
have been brought about.
   “It can also be said, I think, that he made the Court more centrist
by bringing the left and right wings closer together.
   “Chief Justice Burger also brought the Court from the days of a hot
lead printing press to automation in the printing of its opinions. The
hot lead press which we had when I became a member of the Court
some 20 years ago was little different from the printing press the Court
had when I was a law clerk in the early fifties and, indeed, little differ-
ent from the kind of hot lead press on which we set type for our high

   “And during the June crunch, as we came to know it, you would have
to wait 2 or 3 days between the time you sent an opinion, draft opinion
to the printer, and the time you could get it back.
   “This all changed under Chief Justice Burger’s regime, and major
steps toward the kind of automation we have today were taken.
   “Warren Burger was a man of tremendous energy. Often, when a
lawyer takes the bench, he becomes less involved than previously with
the various concerns of the legal profession, but this was not true of
Warren Burger. As an appellate judge, he helped to found the Appel-
late Judges Conference at New York University, and he also played an
important part in the drafting of the standards of criminal justice for
the American Bar Association.
   “When he retired as Chief Justice in 1986, he said that one of the
reasons he did so was that he could not do justice to both the office of
Chief Justice and his position as Chairman of the Committee on the
Bicentennial of the Constitution.
   “When asked why he had chosen his chairmanship over the Chief
Justiceship, he replied that he thought the President would have no
trouble finding someone to be Chief Justice —but he might have trou-
ble finding someone to be Chairman of the Committee on the Bicenten-
nial, and after his retirement, he was able to concentrate on the Bicen-
tennial Commission and bring that tremendous energy to bear to make

home to millions of Americans the significance of their Constitution,
and he succeeded magnificently in doing so.
  “Warren Burger and I were good friends from the first time I met
him, when he informally swore me in as an Associate Justice of this
Court in December 1971. I continue to miss him.
  “I remember stopping in to see him only a few weeks before his
death, and he was very proud of a just-published book he had written
about famous Supreme Court cases entitled, It Is So Ordered. Here
was a man, 88 years old, who had just finished writing a book.
  “Warren Burger, the fifteenth Chief Justice of the United States, left
a large mark on this Court. He also left a large mark on the legal
profession as a whole, a profession in which he retained an abiding
interest throughout his life.”
