SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

   Present: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Thomas, Justice Breyer,
Justice Alito, Justice Sotomayor, Justice Kagan, Justice Gorsuch, and
Justice Kavanaugh.
   The Chief Justice said:
   “I have the honor to announce, on behalf of the Court, that the Octo-
ber 2019 Term of the Supreme Court of the United States is now
closed, and the October 2020 Term is now convened.
   “Today's orders of the Court have been duly entered and certifed,
and fled with the Clerk.
   “I note that memorial drapery has been erected on the door of our
courtroom and on the Bench to signify mourning for Justice Ruth
Bader Ginsburg, who died on September 18, 2020. Justice Ginsburg was
born in Brooklyn, New York, March 15, 1933. She received her B. A.
from Cornell University and married Martin D. Ginsburg shortly after
graduation. They briefy lived in Oklahoma, where Marty was stationed
when called to active duty in the Army. They both pursued a career in
law. She attended Harvard Law School and received her LL.B. from
Columbia Law School in 1959, tied for frst in her class.
   “Justice Ginsburg served as a law clerk to the Honorable Edmund L.
Palmieri, Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, from 1959 to 1961. From 1961 to 1963, she was a
research associate and then associate director of the Columbia Law

   “Justice Ginsburg was a professor of law at Rutgers University
School of Law from 1963 to 1972, and Columbia Law School from 1972
to 1980. In 1971, she was instrumental in launching the Women's Rights
Project of the American Civil Liberties Union. She argued six signif-
cant gender discrimination cases in this Court, winning fve.
   “President Carter appointed Justice Ginsburg to the United States
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and she served
there as a Circuit Judge from 1980 to 1993. President Clinton appointed
her to this Court in 1993. She was the second woman appointed to the
Court and served more than 27 years. During her time on the Court,
she authored 483 majority, concurring, and dissenting opinions.
   “Justice Ginsburg's contributions as advocate, jurist, and citizen are
immeasurable. We at the Court will remember her as a dear friend and
treasured colleague.

  “Justice Ginsburg is survived by her two children: Jane Carol Gins-
burg and James Steven Ginsburg; four grandchildren; two step-grand-
children; and one great-grandchild. We extend our condolences to her
children, extended family, and countless admirers.
  “At an appropriate time, the traditional memorial service of the
Court and Bar will be held in our Courtroom.
  “We now turn to the business of the Court.”

                       Order in Pending Case
   No. 20A55. Marci Andino, et al., Applicants v. Kylon Middleton, et al.
Application for stay presented to The Chief Justice and by him re-
ferred to the Court granted in part, and the district court's September
18, 2020 order granting a preliminary injunction is stayed pending dis-
position of the appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the
Fourth Circuit and disposition of the petition for writ of certiorari, if
such writ is timely sought. Should the petition for writ of certiorari be
denied, this stay shall terminate automatically. In the event the peti-
tion for writ of certiorari is granted, the stay shall terminate upon the
sending down of the judgment of this Court.
   The order is stayed except to the extent that any ballots cast before
this stay issues and received within two days of this order may not be
rejected for failing to comply with the witness requirement.
   Justice Thomas, Justice Alito, and Justice Gorsuch would grant the

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

   Present: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Thomas, Justice Breyer, Jus-
tice Alito, Justice Sotomayor, Justice Kagan, Justice Gorsuch, and Jus-
tice Kavanaugh.

                       Order in Pending Case
  No. 20A34. Food and Drug Administration, et al. v. American Col-
lege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, et al. The Government seeks
a stay of an injunction preventing the Food and Drug Administration
from enforcing in-person dispensation requirements for the drug mife-
pristone during the pendency of the public health emergency. The Gov-
ernment argues that, at a minimum, the injunction is overly broad in
scope, given that it applies nationwide and for an indefnite duration
regardless of the improving conditions in any individual State. Without
indicating this Court's views on the merits of the District Court's order
or injunction, a more comprehensive record would aid this Court's re-
view. The Court will therefore hold the Government's application in
abeyance to permit the District Court to promptly consider a motion
by the Government to dissolve, modify, or stay the injunction, including
on the ground that relevant circumstances have changed. See Febre v.
United States, 396 U. S. 1225, 1225–1226 (1969) (Harlan, J., in cham-
bers); see also Parr v. United States, 351 U. S. 513, 520 (1956). The
District Court should rule within 40 days of receiving the Govern-
ment's submission.
  Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas joins, dissenting.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

   Present: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Thomas, Justice Breyer, Jus-
tice Alito, Justice Sotomayor, Justice Kagan, Justice Gorsuch, Justice
Kavanaugh, and Justice Barrett.

                       Order in Pending Case
   No. 155, Original. Texas, Plaintiff v. Pennsylvania, et al. The State
of Texas's motion for leave to fle a bill of complaint is denied for lack
of standing under Article III of the Constitution. Texas has not demon-
strated a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another
State conducts its elections. All other pending motions are dismissed
as moot.
   Statement of Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas joins: In my
view, we do not have discretion to deny the fling of a bill of complaint
in a case that falls within our original jurisdiction. See Arizona
v. California, 589 U. S. ––– (Feb. 24, 2020) (Thomas, J., dissenting). I
would therefore grant the motion to fle the bill of complaint but would
not grant other relief, and I express no view on any other issue.

for the Seventh Circuit denied.
  Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Kagan joins, dissenting from
the denial of certiorari and application for stay.

tions, Petitioner v. George Russell Kayer. On petition for writ of certio-

riam. Justice Breyer, Justice Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan dissent.

   No. 20–524. Yi Tai Shao, Petitioner v. John G. Roberts, Jr., Chief
Justice, Supreme Court of the United States, et al. Petition for writ of
certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit. Because the Court lacks a quorum, 28 U. S. C. § 1,
and since the qualifed Justices are of the opinion that the case cannot
be heard and determined at the next Term of the Court, the judgment
is affrmed under 28 U. S. C. § 2109, which provides that under these
circumstances "the court shall enter its order affrming the judgment
of the court from which the case was brought for review with the same
effect as upon affrmance by an equally divided court." The Chief Jus-
tice, Justice Thomas, Justice Breyer, Justice Alito, Justice Sotomayor,
and Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of
this petition.

                Certiorari—Summary Dispositions
   No. 19–8695. Ruben Gutierrez, Petitioner v. Luis V. Saenz, et al.
The motion of petitioner for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and
the petition for writ of certiorari are granted. The June 12, 2020 order
of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit granting
the motion to vacate the stay of execution previously issued by the
United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas is va-
cated. The case is remanded to the Court of Appeals with instructions
to remand the case to the District Court for further and prompt consid-
eration of the merits of petitioner's underlying claims regarding the
presence of a spiritual advisor in the execution chamber in light of the
District Court's November 24, 2020 fndings of fact. Although this
Court's stay of execution shall terminate upon the sending down of the
judgment of this Court, the disposition of the petition for a writ of
certiorari is without prejudice to a renewed application regarding a
stay of execution should petitioner's execution be rescheduled before
resolution of his claims regarding the presence of a spiritual advisor in
the execution chamber.

tice Alito, Justice Sotomayor, Justice Kagan, Justice Gorsuch, Justice
Kavanaugh, and Justice Barrett.

   No. 20A136 (20–746). South Bay United Pentecostal Church, et al.,
Applicants v. Gavin Newsom, Governor of California, et al. Application
for injunctive relief presented to Justice Kagan and by her referred to
the Court is granted in part. Respondents are enjoined from enforcing
the Blueprint's Tier 1 prohibition on indoor worship services against
the applicants pending disposition of the petition for writ of certiorari.
Application denied with respect to the percentage capacity limitations,
and respondents are not enjoined from imposing a 25% capacity limita-
tion on indoor worship services in Tier 1. Application denied with re-
spect to the prohibition on singing and chanting during indoor services.
This order is without prejudice to the applicants presenting new evi-
dence to the District Court that the State is not applying the percent-
age capacity limitations or the prohibition on singing and chanting in
a generally applicable manner. Should the petition for writ of certiorari
be denied, this order shall terminate automatically. In the event the
petition for writ of certiorari is granted, the order shall terminate upon
the sending down of the judgment of this Court.
  Justice Thomas and Justice Gorsuch would grant the application in

capacity restrictions on indoor worship services and the prohibition
against indoor singing and chanting, and would stay for 30 days an
injunction against the percentage attendance caps and the prohibition
against indoor singing and chanting. Justice Alito would have the stay
lift in 30 days unless the State demonstrates clearly that nothing short
of those measures will reduce the community spread of COVID–19 at
indoor religious gatherings to the same extent as do the restrictions
the State enforces with respect to other activities it classifes as
essential.

tice Alito, Justice Sotomayor, Justice Kagan, Justice Gorsuch, Justice
Kavanaugh, and Justice Barrett.

                       Order in Pending Case
   No. 20A138. Gateway City Church, et al., Applicants v. Gavin New-
som, Governor of California, et al. Application for injunctive relief pre-
sented to Justice Kagan and by her referred to the Court granted pend-
ing disposition of the appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit and disposition of the petition for writ of certiorari,
if such writ is timely sought. The Ninth Circuit's failure to grant relief
was erroneous. This outcome is clearly dictated by this Court's decision
in South Bay United Pentecostal Church v. Newsom, 592 U. S. –––
(2021). Should the petition for writ of certiorari be denied, this order
shall terminate automatically. In the event the petition for writ of cer-
tiorari is granted, the order shall terminate upon the sending down of
the judgment of this Court.
   Justice Kagan, with whom Justice Breyer and Justice Sotomayor
join, dissenting: I dissent for the reasons set out in South Bay United
Pentecostal Church v. Newsom, 592 U. S. ––– (2021) (Kagan, J.,
dissenting).

                             Per Curiam
  No. 20–940. Alaska, Petitioner v. Sean Wright. On petition for writ
of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Cir-
cuit. Petition for writ of certiorari granted. Judgment vacated, and case
remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit

                Certiorari—Summary Disposition
   No. 20–746. South Bay United Pentecostal Church, et al., Petitioners
v. Gavin Newsom, Governor of California, et al. Petition for writ of
certiorari granted. Judgment vacated, and case remanded to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit for further con-
sideration in light of Tandon v. Newsom, 593 U. S. ––– (2021) (per
curiam).

                     Orders in Pending Cases
  No. 20A150. Texas, et al., Applicants v. Cook County, Illinois, et al.
In 2019, the Department of Homeland Security promulgated through
notice and comment a rule defning the term “public charge.” The Dis-
trict Court in this case vacated the rule nationwide, but that judgment
was stayed pending DHS's appeal to the United States Court of Ap-
peals for the Seventh Circuit. On March 9, 2021, following the change
in presidential administration, DHS voluntarily dismissed that appeal,
thereby dissolving the stay of the District Court's judgment. And on
March 15, DHS relied on the District Court's now-effective judgment
to remove the challenged rule from the Code of Federal Regulations
without going through notice and comment rulemaking. Shortly after
DHS had voluntarily dismissed its appeal, a group of States sought
leave to intervene in the Court of Appeals. When that request was
denied, the States fled an application for leave to intervene in this
Court and for a stay of the District Court's judgment. The States argue
that DHS has prevented enforcement of the rule while insulating the
564                       MONDAY, APRIL 26, 2021

District Court's judgment from review. The States also contend that
DHS has rescinded the rule without following the requirements of the
Administrative Procedure Act. We deny the application, without preju-
dice to the States raising these and other arguments before the District
Court, whether in a motion for intervention or otherwise. After the
District Court considers any such motion, the States may seek review,
if necessary, in the Court of Appeals, and in a renewed application in
this Court. Justice Barrett took no part in the consideration or decision
of this application.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

   Present: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Thomas, Justice Breyer, Jus-
tice Alito, Justice Sotomayor, Justice Kagan, Justice Gorsuch, Justice
Kavanaugh, and Justice Barrett.

                        Opinions Per Curiam
   No. 20–391. Jody Lombardo, et al., Petitioners v. City of St. Louis,
Missouri, et al. On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States
Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The Court expresses no view
as to whether the offcers used unconstitutionally excessive force or,
if they did, whether Gilbert's right to be free of such force in these
circumstances was clearly established at the time of his death. The
Court instead grants the petition for certiorari, vacates the judgment
of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, and re-
mands the case to give the court the opportunity to employ an inquiry
that clearly attends to the facts and circumstances in answering those
questions in the frst instance. Opinion per curiam. Justice Alito, with
whom Justice Thomas and Justice Gorsuch join, dissenting.
   No. 20–1212. Peyman Pakdel, et ux., Petitioners v. City and County
of San Francisco, California, et al. On petition for writ of certiorari to
the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Petition for
writ of certiorari granted. Judgment vacated, and case remanded to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit for proceedings
consistent with the opinion of the Court. Opinion per curiam.

   Present: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Thomas, Justice Breyer, Jus-
tice Alito, Justice Sotomayor, Justice Kagan, Justice Gorsuch, Justice

   IT IS ORDERED that the Court's orders of March 19, 2020 and April

tions set forth below.
   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, in any case in which the relevant
lower court judgment, order denying discretionary review, or order
denying a timely petition for rehearing was issued prior to July 19,
2021, the deadline to fle a petition for a writ of certiorari remains
extended to 150 days from the date of that judgment or order. In any
case in which the relevant lower court judgment, order denying discre-
tionary review, or order denying a timely petition for rehearing was
issued on or after July 19, 2021, the deadline to fle a petition for a writ
of certiorari is as provided by Rule 13.
   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the requirement of Rule 33.1 that
40 copies of documents be submitted in booklet format will go back
into effect as to covered documents fled on or after September 1, 2021.
For submissions pursuant to Rule 33.2, the requirement of Rule 39 that
an original and 10 copies be submitted, where applicable, will also go
back into effect as to covered documents fled on or after September 1,
2021. The authorization to fle a single copy of certain documents on
8½ x 11 inch paper, as set forth in the Court's April 15, 2020 order, will

tronically in cases governed by Rule 34.6, although other types of docu-
ments in those cases should be fled in paper form only.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

   Present: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Thomas, Justice Breyer, Jus-
tice Alito, Justice Sotomayor, Justice Kagan, Justice Gorsuch, Justice
Kavanaugh, and Justice Barrett.

                       Order in Pending Case
   No. 21A21. Joseph R. Biden, Jr., President of the United States,
et al., Applicants v. Texas, et al. Application for stay presented to Jus-
tice Alito and by him referred to the Court denied. The applicants have
failed to show a likelihood of success on the claim that the memoran-
dum rescinding the Migrant Protection Protocols was not arbitrary and
capricious. See Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of Univ.
of Cal., 591 U. S. ––– (2020) (slip op., at 9–12, 17–26). Our order denying
the Government's request for a stay of the District Court injunction
should not be read as affecting the construction of that injunction by
the Court of Appeals.
   Justice Breyer, Justice Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan would grant
the application.

     No. 21–5592. John H. Ramirez, Petitioner v. Bryan Collier, Execu-
tive Director, Texas Department of Criminal Justice, et al. The parties
                        FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 2021                  781
are directed to submit briefs that address whether petitioner ade-
quately exhausted his audible prayer claim under the Prison Litigation
Reform Act, 42 U. S. C. § 1997e(a). The parties are also directed to ad-
dress whether petitioner has satisfed his burden under the Religious
Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA) to dem-
onstrate that a sincerely held religious belief has been substantially
burdened by restrictions on either audible prayer or physical contact.
The parties are further directed to address whether the government
has satisfed its burden under RLUIPA to demonstrate its policy is the
least restrictive means of advancing a compelling government interest.
Finally, the parties are directed to address the type of equitable relief
petitioner is seeking, the appropriate standard for this relief, and
whether that standard has been met here. See Hill v. McDonough, 547
U. S. 573, 584 (2006) (setting forth a four-factor test for equitable re-
lief). The parties may address other relevant issues, avoiding repetition
of discussion in prior briefng.

preme Court of the United States, Amy Coney Barrett. I would like to

sion which has been issued to the Honorable Amy Coney Barrett as
an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. The
Commission has been duly signed by the President of the United States
and attested by the Attorney General of the United States. I move
that the Clerk read the Commission and that it be made a part of the
permanent record of the Court.”

cute and fulfll the duties of that offce according to the Constitution

offce with all the powers, privileges, and emoluments to the same of
right appertaining unto her, the said Amy Coney Barrett, during her
good behavior.
  “In testimony whereof, I have caused these letters to be made patent
and the Seal of the Department of Justice to be hereunto affxed.
  “Done at the City of Washington this 26th day of October in the year

that I will administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal
right to the poor and to the rich, and that I will faithfully and impar-
tially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon me as Asso-
ciate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States under the
