Gentlemen of the Bar: It gives me the profoundest sorrow to
state the severance which has taken place of those ties of personal
affection and respect which united us to our brother, Mr. Justice
Lamar, caused by his untimely death last night. And this sorrow
I know is shared by his brethren of the Bar, to whom he was so
strongly and devotedly attached, and will. I am confident, be par-
ticipated in by all his countrymen as they come to feel that the
country will be for the future deprived of the blessings which would
have come from the future discharge of his duties as a member of
this court with that conspicuous ability and enlightened devotion
to duty so clearly manifested during the period which has gone
by since he took up his duties here this day five years ago.
The funeral ceremonies will take place at his home in Augusta,
Ga., on Wednesday next. Mr. Justice Van Devanter, Mr. Justice
( Pitney, and Mr. Justice McReynolds will, as a committee appointed
by the court, attend the funeral as its representatives. As a mark

fee for preparing it for the printer and supervising fee, and other
probable fees, and upon application therefor shall furnish the same
to the party docketing the case. If such estimated sum be not paid
within 90 days after the cause is docketed, it shall be the duty of the
clerk to report that fact to the court, and thereupon the cause will be
dismissed, unless good cause to the contrary is shown.
"9. When the record is filed, or within 20 days thereafter, the
plaintiff in error or appellant may file with the clerk a statement
of the points on which he intends to rely and of the parts of the
record which he thinks necessary for the consideration thereof, with
proof of service of the same on the adverse party. The adverse
party, within 30 days thereafter, may designate in writing, filed with
the clerk, additional parts of the record which he thinks material;
and, if he shall not do so, he shall be held to have consented to a hear-
ing on the parts designated by the plaintiff in error or appellant.
If parts of the record shall be so designated by one or both of the
parties, the clerk shall print those parts only; and the court will
consider nothing but those parts of the record and the points so
stated. If at the hearing it shall appear that any material part of
the record has not been printed, the writ of error or appeal may be
dismissed or such other order made as the circumstances may appear
to the court to require. If the defendant in error or appellee shall
have caused unnecessary parts of the record to be printed, such order
as to costs may be made as the court shall think proper.
"The fees of the clerk under rule 24, section 7, shall be computed,
as at present, on the folios in the record as filed, and shall be in full
for the performance of his duties in the execution hereof."
These amendments shall go into effect May 1, 1916.

counsel for the appellants.
The Attorney General addressed the court as follows: May it
please your honors, for the second time within a year it has become
my duty and sad privilege to present to you resolutions passed by the
bar on the death of a member of this court.
Upon the former occasion I paid an inadequate tribute to one
who had been a friend from my youth. It was not my privilege to
come in intimate contact with the late Justice Lamar until a very few
years before his death, and yet the feeling which moves me most is
one of keen personal loss, a feeling that a great light has gone out,
not merely one that illumined the legal shadows but one that warmed
the hearts of men and made them kinder, nobler, and more charitable.
In recalling the personality of a really great man who has left
us we do not see him as a combination of various intellectual and
moral qualities. On the contrary, we remember him as the possessor
of some one striking characteristic, which, like Saul, son of Kish,
towered above its brethren and challenged the attention of all ob-
servers.

259
While Justice Lamar was a powerful advocate, a wise counselor,
an able and just judge, a cultured gentleman, and a great citizen,
his dominating characteristic was a peculiarly winning courtesy, a
kindly consideration for all with whom he came in contact. He was
born and bred among a people who have always cherished this qual-
ity, and yet in his case it was not the result of association and train-
ing. By a perfectly natural process he garnered the sunshine of life
and dispensed it with a prodigal hand.
In contemplating a life like this you think of Hawthorne's tribute
to the fragrant white water lily of the Concord River, of how he
marveled at its capacity for absorbing only loveliness and perfume;
and we reflect, as did the author, on how some persons assimilate
only what is ugly and evil from the same moral circumstances which
supply good and beautiful results-the fragrance of celestial flowers-
to the daily lives of others.
The power to see, to appreciate, to absorb, and to express what is
good comes from the heart, and this man, like Abou Ben Adhem,
would have said to the angel with the golden book, "Write me as
one that loves his fellow men."
I doubt not that it was because of this marked characteristic that
Justice Lamar was selected by the President in the summer of 1914
from all the able men of the Nation, to represent the United States
at the conference called by Argentina, Brazil, and Chile, to consider
the delicate Mexican problem. Surely no more critical situation
could have arisen to test to the utmost the best qualities of heart and
mind. He approached its consideration carrying in his right hand
gentle peace to silence envious tongues," and no such mission was
ever more successfully carried out.
Being a man of this type, and of strong intellect and wide learn-
ing, he naturally brought to the study of questions of abstract law
a sympathetic interest and enthusiasm which made even the dry
bones live again. He was never satisfied with his work while any
possibility of further effort remained. Where others would have
rested content, his ardent zeal for perfect accomplishment spurred.
him to continued labor. Accuracy, simplicity, and clearness of ex-
pression were his constant aim and his marked achievement.
In appraising the work of his professional brethren he was most
generous. He took intense pleasure in the accomplishments of
others, and often pronounced their work "well done" with genuine
enthusiasm where he would have criticized it if his own.

Joseph Rucker Lamar was the son of Rev. James S. Lamar and
Mary Rucker Lamar. His family was of Huguenot descent, the
founder, Thomas Lamar, having settled in Maryland in 1663. His
ancestors moved to Georgia in 1755 and have taken a prominent part
in the public life of the State.
After attending preparatory schools in Georgia he matriculated
at the State University in 1874, but before graduating entered
Bethany College, W. Va., of which Dr. William King Pendleton,
afterwards his father-in-law, was president. He graduated from
this institution in 1877, and after studying law at Washington and
Lee University was, on April 16, 1878, admitted to the bar in
Augusta, Ga., where he opened an office and established his home.
On January 30, 1879, he married Miss Clarinda Huntington Pendle-
ton, who, with two sons, survives him.
The society of Augusta has always been cultured, and young
Lamar was from early manhood one of the most charming of that
delightful circle, and rapidly became one of the leading spirits in
the social and civic life of the community.
From 1886 through 1889 Mr. Lamar represented Richmond
County, in which Augusta is situated, in the Georgia Legislature.
He was the author of some of the most important legislation of his
State, notably the act regulating the exercise of the right of eminent
domain and the laws governing voluntary assignments.
Shortly after ending his legislative services he was appointed one
of the codifiers who revised and edited the Code of Georgia of 1895.
His labors on this commission were most able and of great service to
the State.
Meanwhile his practice had become wide and varied, ar extended
throughout Georgia and neighboring States. There were few cases
of great magnitude in that section in which he was not employed.
On January 13, 1903, the governor appointed Mr. Lamar a justice
of the Supreme Court of the State to fill a vacancy on that bench,
and he was elected to the position in 1904. He resigned in the spring
of 1905 and returned to the practice of law at Augusta.
He was the author of a number of historic and literary contribu-
tions, many of which are to be found in the printed volumes of the
reports of the Georgia Bar Association, of which he was an active
member.
Except while on the State bench, he served as a member of the
board of law examiners for admission to the bar of Georgia from the
organization of that institution until his appointment as a member
of this court. He was chairman of this board from the spring of
1905 until his removal to Washington.

261
On December 12, 1910, he was nominated by President Taft to be
an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, was
confirmed by the Senate on December 15, and took his seat on Jan-
uary 3, 1911.
His services on the bench of this court are well known. During
the five years of its duration, he participated in the decisions of
1,179 cases, wrote the opinion of the court in 114 and the dissenting
opinion in 8. His opinions are found in volumes 220 to 238, inclu-
sive, of the United States Reports. His sound judgment, wide learn-
ing, and great clearness and facility of expression won for him the
confidence and admiration of the bar and the public.
Perhaps the most important opinions rendered by Justice Lamar
were in the cases of United States v. Grimaud (220 U. S. 506);
Gompers et al. v. Bucks Stove & Range Company (221 U. S. 418);
United States v. Midwest Oil Company et al. (236 U. S. 459) ; United
States v. Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad Company and
Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Coal Company (238 U. S. 516).
In United States v. Grimaud, the Secretary of Agriculture had
passed an order forbidding grazing on public lands without permits.
The defendants were charged with violating this order and contended
that the act of Congress making it an offense to disobey the regula-
tion of the Secretary was unconstitutional in that it attempted to
delegate legislative authority. The decision overrules this conten-
tion.
In the case of Gompers et al. v. Bucks Stove & Range Company,
plaintiffs in error were charged with contempt in violating an in-
junction of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia by pub-
lication of an "unfair" list. It was held that the publication was a
contempt, but that the proceedings were not properly brought.
The case of United States v. Midwest Oil Company et al., was
brought to test the Government's right to oil lands valued at many
millions of dollars, and involved the authority of the President to
withdraw such lands from public entry. It was decided that the
President had this authority.
United States v. Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad Com-
pany and the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Coal Company
arose under the commodity clause of the act to regulate commerce
and under the antitrust act. The railroad company at the time of
the passage of the commodity clause was engaged in mining, buying,
transporting, and selling anthracite coal. To divest itself of title
before transportation began, it caused the coal company to be organ-
ized with stockholders and officers in common with itself. The
railroad company then caused the output of its mines to be trans-
ferred to the coal company under a contract which placed the latter
company largely, if not completely, within the power of the former.

262
The district court dismissed the petition. The Supreme Court re-
versed this decision, holding that by reason of having stockholders
and officers in common and by reason further of the above-men-
tioned contract, the two companies were so united in ownership and
management as to give the railroad company an interest in the coal
of the coal company, and that, therefore, the transportation of such
coal by the railroad company constituted a violation of the com-
modity clause. The court also held that the contract in question
violated the antitrust act.
In 1911 Yale University, in recognition of his learning and
ability, conferred on Justice Lamar the degree of doctor of laws.
He was active in many spheres of public work in the communities
in which he lived, and in the Christian Church, of which he was a de-
voted member.
He died in this city on January 2, 1916, having just entered upon
his fifty-ninth year. He was in the zenith of his powers and useful-
ness when seized with the fatal illness which terminated his life.
Such, in brief outline, is the skeleton of this man's character and
life. It conveys no idea of his vivid personality. It faintly portrays
his kindly nature and the loving service to country, family, and
friends bereft.
Beyond their admiration for his talents and accomplishments will
stand foremost with all privileged to know him their recollection of
his warm, magnetic nature.
Strong, ardent, a man among men, a warrior in every battle for
truth and right, always ready for every conflict which would advance
the cause he espoused, he was one of whom it could with perfect
truth be said:
His life was gentle, and the elements
So mix'd in him, that Nature might stand up
And say to all the world, "This was a man!"
RESOLUTIONS.
Resolved, That the members of the bar of the Supreme Court of
the United States lament the untimely death of the late Joseph
Rucker Lamar, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United
States, and record their appreciation of his learning, ability, and
high character, the affectionate regard with which they now cherish
his memory, and the great loss to the bench and the country occa-
sioned by his death.
A native Georgian, he was born of an illustrious family, and by his
life's work not only sustained the best traditions thereof but added
lustre to the great name he bore. He was the second of the Georgia
Lamars to win a place on the bench of the Supreme Court of the
United States, the first being the late L. Q. C. Lamar, appointed from

263
the State of Mississippi. Each of these two Lamars brought to the
court superb mental equipment, lofty ideals, intense Americanism
and consecration to duty, and by the product of his labors more than
vindicated the wisdom of his appointment.
Joseph Rucker Lamar was born October 14, 1857, and after a
collegiate education came to the bar at 21 years of age. His entire
life thereafter was one of devotion to the law, for he never knew any
other field of labor.
As a practitioner at the bar he won renown and success, and, at a
comparatively early age, easily ranked among the leaders of the
bar of his State. As an antagonist he was always formidable, for he
was always prepared, but he was also always delightful. His
courtesy was disarming. He was always fair, and neither sought
nor would he have any mean advantage.
In 1892 he was chosen as one of three commissioners to codify the
laws of his State and the work he there did, resulting in the code
of 1895, will ever stand as a monument to his discriminating judg-
ment, to his industry, and to the thoroughness and completeness
with which he performed each task assigned to him.
Prior to this work of codification he served for two terms as a
member of the lower house of the General Assembly of Georgia, and
to the legislative field he carried the training and habits of the lawyer,
giving to his State, upon all public questions, the careful preparation,
the thoughtful consideration, the sound advice and unswerving loy-
alty of attorney to client. He was always earnest, always sincere
and never knew but one way to discharge any duty, and that way was
to discharge it to the very best of his ability.
On January 13, 1903, he took his seat as an associate justice of the
Supreme Court of the State of Georgia, and resigned therefrom in
1905 on account of his health and resumed the practice of law.
The fruits of this service were found in the affection and admira-
tion for him of his associates on the bench, and of the bar of the
State, and in strong virile opinions, classically expressed, which
to-day, as then, enrich the permanent judicial literature of his State.
On December 12, 1910, he was appointed an associate justice of the
Supreme Court of the United States. His appointment was shortly
thereafter confirmed by the Senate, and on January 3, 1911, he took
his seat on the bench. He died at his home in the city of Washington
on January 2, 1916, not quite completing five years of service.
From the day upon which he entered this service he consecrated his
life and all that was in him to the faithful performance of its duties.
His application, his untiring research, his painstaking care and his
patient labor were known to all who had dealings with the court.
Others have been and no doubt will be permitted to give more years
of service to their country on this great bench than was he, but to

264
him was given the high privilege, by excessive and never-ending toil,
to give his life. No man could give more.
Measured by time, his service was not long, but measured by results,
a great service was completed. He served long enough to demonstrate
his aptitude and fitness for the work, and long enough to leave upon
the archives of his country the enduring impress of a great and just
judge.
His life was one of devotion to American ideals. He was ever a
student of his country's history, and no man was more familiar than
he with the origin of the Government under which he lived or with
the foundation principles upon which it rests. The extent and the
limitations of its power were clearly defined in his mind, and full
well he knew how liberty came and how only it can be preserved.
To the office of Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the
United States he brought the ability, the strength, the courage, and
the patriotism to preserve our Republic as the fathers founded it,
and all these he dedicated to that great end.
In May, 1914, he was invited by the President to serve as a special
commissioner of the President, in connection with commissioners
from certain South American countries, in the matter of mediation in
the troubled affairs of our neighboring Republic of Mexico. With
his habitual response to every call of duty he accepted the invita-
tion and assumed the responsibilities thereby imposed. The com-
missioners so selected met with commissioners from Mexico at Niagara
Falls soon after their appointment, and concluded their delicate and
important labors in the month of July following, to the satisfaction
of the several governments participating.
He was by nature kind and gentle, but beneath his kindliness of
manner there was a fixedness of purpose and a courage of steel that
knew no yielding. He was cautious and careful, but once the path of
duty became clear he followed it to the end. He never faltered in
the pursuit of truth.
The sweetness and gentleness of his nature, the charm of his per-
sonality, the readiness of his sympathy, were such that to know
him was to love him. The same listening ear that as judge he gave
to advocate he always kept attuned to hear the voice of humanity.
He loved his fellows, and to him the breath of friendship was as
incense. It sweetened, inspired, and strengthened his life.
In the rich fullness of his sympathetic heart, when he came to pre-
pare his last will and testament, in 1899, he incorporated therein the
following beautiful statement:
My friendships many and precious I leave to my family in the hope that they
will be cherished and continued. I know of no enmities; but if such unhappily
hereafter arise, let them be forgotten.

265
When the end came for him, it is precious to believe that there was
still an absence of all enmities and that he went out into the great
beyond leaving behind him a world of friends only. What more
priceless heritage could he have bequeathed?
Resolved, That the Attorney General be asked to present these
resolutions to the court, with the request that they be entered upon
the records and that the chairman of this meeting be directed to
forward a copy of them to the family of the late Justice Lamar, ac-
companied by an expression of our profound sympathy for them
in their overwhelming bereavement.
The Chief Justice responded:
Mr. Attorney General, there is nothing to be added to the beautiful
tribute which the resolutions of the bar, so appreciatively by you
presented, pay to the memory of Mr. Justice Lamar. As I grasp
their ultimate signifiance they are intended principally to express
the appreciation by his brethren of the bar of his fealty to the noble
ideals of the profession and of the honor which his life and work
have reflected on that profession. In fact, while expressing the
profound regret which the death of Mr. Justice Lamar has occa-
sioned, as I understand the resolutions, they seek not simply to
express that regret but rather, as it were, to lay the foundations in
the permanent records of this court of a monument to his memory
which shall continue to speak of his great moral and mental qualities,
of his courageous and conscientious discharge of judicial duty, long
after we ourselves shall have gone.
Admirable as are these aims of the resolutions, I find it difficult
to completely adjust myself to them. Ah, how can it be otherwise,
since at the very mention of the death of our brother Lamar all
sense of exultation or pride at the high ideals to which his life con-
formed fades out of my thoughts and there remains only the sense
of personal sorrow at the loss occasioned by the severance of those
ties which were so cherished and by which his brethren were bound
to him-a sorrow whose depth can not be fully fathomed without
the knowledge begotten by association in judicial work of the attri-
butes of his nature, so gentle, so true, so faithful, so brave, so gen-
erous, so devoted! But controlling personal feelings, let me en-
deavor to bring myself into harmonious relations with the purposes
of the resolutions by making some few suggestions as to impressions
made upon me by his work on this bench and pointing out the domi-
nant intellectual influences which, in my opinion, formed and con-
trolled his abstract conceptions as to some important questions, and
which consequently tended to shape the conclusions which he reached
in the discharge of his duties concerning such questions.

266
Too young to have been a participant in the Civil War, he was
yet old enough to have appreciated the anguish of that appalling
conflict, the multitude of noble lives on both sides which were for-
ever stilled, the homes made desolate, the fields wasted, and the
blight of a destroyed society and of nearly all prosperity which
came, at least, in one section, as a result of that struggle-impres-
sions which in the very nature of things indelibly stamped upon his
developing life the dread consequences which necessarily would fol-
low in the wake of a disintegrated union and a destroyed national
life. He was, moreover, old enough to have understood and appre-
ciated the anguish, more appalling than the calamity of the war, of
the period which followed in its wake, and thus to have also im-
pressed upon his nature beyond the possibility of forgetfulness the
destruction of individual right which would arise from reducing the
States to mere dependent vassals deprived of local autonomy and
to be governed from afar by a centralized government, whether of
executive power or of bureaucratic authority. Thus indubitably,
my belief is, it resulted that when by training his mind came to ex-
plore the sources of our constitutional life, his opinions came to be
composite; that is, in his mind there resulted, as it were, a fusion
of State and National power, united but not destroyed, both coop-
erating to the perpetuation of the other. In other words, his
opinions came by a natural process to embody the very concepts
upon which our institutions must rest.
Reared virtually in the atmosphere of an agricultural community,
when by the force of his ability he came in later life to consider
wider range that is, the relation to each other of diverse and seem-
ingly conflicting activities and the possibility of coordinating and
preserving them all-it also seems to me clear that the process which
had shaped his convictions as to our constitutional government came
to mold his opinions on the subjects just stated. In other words,
he came fully to appreciate that to assume a society resting solely
upon the pursuit of agriculture and which would be confined to that
relation was a negation of the existence of society itself, which in its
very essence embodies the complex resultants of all the activities of
human life, giving rise to the corresponding duty to harmonize and
adjust them to each other so that they all might live and develop
for the blessing and advancement of mankind.
In practice it may be said that these ultimate convictions were
applied by Mr. Justice Lamar in his discharge of judicial duty in a
threefold aspect: First, the relation of the activities of individuals
and their results to each other; second, the relation between the
power of the States and that of the Nation; and, third, the obligation
and effect of the limitations imposed upon all government as the con-

sequence of those great guarantees in favor of individual right
forming an inherent part of our constitutional system. As to the
first, it is enough to say that the opinions expressed by Mr. Justice
Lamar in the performance of his duties here afford apt examples of
the keenness of his appreciation of the duty to adjust between con-
flicting activities so as to preserve the rights of all by protecting the
rights of each. As to the second, intensely local as were his affec-
tions and his ties, nothing is more clearly portrayed by his work on
this bench than the broad conception which he entertained of the
duty to uphold and sustain the authority of the Union as to the
subjects coming within the legitimate scope of its power as conferred
by the Constitution. As to the third, no demonstration could be
more complete than that afforded by his work of the fixed opinion on
his part as to the duty to uphold and perpetuate the great guaran-
tees of individual freedom as declared by the Constitution, to the end
that the freedom of all might not pass away forever. Convinced
as he was from his study of the sources of our constitutional institu-
tions that their enjoyment was dependent upon the limitations in
favor of individual right which the Constitution expressed, and that
such limitations were essential to secure us from the anguish and
turmoil and tyranny and the disappearance of freedom which had
always resulted where such guarantees did not exist or were not
adhered to, he had come to feel that for the purpose of their preser-
vation he was but a trustee for the millions who were to come. His
mind was too penetrating to listen for a moment to the suggestion
that freedom would be secured by destroying principles which were
essential to its preservation or that wrong would result unless truths
which were eternal were violated. Thus controlled, his work on this
bench leaves no room to doubt that no thought of mere expediency,
no mere conviction concerning economic problems, no belief that
the guarantees were becoming obsolete or that their enforcement
would incur popular odium ever swayed his unalterable conviction
and irrevocable purpose to uphold and protect the great guarantees
with every faculty which he possessed. In considering such questions
there shone ever in his heart the light of Georgia firesides and the
great duty he owed to those firesides, indeed, to every individual, not
only in Georgia but elsewhere, to see to it that by no act of his did
the inherent principles of individual freedom guaranteed by the
Constitution fail to receive enforcement or their efficacy become
impaired by misconception or misrepresentation.
O true American and devoted public servant, O cherished friend
and faithful comrade, O sweet and noble soul, may it be vouchsafed
that the results of your work may endure and fructify for the preser-
