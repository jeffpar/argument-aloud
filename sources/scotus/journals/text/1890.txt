Mr. Attorney-General Miller addressed the court.
MAY IT PLEASE THE COURT: On the 13th day of October last, Sam-
uel Freeman Miller, Senior Associate Justice of this court, died at the age
of seventy-four years.
At a meeting of the bar of this court, on the 6th instant, the following
resolutions touching his death were adopted:
Resolved, That the members of the bar, practicing in the Supreme Court
of the United States, are affected with profound sensibility at the loss
suffered by the court and by the profession of the law and the community
at large which has fallen upon them in the sudden death of this eminent
lawyer, jurist, and magistrate when at the height and full exercise of his
great powers in the service to the nation in the exalted place which he had
so long occupied.
Resolved, That the length of years, falling not much short of a whole
generation, which the judicial service of Mr. Justice Miller has given to
the administration of justice in the high functions and the wide scope which
belong to the great tribunal in which he sat, and the period of the service
concurring with the march of events in the life of the nation through the
civil war, and the difficult tasks of the restoration of order and unity in
the working of our Government and the reëstablishment of the calm and
prevalent maintenance of law throughout the land, place him in the front
rank and in close association with the greatest judges that have shed luster
upon the court in its historic fame and permanent benefits upon the wel-
fare of the people.
Resolved, That the members of this bar, besides fully sharing in the
universal and grateful public estimate of the character and life of this
great judge and grief at his loss, may properly, from their close and con-
stant observation of his personal traits and his relations with the court
and the bar in his discharge of his daily duties, bear witness to his admir-
able conduct in these duties and relations, so just, so firm, so amiable, and
feel a personal sorrow at his death.
Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be presented by the presi-
dent and secretary of the meeting to the family of Mr. Justice Miller
with the sincere sympathy of the profession in their bereavement and that

62
the Attorney-General be requested to present to the Supreme Court in ses-
sion the proceedings of this meeting.
MAY IT PLEASE THE COURT:
It was a saying of Solon, the lawgiver, that no one ought to be called
happy until after death, since storms and calamities in the evening may
change the character of the brightest day. Tried by this supreme test,
Samuel Freeman Miller was a happy man.
Born of pioneer stock amid humble surroundings in the simple life of
Kentucky during the second decade of this century, a life from which
advancement could be had only along the rugged paths of frugality,
integrity, and hard work, he was fortunate in the time and place of his
nativity.
It is not uncommon to refer to a successful man as having started with-
out extraneous help, as if this rendered the career more remarkable.
Quite the reverse is true. To the unambitious youth, content upon the
plains of comfortable mediocrity, wealth and influence may be desirable.
But one who aspires to the high places of earth, to climb mountains,
and from their summits take in wider landscapes, to be a leader among his
fellows, must generally strive under the spur of necessity, along paths im-
passable to luxury.
In this, also, Mr. Miller's life was happy. Necessity compelled, and
an indomitable resolution impelled him to make his own way.
Full of ambition, though having only slight educational advantages,
he chose medicine as a profession, and practiced as a physician successfully
in Kentucky for a number of years.
Dissatisfied, however, with his surroundings, especially hating the con-
taminating touch of African slavery, he determined to seek a new life,
changing at once his residence and his profession.
In 1862, President Lincoln found Mr. Miller in Iowa, as a few years
before the country had found Mr. Lincoln in Illinois, devoting his life to
a somewhat obscure and unremunerative, though, for the place and time,
successful practice of the law.
And the finding of such a judge by the President was only less fortu-
nate than the finding of such a President by the country.
Indeed, Mr. Justice Miller rightly thought it one of the happiest in-
cidents of his life that he not only received his commission as Justice of
this court at the hands of Abraham Lincoln, but that he received with it
his friendship and confidence; and well he might, for who does not feel a
pride that he was even a contemporary of that great and good man, and
who does not view with regret the severance of any tie connecting that in-
estimable life with his own?

While we may take by the hand those who have lived and wrought by
the side of Lincoln, we seem to be near him, and as by personal contact
to take on something of the high inspiration and holy impulses of his
character.
Alas, that but a single strand now connects him with the personality of
this court. One member only remains, full of years and honors, dis-
charging the high duties to which he was consecrated by the martyred
President.
Serus in cœlum redeas.
Mr. Justice Miller was happy in his work and in its results.
To be appointed to a seat in this great tribunal was a signal mark of
distinction; but to occupy that seat, in the estimation of the profession and
of the whole people, for nearly thirty years, with the highest credit to
himself and the greatest usefulness to his country, was honor indeed.
When Justice Miller ascended this bench, a political earthquake was
shaking the foundations of Government, obliterating old landmarks,
and filling the accustomed channels of public law with hitherto un-
suspected difficulties and dangers. To safely guide this, the weakest and
most sensitive branch of the Government, amid these shocks and through
all the troublous times that followed, so that, on the one hand, no just
power of the General Government should be lost, and on the other, no just
right of a State or of a citizen should be sacrificed, was a task worthy
of the best efforts of the greatest jurists, and worthily has the work been
done. It is not disparagement to others to say, that in this work, which
will ever stand as a monument of honor to the court, and a bulwark of
security to free institutions, Justice Miller was second to none.
The most striking feature of his mind was the logical faculty. Others,
perhaps, had more culture, more legal learning; none had more legal wis-
dom. Intellectually, as morally, he was robust, rugged, simple, and
always honest. With him, logical conclusions were moral convictions, and
to abide by them was an intellectual and moral necessity. Like Martin
Luther at the Diet of Worms, he could "do no otherwise." Undiscrimi-
nating eulogy has said that Judge Miller was wont to sweep away the law
in order that justice might prevail.
Such a statement would not have been accepted by him as praise. He
loved justice, but he knew, as all men fit for judges know, that justice,
humanely speaking, can have its perfect work only through the law; that
obedience to law by the magistrate, as well as by the private citizen, is
essential to justice, as it is a condition of liberty.
In his social and home life also, our friend was happy. A vigorous,
healthy constitution in a stalwart body, a genial temperament, a great

64
fondness for and unfaltering trust in his friends, made the grasp of his
hand always hearty and his presence a delight in every social gathering.
His religious views were broad and very practical. The essence of his
creed was "to do justice, to love mercy, and to walk humbly" before God
and man.
In the Odyssey, the much-suffering Ulysses, thus describes the highest
earthly bliss:
"There is no better, no more blessed state,
"Than when the wife and husband in accord
"Order the household lovingly. Then those
"Refine who hate them, those who wish them well
"
Rejoice, and they themselves the most of all."
After a long life of such domestic felicity and of such public usefulness,
loved by a multitude of friends, revered of all men, our friend, still
instant in duty, with length of days in his right hand and in his left hand
wisdom and honor, awaited the call of the Master. The call came, sudden,
peremptory, and it found him ready.
I move that the resolutions of the bar be spread upon the records of the
court.
The Chief Justice responded as follows:
The court profoundly sympathizes with the resolutions and the remarks
of the Attorney-General. The loss so universally felt in the death of Mr.
Justice Miller comes home in an especial degree to his brethren, partici-
pants in his toil and sharers of his intimate friendship.
When he became a member of the court its deliberations were presided
over by Chief Justice Taney, and Catron and Nelson and Grier and Clif-
ford were among his associates, together with the venerable Wayne, the
last survivor of the bench as constituted under John Marshall. Of the
forty-five Associate Justices up to the time of his death only Catron equaled,
and Washington, William Johnson, Story, McLean, and Wayne exceeded
him in length of service. We need not say how cordially we reciprocate
the wish that our colleague, his ancient comrade, may be spared to pass
far beyond that limit, while we extend the aspiration to that other vet-
eran who has sat in judgment with him for more than twenty years.
The trans-Mississippi country had just entered upon its course of unex-
ampled development when the sagacity of Mr. Lincoln gave to it, in this
appointment, a judicial representative. Wisconsin was one of the States
of the circuit to which Mr. Justice Miller was first allotted, but was after-
wards detached, while Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, and Missouri remained
with him from the beginning to the end, Arkansas, Colorado, and Ne-
braska being subsequently added; and there is no part of that vast and
powerful region that is not full of his labors. He lived to see a popula-
tion in his circuit of three million expand into ten (two of the States ad-
mitted to the Union years after the commencement of his incumbency ris-
deep

65
ing from the 63,000 of 1860 to the million and a half of 1890), while an
equally marvelous increase in the products of the farm and of the mine,
in commerce, in science, in invention, and in wealth, corresponded with
the progress of the great nation of which he was a judicial officer.
He came here in the prime of life, in the full vigor of his faculties, and
with a mind trained by the experience of active practice in two professions,
nearly ten years in that of medicine and fifteen at the bar; a practice in
either requiring for success learning, knowledge of men and things, acute-
ness, and, above all, the habit of decision.
When he took his seat the country was in the throes of internecine con-
flict; when his eyes closed it was upon a happy, prosperous, and united
people, living under the form of government devised by the fathers, the
wisdom of whose fabric the event had vindicated. Great problems
crowded for solution; the suspension of the habeas corpus; the jurisdic-
tion of military tribunals; the closing of the ports of the insurrectionary
States; the legislation to uphold the two main nerves, iron and gold, by
which war moves in all her equipage; the restoration of the predominance
of the civil over the military authority; the reconstruction measures;
the amendments to the Constitution, involving the consolidation of the
Union, with the preservation of the just and equal rights of the States-
all these passed in various phases under the jurisdiction of the court, and
he dealt with them with the hand of a master.
While he took his full share in the consideration of every subject of
judicial investigation, notably in reference to some, as, for instance, those
pertaining to the public lands, yet he chiefly distinguished himself in the
treatment of grave constitutional questions, which brought into play the
patience, the intuition, the deliberation, the foresight, the intellectual grasp,
and the breadth of view, which characterize all who have deserved the name
of statesmen. And as with private controversies, so with those concerning
the public and the Government, he sought to go by the ancient ways, and
never to incur the curse denounced on him who removeth the landmarks.
His style was like his tread, massive but vigorous. His opinions, from
his first in the second of Black's Reports, to his last in the one hundred
and thirty-sixth United States, some seven hundred in number (including
dissents), forming a part of seventy volumes, were marked by strength of
diction, keen sense of justice, and undoubting firmness of conclusion.
He had that true legal instinct which qualified him to arrive at the very
right of a cause and to apply settled principles to its proper disposition;
while to courage was joined an integrity and simplicity that always com-
manded respect and generally carried conviction. Benignant in tempera-
ment, and with a heart full of sensibility, his intercourse with his fellows
was so cordial and kindly as to endear him to all who came within the
sphere of his influence.
m
Thr

66
And the power of routine so benefited him that through the long years of
experience, which seem so brief now, he attained, as was remarked of Mans-
field, "that dignity of disposition which grows with the growth of an
illustrious reputation, and becomes a sort of pledge to the public for
security."
The classical allusion of the Attorney-General might well receive a wider
application, for, to the last, having seen and known much of men, of
councils and of governments, himself "not least, but honored of them
all,” he bent to the oar, seeking to explore new lines of coast along the
well-nigh illimitable ocean of the law.
His last years were suffused with the glow of the evening-time of a life
spent in the achievement of worthy ends and expectations, and he has
left a memory dear to his associates, precious to his country, and more
enduring than the books in which his judgments are recorded.
The court has heretofore adjourned as a mark of respect to the memory
of the deceased, and a delegation from its number has attended the com-
mittal of his body to its connatural dust in the distant city from whence
he came, among the people to whom he was so deeply attached, who with
their fellow-countrymen had followed his career with pride and affection,
and by whom his final resting-place will ever be held sacred.
The resolutions of the bar and the remarks of the Attorney-General
will be entered upon the record, and it is ordered that the memorials of
the bars of New York, of St. Louis, of Portland, Oregon, and of the east-
ern and western districts of Arkansas be placed on file, together with such
other commemorative tributes as may be hereafter received.

of error or appeal shall be allowed until such assignment of errors shall

jection of evidence, the assignment of errors shall quote the full substance
of the evidence admitted or rejected. When the error alleged is to the
charge of the court, the assignment of errors shall set out the part referred
to totidem verbis, whether it be in instructions given or in instructions re-
fused. Such assignment of errors shall form part of the transcript of the
record, and be printed with it. When this is not done counsel will not

cording to this rule will be disregarded, but the court, at its option, may

within his circuit, or by any district judge within his district, and the
proper security be taken and the citation signed by him, and he may also
grant a supersedeas and stay of execution or of proceedings, pending such
writ of error or appeal.
2. Where such writ of error is allowed in the case of a conviction of an
infamous crime, or in any other criminal case in which it will lie under
said sections 5 and 6, the circuit court or district court, or any justice or
judge thereof, shall have power, after the citation is served, to admit the
accused to bail in such amount as may be fixed.
RULE 37.
Cases from circuit court of appeals.
