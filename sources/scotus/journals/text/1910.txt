SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES.
MONDAY, OCTOBER 10, 1910.
The court met pursuant to law.
Present: Mr. Justice Harlan, Mr. Justice White, Mr. Justice
McKenna, Mr. Justice Holmes, Mr. Justice Day, Mr. Justice Lurton,
and Mr. Justice Hughes.
Mr. Justice Harlan, Presiding Justice, said:
"Gentlemen of the Bar: Since the last term the Honorable Charles
Evans Hughes has been appointed an associate justice of this court
to fill the vacancy occasioned by the death of Mr. Justice Brewer.
Mr. Hughes is present and prepared to take the required oath of
office. The court extends a most cordial welcome to the new member.
The clerk will read his commission and administer the oath.”
The clerk then read the commission and Mr. Hughes took the oath
of office and was escorted by the marshal to his seat on the bench.
Mr. Justice Harlan continued:
"Gentlemen of the Bar: Since its last session this court has sus-
tained a very great loss. The earthly career of the Chief Justice has
been closed by death. This sad event occurred on the 4th day of July
of the present year at his summer residence, after nearly twenty-
three years of continuous and distinguished service on this bench.
He met the final summons with that calmness of spirit and compo-
sure of mind that marked his whole life. From his early manhood
he walked in the good way, uprightly before God and his fellow-men,
and passed from this life into the life beyond the grave in the con-
fident belief, I doubt not, that the Maker and Ruler of the Earth
ordereth all things aright. This court, indeed the nation, will miss
him, but the memory of his stainless life will ever remain with his
countrymen as a priceless heritage.
"The regular call of the docket will be commenced to-morrow. No
formal business will be transacted by the court to-day. All motions
and applications noticed for to-day will then be heard."
The Presiding Justice then announced that, out of respect for the
late Chief Justice, the court would now adjourn until to-morrow at
the usual hour.
Adjourned until to-morrow at 12 o'clock.

"SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES,
"Washington, D. C., November 23, 1910.
"DEAR BROTHER MOODY: We can not let you leave us without an
expression of our deep regret. The too few years during which we
sat together on the bench already had confirmed the prophecy of your
arguments at the bar. They had proved that your unusual powers
would be applied as faithfully and impartially to dispassionate decision
as, when you were Attorney General, they had been devoted to an
always lofty presentation of a side. We grieve that the country so
soon should lose services that it ill can spare and we companionship
in which affection was joined to respect. But you have left a sample
of your work in the reports, and, we believe, have earned the great
reward that the wise and good of the future, as well of the present,
will say it was well and nobly done.
"JOHN M. HARLAN.
"E. D. WHITE.
"JOSEPH MCKENNA.
"OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES.
"WILLIAM R. DAY."
"We came to the bench of the Supreme Court after Brother Moody
was compelled by sickness to lay aside active public work. But we
have knowledge of his course of life, and of his judicial opinions, and
concur most cordially in what is said in the above letter by those of
his associates who served with him on the bench.

"MY DEAR BRETHREN: I can not let your letter go unanswered,
but at this time I am unable fittingly to say more than that your
words reach deep in my heart and mind and awaken there an intense
gratitude to you all. With the expression of this and of my respect
and affection for each individual member of the court, I must be
content.
"Most sincerely, yours,

Mr. Attorney General Wickersham presented to the court the fol-
lowing resolutions:
Resolved, That the members of the bar of the Supreme Court desire
to express their profound regret at the death of Melville Weston
Fuller, eighth Chief Justice of the United States, and to record their
high appreciation of his life and character and of his conspicuous and
faithful service to his country.
Born in the State of Maine, he went to Chicago at the age of twenty-
three, when that great city was in its infancy, and there entered upon
his long and distinguished professional career, which culminated in
his elevation to the most exalted judicial station in our Government.
He secured the advantages of an academic and classical education
at Bowdoin College, and always retained the habits and tastes of the
student and scholar.

89
He was a man of the most extensive and varied reading in the
profession, in governmental and political discussion and in general
literatu e.
He rapidly achieved a commanding position at the then exception-
ally brilliant bar of the city of his adoption, and for thirty-two years
carried on an extended and diversified practice in the courts of his
State; nor did he infrequently appear before the great tribunal over
which he afterwards, and for twenty-two years, presided with such
marked ability and distinction.
He was a man of singular beauty and purity of character.
While he was at the bar no one harbored a suspicion that the exi-
gency of forensic controversy, in which he was almost constantly
engaged, could ever tempt him to aught that was unfair or unworthy
of the highest ideals of a noble and honorable profession.
As Chief Justice it is enough to say that with conspicuous fidelity
he fully and consistently maintained the best traditions of that high
office. He took a deep interest in the efforts to secure peace between
nations by international arbitration, and was appointed by our Gov-
ernment to membership in the permanent court established in 1899 by
the First Peace Conference, and served in that capacity.
His character was marked by a gentle courtesy and consideration
which constantly illuminated and attended upon the discharge of his
important public duties, always marked his relations with the bar,
and earned that popular confidence which goes out to him whom the
people believe to be a merciful and considerate as well as a just and
impartial judge.
All this he was; and, endowed by nature with talents not inferior
to those of his predecessors, possessed of attainments, training, and
experience adequate to the exacting requirements of his great office,
he filled it at all times in such a manner as to command the admira-
tion and respect of the bar and the grateful appreciation of his
countrymen.
On the morning of July 4 last, at his beautiful summer home, on
the soil of the State in which he was born, and to which he remained
always deeply attached, his long, useful and honorable life ended;
and when the sad announcement was made, we who had practiced in
the great tribunal where he so long presided felt a deep sense of per-
sonal loss and personal bereavement that he had gone from us forever.
Resolved also, That the Attorney General be asked to present these
resolutions to the court and to request that they be inscribed upon its
permanent records.
And that the chairman of this meeting be requested to transmit a
copy of the resolutions to the family of the late Chief Justice and an
expression of our sincere sympathy with them in the great and irrep-
arable loss which they have sustained.

The Attorney General then said:
"On the last day of the last term of this court Chief Justice Fuller,
responding to resolutions of the bar and observations in commemora-
tion of Mr. Justice Brewer, spoke sadly of the procession of his breth-
ren who had passed before him to their reward. 'They were all men
of marked ability, of untiring industry, and of intense devotion to
duty, but they were not alike. They differed "as one star differeth
from another in glory."
"
"A few days later, and he too joined that procession, leaving but
one survivor of that body of great judges--Miller, Field, Bradley,
Harlan, Matthews, Gray, Blatchford, and Lamar-over which he was
called to preside, when he succeeded Chief Justice Waite in October,
1888.
"The oldest members of this court,' said Mr. Justice Miller in
speaking of Chief Justice Waite, ‘know of no one who was better
fitted to discharge the administrative duties of the office of its Chief
Justice, or who ever did so with more acceptability to his associates
and to the public at large.' (126 U. S., Appx.)
"Mr. Waite's successor was to fully earn a like encomium. He
was peculiarly well fitted to the discharge of those duties. As the
presiding officer and spokesman of the court, during his long incum-
bency, his gentle, dignified bearing and kindly, considerate manner
won for him the sympathetic appreciation of the bar and the respect
and affection of his associates.
6
Campbell wrote of Lord Eldon, ‘Among his qualifications for the
judgment seat must be reckoned his fine temper and delightful
manners.'
***
"These attributes in a judge are entirely consistent with the posses-
sion of a discriminating intellect, clear perceptions, and decisiveness
of character. They tend to the preservation of that relation of
cordial respect which must exist between bench and bar in order that
the court may get from the bar the advantage of clear, temperate,
candid statement, and the bar may feel assured of patient hearing and
thorough comprehension by the court. The life of a justice of this
court is one of unremitting toil. The creation of the circuit courts
of appeals in 1891 afforded it but a temporary relief. Only by the
most arduous labor has the court been able to keep measurably
abreast of the business which the expanding exercise of Federal
power has brought upon its dockets. The period of Chief Justice
Fuller's incumbency was one of unprecedented national growth.
Even the twenty years following the Civil War did not give rise to
the great number and variety of new questions which have been
pressed upon the court since the year 1888.

91
"The attempts to solve by legislation economic questions resulting
from our industrial growth, of which the income-tax law, the bank-
ruptcy law of 1898, the acts concerning carriers in interstate com-
merce, the law against unlawful trusts and monopolies, the meat-
inspection laws, the food and drugs act, the tea-inspection law and the
oleomargarine laws, the Chinese-exclusion acts and the other immigra-
tion and naturalization laws are illustrative, have required this court
to construe and apply with patient study and statesmanlike compre-
hension the principles of the Federal Constitution in the effort to pre-
serve inviolate the dual nature of our governmental system, not hesi-
tating to assert the paramountcy of the National Government over
those subjects where the Constitution declares it to be supreme, nor
check the usurpation by Federal authority of those powers which, not
being expressly or by implication delegated to the General Govern-
ment, are reserved to the States respectively or to the people.' The
War with Spain made us a world power and brought to the decision of
this court novel questions as to the relations of our Government to
territory acquired by conquest or purchase. In dealing with all of
these great questions Chief Justice Fuller played no inconsiderable
rôle. During his twenty-two years of service he wrote eight hundred
and twenty-nine opinions, of which but twenty-nine expressed the
views of a minority of the court. He wrote the opinion of the court
in the Behring Sea cases (In re Cooper, 143 U. S., 472); in the first
case arising under the Sherman antitrust law (U. S. v. Knight, 156
U. S., 1), and in one of the latest, the so-called Danbury hatter's case
(Loewe v. Lawlor, 208 U. S., 274); in the income-tax cases (Pollock v.
Farmers Loan and Trust Co., 157 U. S., 429; 158 U. S., 601); in
Kansas v. Colorado (185 U. S., 135); in the case arising under the first
safety-appliance law (Johnson v. Southern Pacific Co., 196 U. S., 1);
and in the contempt proceedings against the sheriff of Chattanooga,
Tenn., and his deputies (U. S. v. Shipp, 215 U. S., 580).
"He wrote dissenting opinions in In re Neagle (135 U. S., 1), the
case in which it was held that petitioner, a deputy United States mar-
shal, was justified in killing an assailant of a justice of this court whom
he had been detailed to protect from violence; in the case of Mormon
Church v. United States (136 U. S., 1), where he denied the power of
Congress to enact the law of February 19, 1887, repealing the charter
of the Mormon Church and directing legal proceedings to be taken to
wind up its affairs and dispose of its property; in The Chinese Exclu-
sion case (Fong Yue Ting v. U. S., 149 U. S., 698), and in the case of
United States v. Wong Kim Ark (169 U. S., 649), where the court
held that a child of Chinese parents born in the United States became
at birth a citizen of the United States; in The Lottery case (188 U. S.,
321); in The Insular cases (Dooley v. U. S., 183 U. S., 151); in Hale v.

92
Henkel (201 U. S., 43); and he concurred with Mr. Justice White in
his dissent in The Northern Securities case (193 U. S., 197).
"It is difficult to select from the great volume of Chief Justice
Fuller's contributions to the work of this court those of his opinions
which best illustrate the extent of his learning and the nature of his
acumen without unduly extending these remarks.
"Chief Justice Fuller's opinions are all characterized by a simple
lucidity of statement and a directness of reasoning free from subtlety.
His mind naturally tended to resist the broadening application of
Federal control over subjects which until recent years had been left
entirely to State regulation.
666
* * *
"In my opinion,' he wrote, in the Mormon Church case (136 U. S.,
1, 67), 'Congress is restrained, not merely by the limitations expressed
in the Constitution, but also by the absence of any grant of power,
expressed or implied in that instrument.
I regard it of
vital consequence that absolute power should never be conceded as
belonging under our system of government to any one of its depart-
ments. The legislative power of Congress is delegated and not
inherent, and is, therefore, limited. I agree that the power to make
needful rules and regulations for the Territories necessarily compre-
hends the power to suppress crime; and it is immaterial even though
that crime assumes the form of a religious belief or creed. Congress
has the power to extirpate polygamy in any of the Territories by the
enactment of a criminal code directed to that end; but it is not author-
ized under the cover of that power.to seize and confiscate the property
of persons, individuals or corporations, without office found, because
they have been guilty of criminal practices.
"The doctrine of cy pres is one of construction and not of admin-
istration. By it a fund devoted to a particular charity is applied to a
cognate purpose, and if the purpose for which this property was
accumulated was such as has been depicted it cannot be brought
within the rule of application to a purpose as nearly as possible
resembling that denounced. Nor is there here any counterpart in
congressional power to the exercise of the royal prerogative in the
disposition of a charity. If this property was accumulated for pur-
poses declared illegal, that does not justify its arbitrary disposition by
judicial legislation. In my judgment, its diversion under this act of
Congress is in contravention of specific limitations in the Constitution,
unauthorized, expressly or by implication, by any of its provisions,
and in disregard of the fundamental principle that the legislative power
of the United States as exercised by the agents of the people of this
Republic is delegated and not inherent.'
"The Chief Justice wrote the opinions of the court in deciding a
number of controversies between States of the Union (Kansas v. Col-
orado, 185 U. S., 125; Virginia v. West Virginia, 206 U. S., 290;

93
Louisiana v. Mississippi, 202 U. S., 1), and in the prize cases which
resulted from the Spanish War (The Carlos F. Roses, 177 U. S., 655;
The Pedro, 175 U. S., 354; The Benito Estenger, 176 U. S., 568; the
Manila Prize Money, 188 U. S., 254; the Infanta Maria Theresa, 188
U. S., 283). In the case of Ponce v. Roman Catholic Church (210
U. S., 296), by an interesting historical review, he sustained the proposi-
tion that the Roman Catholic Church in Porto Rico was a juridical per-
son, whose property was entitled to protection under the terms of the
treaty between the United Staates nd Spain.
"The Talmud compares the study of the law to a huge heap of dust
that is to be cleared away. "The foolish man says, "It is impossible
that I should be able to remove this immense heap. I will not attempt
it." But the wise man says, "I will remove a little to-day, some more
to-morrow, and more the day after, and thus in time I shall have
removed it all."" It was in this spirit that Chief Justice Fuller toiled
during the years that he presided over this court. Much of the work
of all courts is of but transitory importance, save in so far as it keeps
ever burning the sacred lamp of justice to lighten the footsteps of
men. But the labors of this tribunal are essential to the preservation
of the liberties of a free people. In the largest proportion of causes
submitted to its judgment every decision becomes a page of history,
and may become part of a rampart against anarchy. To this court
men look for the maintenance of those rights which our forefathers
wrung from a reluctant monarch at Runnymede eight hundred years
ago, which are now embodied in the Constitution of the United States,
and which are as essential to the protection of the citizen against the
tyranny of a hydra-headed tyrant of the future as they were against
the monarchs of the past.
"The labors of the eighth Chief Justice are over, and his work in
this court is submitted to the judgment of men. As he said of Justice
Brewer, 'He died suddenly, but not the unprepared death from which
we pray to be delivered,' and having finished his course in faith he
doth now rest from his labors."
The Chief Justice responded:
"MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL: The resolutions which you present are
consoling, since they show how poignantly our brethren of the bar
share with us the sorrow caused by the death of our cherished and
venerated Chief Justice. When the shadow which the bereavement
resulting from his loss casts upon the path of duty which lies before
us is considered the resolutions are additionally consoling, since they
strengthen our conviction that, whatever may be our infirmities, we
may always rely upon the generous judgment of our brethren of the
bar if only we bring to the discharge of our duties the singleness of

94
purpose which ever characterized the judicial labors of our late Chief
Justice.
"Those labors find an enduring memorial in the reported decisions
of the court rendered during the long period of his service. Their
potency, whether in enforcing and protecting individual right or in
perpetuating representative government by upholding our constitu-
tional institutions, have passed beyond the influence of praise or blame.
They have become the heritage of his countrymen, for whose good he
labored with untiring devotion.
"The darkness of the valley of the shadow of death yet so obscures
vision as to render it impossible for me to attempt now to fix the result
of the labors of the Chief Justice or to define with accuracy the scope
of the blessings to his countrymen and to mankind which have arisen
from his work. I therefore do not attempt to supplement the brief
statement on that subject which you, Mr. Attorney General, have so
eloquently made. So, also, I shall forbear to comment upon the wide
attainments of the late Chief Justice, his engaging literary fancy, his
great familiarity with precedents, and his grasp of fundamental princi-
ples. I leave these special attributes, as well as the wider considera-
tions which would be required to be taken into view in order to
symmetrically analyze the judicial work of the late Chief Justice, not
only because some other occasion would be more appropriate and some
more masterful hand than mine be required to do justice to those
subjects, but also because my purpose now is only briefly to refer to
some of the more endearing and admirable personal traits of the Chief
Justice which were manifested to those associated with him in judicial
labor, and at the same time to mark the attributes from which those
traits were derived and sustained.
66
Briefly, those qualities were his untiring attention to his judicial
duties and the dedication which he made to the efficient and wise per-
formance of those duties of every intellectual and moral power which
he possessed; his love of justice for justice's sake; his kindness, his
gentleness, associated, however, with a courage which gave him always
the power to fearlessly do what he thought was right, without fear or
favor. The source whence these endearing and noble qualities were
derived was not far to seek. It was faith in the power of good over
evil; faith in the capacity of his fellow men for self-government; faith
in the wisdom of the fathers of our institutions; faith, unshaken faith,
in the efficiency of the system of constitutional government which
they established and its adequacy to protect the rights and liberties of
the people. And, above all, there was an abounding faith in Divine
Providence, the faith of a Christian, which dominated his being and
welded all his faculties into an harmonious whole, causing his nature
to be resonant with the melody of hope and charity, which made him
what he was--a simple, kindly, generous, true, brave, and devoted

95
public servant, treading with unswerving step the path of duty, until
the tender voice of the All-Wise and Merciful Father called him from
labor to rest, from solicitude to peace, and to his exceeding and
enduring reward.
"Mr. Attorney General, the resolutions of our brethren of the bar
will be made a part of the records of the court. In making this order,
the thought comes unbidden to the mind that if there be in the future
by either the bench or the bar a failure to discharge duty because of
the want of an honest effort to do so, the resolutions will become the
test of our moral insufficiency and be a relentless instrument for our
condemnation. But the shadow created by these misgivings is at once
dispelled by our conviction that although the Chief Justice has gone
before, yet doth he speak to us by his precept and example, which I
can not refrain from thinking will be a beacon leading both bench and
bar to a perfect dedication of all their powers to the complete dis-
charge of their whole duty. Ah! In the luminosity afforded by that
example and precept and with the benign vision given by that faith
which is the proof of things unseen may the hope not be indulged in
that the result of such a consecration to duty will enable us to behold
a continued righteous administration of justice, a preservation of our
constitutional government, the fructification of all the activities of our
vast country for the benefit of the whole people, the abiding of tran-
quility and happiness in all the homes of all our land, and the con-
tinued enjoyment by all our countrymen of individual liberty restrained
from license and safeguarded from oppression.
"The resolutions of the bar and the remarks of the Attorney General
