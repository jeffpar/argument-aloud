THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES,
Washington, D. C., October 24, 1922.
DEAR BROTHER CLARKE: Your resignation as a member of this
court during the vacation has delayed a joint expression of our
sincere regret at parting with you as a colleague.
Service as a Federal judge in the lower courts had fitted you
quickly to put your shoulder to the wheel here. The number and
excellence of your opinions, contained in the 12 volumes from 242
to 258, inclusive, of our reports, testify to the debt the country owes
you for the share you have had in carrying the great burden that
rested upon this court during the period of the Great War and the
years immediately preceding and following it.
We shall miss much of your earnest and constant application,
your kindly and loyal spirit of companionship, and your generous
courtesy. We wish to assure you of our affectionate regard and
respect for you as a man and a public servant.
You still have, we hope, many years of usefulness before
best wishes go with you.
Sincerely yours,
Hon. JOHN H. CLARKE,
Youngstown, Ohio.
WILLIAM H. Taft.
JOSEPH McKenna.

OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES.

YOUNGSTOWN, OHIO, November 13, 1922.
MY DEAR MR. CHIEF JUSTICE: The joint expression of friendship
and regard of my former brethren of the court which you send me is
very grateful, and I am sure you all know that I fully and sincerely
reciprocate the feeling. The recollection of the unvarying kindness
of you all to me-the one thing I miss and the loss of which I feel-
will always be one of the most precious possessions of my life.
It seemed best for me to resign my office while I still had strength
sufficient to take up other duties, but I shall watch the work of you
all with interest and sympathy, confident from my intimate asso-
ciations with you that the great tradition of the court for learning,
independence, and impartial decision will be abundantly maintained.

MONDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 1922.
87
Even here I can not withhold the expression of the hope that the
bill pending in Congress to modify the imperative statutory juris-
diction of the court may soon become a law, so that you may not be
so burdened with unimportant cases as you now are, and so may
have more time and strength for the consideration of the many
causes of great public concern constantly coming before you, the deci-
sion of which is so fateful to our country.
Wishing for each one of you the health and strength so necessary
to the discharge of your high duties, I am,
Sincerely yours,
Hon. WILLIAM H. TAFT,
Chief Justice of the United States,
JOHN H. Clarke.

DECEMBER 23, 1922.
DEAR BROTHER DAY: At the end of twenty-five years of judicial
work you have retired to enjoy a well-earned respite from unre-
mitting labor. This you began by one year's service on the bench of
your native State. After a short but conspicuously useful and suc-
cessful service as Secretary of State during the Spanish War and as
chairman of the Peace Commission which negotiated the treaty of
Paris closing that war, you went back to judicial work on the Cir-
cuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit for four years, whence
you were called to this court in March, 1903. The thorough prepara-
tion you had had for effective work here manifested itself at once.
Your service has covered two decades. Your opinions appear in
sixty-seven volumes of our reports. But it is not only in the pub-
lished opinions, their number, their clearness, and their force, great
as they are, that the value of your service is to be measured. We
who have sat with you in conference know how much you have con-
tributed to our counsels from your wealth of judicial experience,
your accurate knowledge of the scope of our previous decisions, and
your remarkable familiarity with the adjudged limits of our juris-
diction.
We shall miss much your loyalty to the court and its traditions,
your affectionate fellowship, your wit and humor, and your unfailing
tranquillity and good sense.
Your separation from the court is a real personal sorrow to us,
and we know that it is to you. To end such a close and confidential
relation in a high, arduous, and common service to the State and
country extending over many years, must be this when there has ever
been present mutual respect and affection.
We sincerely hope that in your retirement and in a long evening of
life you may find your happiness, as well you may, in your extended
and honorable record of public service and in the clear verdict of
your countrymen that you have deserved well of the Republic.
Affectionately yours,
WILLIAM H. TAFT.

To the Chief Justice and Associate Justices of the Supreme Court.
MY DEAR BRETHREN: Your kind letter of the 23d instant has been
received. I am very grateful for this expression of your feeling

TUESDAY, JANUARY 2, 1923.
126
toward me on the separation which follows my laying down of judi-
cial work.
I need not say that the labors of nearly twenty years of service
upon the court have been necessarily arduous. They have been,
nevertheless, enjoyable, and the association and companionship of
those with whom they have been performed have been most agree-
able to me, and I part with the court with deep regret that it seems
proper for me to take this step at this time.
I can not forego an expression of satisfaction that at no time has
any serious inroad been made upon the great and necessary functions
of the court in adjudicating fundamental rights under our system
of Government, although such power has been the subject of attack
during the entire life of the Republic. If our institutions are to en-
dure, as I believe they are, these powers must be lodged in an im-
partial and independent tribunal.
That you may live long to carry on the great work entrusted to
you by the Constitution is my heartfelt wish as I sever our official
associations. For each and all of you I have an affectionate regard
and esteem which I shall cherish as long as I shall live.
Cordially and fraternally,
WILLIAM R. DAY.

WASHINGTON, D. C., February 24, 1923.
MY DEAR BROTHER PITNEY: We write to assure you of our sincere
appreciation as a colleague and to express our deep regret that failing
health has compelled you to give up the work which you love. and in
which you have rendered signal service to our country.
After four years in the Federal Congress and three years in the
New Jersey senate, whose presiding officer you were, you became a
justice of the Supreme Court of the State, and ultimately the Chan-
cellor. Your father's distinguished career on the same equity bench
gave you a high standard to follow. With this seven years of legis-
lative training and eleven years of judicial experience, you were called
to our court, fully equipped for its responsible duties.
For ten years you have given unremitting labor to the work of the
court the consideration of cases, the preparation of your own opin-
ions, and the most careful examination and criticism of the opinions
of your colleagues. You have spared yourself in nothing. We can
not but think that you have sacrificed your health in the earnest effort
to do everything possible to further the work of the court. Your
opinions in thirty-four volumes-225 to 259-show a splendid sense
of responsibility, accurate learning, thorough research, able reasoning,
nice sense of justice, and careful preparation.
We shall miss your kindly companionship, your genial courtesy,
your loyalty, and your high sense of judicial duty. Our love follows
you in retirement. May the years to come give you well-earned repose
and happiness.
With affectionate regard, we are,
Sincerely yours,
Hon. MAHLON PITNEY,

WASHINGTON, D. C., March 3, 1923.
MY DEAR CHIEF JUSTICE: Your letter touched me more deeply
than I can tell you. To you, and to my dear brethren of the court,
I owe ten of the happiest years of my life.
Your unvarying kindness, consideration, and helpfulness did
everything to stimulate my ambition to win your esteem; and if
through overwork I have undermined my health, I feel fully repaid
by the appreciation expressed, in your letter, of my usefulness to
the court. It is with the deepest regret that I am compelled to
retire from the bench; but it ever will be a source of consolation
and pleasure to look back upon the days we spent together.
With assurance of my affectionate regards to you all, I am,
Yours fraternally,
Hon. WILLIAM H. TAFT, Chief Justice.
