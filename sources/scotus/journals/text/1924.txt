JANUARY 5, 1925.
DEAR BROTHER MCKENNA: Your active membership in this court
is ending after 27 years. The affectionate and charming intimacy
of that relation is known only to those who have enjoyed it. Few
have been permitted to share it as long as you have. Happy are
you with such a retrospect of love, confidence, and usefulness.
What an extended and varied experience you have had! Going
with your parents to California at the age of 12, you settled in
the Golden State a little more than five years after the arrival of

MONDAY, JANUARY 5, 1925
123
the Forty-niners. Your youth and young manhood were spent in
the atmosphere of that community's irrepressible enthusiasm and
inspiring confidence in its great future.
Admitted to the bar in 1865, twice district attorney of your home
county, for two years its representative in your State legislature,
your upward steps carried you to the National House of Representa-
tives, where during four Congresses you served with distinction.
Put to the test in one of your electoral campaigns, you declined to
yield your convictions on what you deemed sound monetary princi-
ples, and in the face of overwhelming adverse local sentiment, you
carried again your congressional district. You attached your col-
leagues in the House to you by your proved character and won the
admiration and trust of the two great rival Republican leaders of
that day.
Against your inclination, President Harrison induced you to be-
come a Federal circuit judge, and to begin your experience on the
bench with the birth of a tribunal which has since done much to
expedite the administration of national justice-the Circuit Court
of Appeals. Five years you had served there when your former
congressional colleague, William McKinley, called you to his Cabi-
net as Attorney General. Then he appointed you a Justice of this
court.
For more than a quarter century you have borne the burden of
intense judicial labor. More than half that time you have been the
senior Associate Justice. Your opinions, found in 96 volumes of
our reports, 170 to 266, number 633. In them you depart from
conventional wording and adopt a distinctive style of your own,
readily recognized by one familiar with the reports. It is charac-
terized by clearness and force, with a grace of touch and aptness of
phrase that stimulates the reader's interest. An examination of
that array of judgments in cases, many of them of primary public
importance, reveals how much of your trained mental energy, long
experience with men and affairs, judicial and ethical spirit, and
love of country have been poured into them.
Your pride in the court, its high traditions, and its courage has
made deep impression on us who have enjoyed the benefit of your
greater experience, example, and esprit de corps. Your fraternal
nature, your loyalty toward each of us, your tenderness in times of
strain and stress, endear you to us and make us feel deeply sensible
of our loss.
May you have many years of happy and well-earned leisure,
sweetened by thoughts of the affection and high regard of your
associates, and still more by the knowledge of the good you have
wrought in your great and honorable career. Farewell!
Affectionately yours,
WILLIAM H. TAFT.

JANUARY 5, 1925.
MY DEAR CHIEF JUSTICE AND MY DEAR BRETHREN: I thank you
for your expressions of esteem. I accept and appreciate even their
praise as impelled by personal friendship and as a mark of it. They
mitigate the regret—indeed, sorrow-that I feel in separating from
the work of a tribunal so necessary to the existence of a constitutional
government a work whose guiding and prompting considerations
regarded, it has so adequately performed, and it is assured prediction,
will continue to perform.
To this sorrow I shall have the more intimate personal one of a
separation from the companionship of you, my dear Chief and breth-
ren. Here, again, is the mitigation that I shall carry to my retire-
ment, as you so feelingly remind me, abiding reminiscences of it, the
honor conferred, the pleasure it gave. And to it will be added the
recollection of the association with the eminent men who preceded
you in the constitution of the court and its work. May I say in
some emphasis of my service that it was under three Chief Justices-
Chief Justice Fuller, Chief Justice White, and you, my dear Chief,
which is yet in instance, though soon to become a memory.
I conclude, assured by your words of regard, that while our official
relations are this day severed, our personal ones, their pleasure and
honor, to me will be continued.
. With these words of good-bye go my sincere and affectionate
regards.
JOSEPH MCKENNA.

issues, first whether Mrs. Waldman is relieved from the test as to
language because she is a refugee from religious persecution, sec-

affirmed. Opinion by Mr. Justice Brandeis.
No. 13, original. The State of Oklahoma, complainant, . The
State of Texas, defendant: The United States, intervener.
On consideration of the thirteenth report of the receiver herein
the court makes the following orders:
1. The receiver is instructed to pay the net proceeds derived
from well 155 amounting to $4,514.47, to the Kirby Petroleum
Company by way of partly reimbursing it for expense incurred
by it or its predecessor in drilling that well prior to the receiver-
ship such payment to be in full discharge of all possible claims
against the receivership by reason of that work and expense.
2. The receiver is instructed to pay a balance of $1,097.76 out
of the net proceeds of well 156 to the Kirby Petroleum Company
on its claim for expense incurred by it or its predecessor in drilling
that well prior to the receivership-such payment to be in full dis-
charge of all possible claims against the receivership by reason of
that work and expense.
3. Unless within 40 days from this date Tom Testerman shall
accept the moneys directed to be paid to him by paragraph 11 of
the order of June 9, 1924, in discharge of the claim therein described,
he shall be deemed to have abandoned that claim and the moneys
13836-25-50

MONDAY, JANUARY 19, 1925
152
reserved to cover the same shall be paid over by the receiver to the
Secretary of the Interior, as the representative of the United States,
as a part of the net impounded funds derived from the receiver's
operations within the river-bed area. The receiver is instructed
to deliver or transmit forthwith to Tom Testerman a copy of this
order.
4. Unless within forty days from this date the operators who
presented claims for reimbursement out of the proceeds of well
139 (known as the Burke-Senator well) for the cost of drilling
that well prior to the receivership shall adjust the differences be-
tween them and accept reimbursement as contemplated in para-
graph 13 of the order of June 9, 1924, they are directed to show
cause, within five days after the expiration of that period, why
those claims should not be denied and why the moneys reserved
to cover them should not be paid over to the Secretary of the In-
terior, as the representative of the United States, as part of the net
impounded funds derived from river-bed wells. The receiver is
instructed to deliver or transmit forthwith to such claimants copies
of this order.
5. Pursuant to a stipulation made and presented by the con-
flicting claimants thereto, the receiver is instructed to pay the
balance of the net royalty interest in the proceeds of wells 97, 98,
99, 100, 102, 109, and 119 to A. H. Carrigan, as the joint agent
and trustee of such claimants, to the end that he, according to such
stipulation, may deposit such moneys in the First National Bank
of Wichita Falls, Texas, there to be held to await the outcome of
litigation now pending in the courts of Texas to determine the
rights of such claimants in such royalty interest.
6. Pursuant to a stipulation made and presented by the con-
flicting claimants thereto, the receiver is instructed to pay to Rhea
S. Nixon, Receiver of the Southwest Petroleum Company and
trustee of certain claimants, 27 of the net balance of the oper-
ating interest in the proceeds of well 180 (after deducting the
overriding royalty belonging to C. J. Ferguson), and also to pay
to the Security National Bank of Wichita Falls, Texas, 16 of
the said balance 37 to be held by Rhea S. Nixon, as re-
ceiver and trustee, to await the outcome of litigation now pend-
ing in the courts of Texas to determine the rights of those who
are claiming interests therein, and the 16 to be held by the
Security National Bank to await the outcome of litigation now
pending in those courts to determine the rights of those who are
claiming interests therein.

7. The motion of the State of Texas presented January 16,
1925, for leave to file a claim for a royalty or owner's interest in
a part of the impounded funds in the receiver's custody is denied―

MONDAY, JANUARY 19, 1925
153
because, as appears from the receiver's thirteenth report be-
fore mentioned, no claim thereto was presented by that State
within the period prescribed by paragraph 18 of the order of
June 9, 1924, because that period has long since expired, and be-
cause to permit such a claim by the State to be presented and
entertained at this time would unreasonably prolong the receiver-
ship and would be inequitable to other claimants whose claims
were seasonably presented.
8. The several conflicting claims to impounded funds derived
from wells 152, 153, 154, 157, 159, 160, 162, 165, 169, 170, and 172
presented to the receiver under paragraph 18 of the order of June
9, 1924, and reported in his thirteenth report before mentioned, are
referred to Joseph M. Hill, Esquire, of Fort Smith, Arkansas, as a
special master, with directions that such special master take the evi-
dence bearing on such claims and report the same to the court,
together with his findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommen-
dations in the premises, for the ultimate consideration and action of
the court. The evidence shall be taken at Wichita Falls, Texas, and
the taking thereof shall begin February 16, 1925, and shall proceed
with reasonable expedition and be concluded not later than March 7,
1925. The report of the special master shall be filed with the clerk
within thirty days after the evidence is taken, and shall be printed
by the clerk. Claimants shall have fifteen days after the filing of the
report within which to prepare, print, and file exceptions to it,
accompanied by supporting briefs. The special master shall have
authority to issue subpoenas to secure the attendance of witnesses, and
also authority to employ competent stenographic and clerical assist-
ance. Claimants shall be permitted to introduce and use in evidence
any documents or other instruments appearing in the printed records
in this cause without procuring new exemplifications thereof or pre-
senting other proof of their authenticity or identification. The
special master shall receive an allowance covering his actual expenses
and a reasonable compensation for his service. This allowance,
together with the cost of his stenographic and clerical assistance
and the cost of printing his report, shall be charged against and be
borne by the several claimants in such proportions and in such man-
ner as the court hereafter may direct. Each claimant, however,
shall make to the clerk an advance payment of fifty dollars towards
such costs within twenty days from this date; and in default thereof
the claimant shall be deemed to have abandoned his claim.
9. If, before the time fixed for taking evidence under the last
paragraph, the several conflicting claimants to any particular fund
make and present to the receiver a stipulation adjusting their differ-
ences and settling their rights to such fund, or providing that the

MONDAY, JANUARY 19, 1925
154
fund shall be paid over to a trustee of their selection to await an
adjustment or adjudication of their claims through some medium
other than this court, the receiver shall be authorized to give effect
to such stipulation and to pay over the fund as therein provided,
and the stipulation shall operate to withdraw the claims covered by
it from the reference to the special master.

ORDER
Equity Rules 10 and 30 (226 U. S. appendix) are amended hereby
to read as follows:
10
DECREE FOR DEFICIENCY IN FORECLOSURES, ETC.
In suits for the foreclosure of mortgages or for the enforcement
of other liens a decree may be rendered for any balance found to be
due over and above the proceeds of the sale or sales; and execution
may issue for the collection of the same as is provided in rule 8 when
the decree is solely for the payment of money. Such a deficiency
decree may be so rendered and enforced whether the plaintiff owns
the debt or is a trustee or agent for another or others who own it, as
often is true when the debt is evidenced by notes or bonds. Where
the plaintiff is such trustee or agent, any money collected on the
execution shall be paid to him as such representative, and he shall
pay it to the owner of the debt if there be only one, and if there be

more shall distribute it pro rata among them according to their

ANSWER-
-CONTENTS-COUNTERCLAIM
The defendant by his answer shall set out in short and simple terms
his defense to each claim asserted in the bill, omitting mere state-
ments of evidence and avoiding general denials, but specifically ad-
mitting, denying, or explaining the facts upon which the plaintiff
relies, unless he is without knowledge, in which event he shall so
state, and this shall be treated as a denial. Averments other than
those of value or amount of damage, when not denied, shall be
deemed confessed, except as against an infant, lunatic, or other per-
son non compos and not under guardianship, but the answer may
be amended, by leave of the court or judge, upon reasonable notice,
so as to put any averment in issue, when justice requires it. The
answer may state as many defenses, in the alternative, regardless of
consistency, as the defendant deems essential to his defense.
The answer must state in short and simple form any counterclaim
arising out of the transaction which is the subject matter of the suit,
and may, without cross bill, set up any set-off or counterclaim
against the plaintiff which might be the subject of an independent
suit in equity against him, and such set-off or counterclaim, so set up,
shall have the same effect as a cross suit, so as to enable the court
to pronounce a final decree in the same suit on both the original and
the cross claims.
When in the determination of a counterclaim complete relief can
not be granted without the presence of parties other than those to
the bill, the court shall order them to be brought in as defendants if
they are subject to its jurisdiction.

No. 227. Lucy Ward Stebbins and Frank J. Hurley, as Executrix
and Executor, etc., plaintiffs in error, v. Ray L. Riley, Controller of
the State of California. Order: It is ordered by this court that the
opinion heretofore filed be amended by inserting on page 6, line 17,
after the word "estate,” and before the word "passing," the words,
subject to the jurisdiction of the State and." Also by striking out
of the same line the last "the" in the line and substituting the word
"its”; and by striking out of line 18 the words "of the State," so
that the sentence as amended will read as follows: "The incidents
which attach to each as we have observed, may be made the basis of
classification. We can perceive no reason why both may not be made
the basis of classification in a single taxing statute so that the amount
of tax which the legatee shall pay may be made to depend both on
the total net amount of decedent's estate subject to the jurisdiction
of the State and passing under its inheritance and testamentary laws

those laws."
