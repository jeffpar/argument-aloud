ORDERS IN PENDING CASES
No. . School District of Greenville County, etc., et al., petition-
ers, v. Elaine Whittenberg et al. The application for a temporary
stay presented to the Chief Justice, and by him referred to the Court,
is denied.
No. . Edgar D. Whitcomb, Governor of the State of Indiana,
appellant, v. Patrick Chavis et al. The emergency motion to vacate
or modify the stay order of February 2, 1970, is denied. The motion
to advance is denied without prejudice to its renewal following the
filing of the statement as to jurisdiction. Mr. Justice Douglas dissent-
ing from the denial of the motion to vacate or modify the stay order
of February 2, 1970:
"After a trial on June 17 and 18, 1969, a three-judge District Court
entered an order on July 28, 1969, in which it held the multi-member
districting provisions of the present Indiana apportionment statutes
unconstitutional as they applied to Marion County, Indiana. The
State was given until October 1, 1969, to enact statutes redistricting
the State so as to correct the constitutional infirmity. Upon the State's
failure to enact such statutes, the District Court, on December 15,
1969, entered an order establishing legislative districts in the State.
This Court, on February 2, 1970, granted a stay of the District Court's
December 15 order pending the filing and disposition of an appeal
from that order.
"The appellees have now filed a motion to vacate the stay. I would
grant the motion. The constitutionality of the present Indiana appor-
tionment scheme was thoroughly briefed and argued in the three-
judge District Court below. There is no reason to disturb the order
of that court pending the disposition of the appeal by this Court. The
date for the commencement of filing for the November 1970 election
to the General Assembly is February 24, 1970. The State contends that
without a stay it will be forced to conduct the forthcoming election
under the reapportionment plan of the District Court. By granting
the stay, however, this Court has equally forced the appellees to go
through the election under the present scheme which was held uncon-

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Present: Mr. Chief Justice Burger, Mr. Justice Black, Mr. Justice
Douglas, Mr. Justice Harlan, Mr. Justice Brennan, Mr. Justice
Stewart, Mr. Justice White, and Mr. Justice Marshall.
The Chief Justice said:
"Before addressing ourselves to the regular duties of the Court, I
have a privilege accorded me by my colleagues, or I should say six
of them, and it is a privilege which gives me a great, great pleasure.
"This Court commonly does not take note of birthdays of Justices,
but our Brother, Justice Hugo Black, is a very uncommon man. There-
fore, we will break whatever precedents may be in the way to note
today the birthday he will have tomorrow.
"There is no need, of course, to speak of the work of Justice Black
as a member of this Court or his impact on our times and on our coun-
try. That record is written in very nearly 100 volumes of this Court's
United States Reports.
"Today we simply wish to take note, so that it may be recorded on
the journal of the Court of the profound esteem and the very deep
and warm affection that each of us bears for this very remarkable
American.
"We wish you, Mr. Justice Black, many, many more years of the
kind of health and vigor and wisdom with which the Lord so richly
endowed you.
"In short, Happy Birthday, Sir. And, I may add, I am authorized
by the Court to say this is unanimous; there are no dissents."
