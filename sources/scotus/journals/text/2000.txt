cost methodology adopted by the FCC, which is based on the efficient
replacement cost of existing technology, for determining the intercon-
nection rates that new entrants into local telecommunications markets
must pay incumbent local telephone companies. 2) Whether the court
of appeals erred in holding that neither the Takings Clause nor the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires the incorporation of an incum-
bent local exchange carrier’s "historical” costs into the rates that it may
charge new entrants for access to its network elements. 3) Whether 47
U. S. C. Sec. 251(c)(3) prohibits regulators from requiring that incum-
bent local telephone companies combine certain previously uncombined

ventional cable television programming. 2) Whether those provisions
of the Pole Attachments Act apply to attachments by providers of wire-
less telecommunications services no less than to attachments by pro-
viders of wireline telecommunications services. The cases are consoli-
dated and a total of one hour is allotted for oral argument. Justice
O’Connor took no part in the consideration or decision of this motion
and these petitions.

(JOURNAL)              TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 20, 2001                   549
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

   Present: Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice Stevens, Justice O’Connor,
Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, Justice Souter, Justice Thomas, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer.
   The Chief Justice said:
   “I think it is fitting to note that February 4th, last February 4th
marked the 200th anniversary of John Marshall’s swearing-in as the
fourth Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, as it
then was called.
   “I am quite convinced that Marshall deserves to be recognized along
with George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, and Thomas Jefferson
as one of the ‘founding fathers’ of this country.
   “Marshall served as Chief Justice from 1801 until 1835. He authored
more than 500 opinions, including most of the important cases the
Court decided during his tenure. Using his remarkable ability to rea-
son from general principles to conclusions based on those principles, he
derived from the Constitution a roadmap of how checks and balances
could be enforced in practice. I don’t think I overstate the case to say,
that it is in large part because of Marshall’s tenure on the Supreme
Court that the Third Branch of our government occupies the co-equal
position it does today.
   “One occasionally hears the expression that an institution is the
lengthened shadow of an individual. It may be risky to suggest that an
institution which has endured for over two hundred years the way the
Supreme Court of the United States has, could be the lengthened
shadow one individual; but surely there is only one individual who
could possibly qualify for this distinction, and that is John Marshall.
   “In honor of the 200th Anniversary of John Marshall’s appointment
to the Court, our Curator’s Office has put together an exhibit located
near the statue of John Marshall on the ground floor.
   “Today’s orders of the Court have been certified by The Chief Jus-
tice, filed with the Clerk, and they will not be otherwise announced.”

Application for stay of execution of sentence of death presented to The
Chief Justice and by him referred to the Court granted. Motion for
leave to proceed in forma pauperis granted. Petition for writ of certio-
rari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit
granted limited to the following question: Did the Court of Appeals
err in holding that a defendant must show an actual conflict of interest
and an adverse effect in order to establish a Sixth Amendment viola-
tion where a trial court fails to inquire into a potential conflict of inter-
est about which it reasonably should have known? The stay shall termi-
nate upon the sending down of the judgment of this Court.

submitted for decision this Term. Disposition of items scheduled for
Conference will be reflected on an Order List that will be released at

remaining on the docket, but not ready for consideration are continued
to the session of the Court beginning October 1, 2001.
   “The Court will be in recess from today until the First Monday in
October 2001, at which time the October 2000 Term of the Court will
be adjourned and the October 2001 Term of the Court will begin as
provided by statute.
   “The members of the Court thank all members of the Supreme Court
staff for their outstanding work and their dedication to duty this Term.
Such dedication was evident especially during the Florida election
cases when every member of the Court staff, and I might add, the
leading members of our Bar as well, demonstrated that under severe
time constraints the work of the Court can be smoothly and effi-
ciently accomplished.
   “The Court, the Bar, and the public recognize the hard work, com-
mitment, and professionalism of the Court staff. Marshal Dale Bosley,
who is leaving the Court this summer after seven years, exemplifies
such faithful service. Thank you, Dale, for your outstanding perform-
ance. The superb work by the Court staff contributes significantly to
the accomplishment of the Court’s mission.”
