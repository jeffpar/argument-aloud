MONDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1971
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
1
Present: Mr. Chief Justice Burger, Mr. Justice Douglas, Mr. Jus-
tice Brennan, Mr. Justice Stewart, Mr. Justice White, Mr. Justice
Marshall, and Mr. Justice Blackmun.
The Chief Justice said:
"I have the honor to announce that the 1971 Term of the Supreme
Court of the United States is now convened."
The Chief Justice said:
"It is a sad duty for us to take note today, on opening the October
1971 Term of Court, of the absence from this Bench for the first time
in 34 years, of our beloved colleague the late Justice Hugo Black. His
tenure spanned that of 5 of the 15 Chief Justices who have presided
here since the Constitution was adopted and his departure is a pro-
found loss to each of us personally and to the Court.
"Much has been and much more will be said and written of the life
and work of Mr. Justice Black. His public service in the Army in
World War I, in the State of Alabama, in the United States Senate,
and on this Court covered more than 50 of the 85 years of a life rich
in accomplishment.
"In time, I believe, one thing will stand out above all in his work
and in his thinking. Throughout his entire life he never wavered in
his unbounded faith in the people and in the political processes of a
free people under the American Constitution. He loved this Court
as an institution, and contributed mightily to its work, to its strength,
and to its future. He revered the Constitution; he had enormous
respect for the Presidency and for the Congress, but above all else,
he believed in the people.
"In a period when institutions are under attack and when people
are having doubts about their capacity to govern themselves, this
should give heart to all, for Hugo Black had no doubt whatever about
the ability of an informed and free people to govern their own destinies.
"We will miss his wise counsel, his rare spirit, his vigor, his sparkle,
and the warmth of his comradeship.
"In the near future a date will be fixed for presentation in this Court
of appropriate memorials to him."
480-278-71-1

MONDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1971

The Chief Justice said:
"It is with deep regret that we take note today of the retirement of
our beloved colleague, Mr. Justice Harlan, who served on this Court.
since March 28, 1955, after prior service on the United States Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit.
“Before going on the Bench, Mr. Justice Harlan combined a bril-
liant career as a lawyer with significant positions of high public re-
sponsibility, including a distinguished military career in the European
theater in World War II. Ill health led Mr. Justice Harlan to submit
to retirement when his high sense of duty persuaded him he could not
continue to carry out his obligations to the Court. The volumes of the
U.S. Reports from 1955 through the most recent Term attest to his
prolific and erudite contributions to the work of the Court.
"I speak for the whole Court, and the Bar as well, in expressing
heartfelt wishes for Justice Harlan's restoration to health."
ORDER
On September 24, 1971, during the summer recess, the Chief Justice
entered an order pursuant to Title 28 U.S.C. Sec. 42 temporarily
assigning Mr. Justice Marshall to the Second Circuit as Circuit Justice.

ORDERS IN PENDING CASES
No. A-507. Kenneth J. Hammond et al., petitioners, v. William J.
Brown et al. The application for a stay presented to Mr. Justice
Stewart, and by him referred to the Court, is denied. Mr. Justice
Douglas, believing that the Ohio anti-rioting statutes, Ohio Code
§§ 2923.52 to .54, on their face seem overly broad and prima facie
infringe on freedom of expression protected by the First Amendment,
would grant the stay for the reasons stated in his dissenting opinion in
Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 58.

appellants to amend their pleadings. Opinion per curiam announced
by Mr. Chief Justice Burger. Mr. Justice Powell and Mr. Justice Rehn-
quist took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
The Chief Justice said:
"Since the last regular sitting of the Court in December, our be-
loved brother, Mr. Justice John Marshall Harlan, died, and it is
appro-
priate that we take note today of his death on December 29, 1971.
"Much has already been written in professional journals and in the
nation's press of the life and work of Justice Harlan, and much more
will be said and written. Everyone acknowledges his great contribution
to work of the Court in which he dedicated so large a part of his
career in the law.
"For us in the Court, however, the loss is far more than the loss of
a colleague valued for his great legal abilities, for his penetrating
mind, and as a prodigious worker. He was all of these, but to us he was
much more. The deep personal loss to us in the departure of a beloved
friend whose warmth and gaiety lightened all the burdens and cheered
all the gatherings of the Justices of this Court for sixteen years. Words
are inadequate to express the deep affection felt for John Harlan and
our admiration for his gallant courage in adversity and illness. We
will miss him greatly.
"In due course there will be an appropriate memorial proceeding in
this Court and a date will be fixed for that purpose."

"Mr. Lippitt retired as Marshal of the Court on December 31, but
observers will have noted that on last Friday, January 7, one week after
his retirement, he was present in the courtroom to collaborate with his
successor for the oath-taking ceremonies of our two new colleagues.
This was typical of Perry Lippitt's dedication to duty and loyalty to
the Court that he served so long.

Minneapolis, Minn.
New Orleans, La.
Robert Emery Coyle.
Harold J. Birch.
The Chief Justice said:
"Today we take note with sadness of the death of former Justice
James F. Byrnes in his 93rd year. Justice Byrnes served on this Court
in 1941 and 1942 at which time he resigned from the Court upon being
appointed by President Roosevelt as Director of the Office of Economic
Stabilization. Our sadness on the death of Mr. Justice Byrnes is
tempered by the knowledge of the full and rich and remarkable life
he lived, serving as he did in the House of Representatives, in the
United States Senate, as Governor of the State of South Carolina, as
Secretary of State, and as a Justice of this Court. He therefore served
with great distinction at the highest levels in all three branches of
Government, as well as in the highest office of his native state. His
contributions to stability and peace following World War II have
made his name honored among the statesmen of his time.
"Few men have served their country so long or so well.
"The record will show that adjournment of this Court today will be
in memory of Mr. Justice Byrnes."
The Chief Justice said:
"Mr. Justice Marshall will not be present today but will participate
in the cases to be argued on the basis of the entire record, briefs, and
the tape recording of the oral arguments."

The Chief Justice said:
"The Court is in Special Session this afternoon to receive the Resolu-
tions of the Bar in tribute to Mr. Justice Black. Before we commence
the proceedings, I am requested to remind you that all present are in-
vited by Mrs. Black and the Black family to attend the reception in the
East Conference Room at the close of this proceeding.
Mr. Solicitor General Griswold addressed the Court as follows:
"Mr. Chief Justice, May it Please the Court:
"At the meeting of the members of the Bar of the Supreme Court
just concluded, resolutions expressing profound sorrow at the death
of Justice Hugo Lafayette Black were offered by a committee of which
Mr. Louis Oberdorfer was Chairman.
"Addresses and resolutions were presented by Bernard G. Segal
of the Philadelphia Bar, by Professor Paul A. Freund of Cambridge,
Massachusetts, and by Mr. George Saunders of the Illinois Bar.
"The resolutions unanimously adopted are as follows:
"RESOLUTIONS
"We meet to honor the memory of Justice Hugo LaFayette Black..
"To each Member of your Committee that memory is a vivid one-
for Justice Black was a vivid man. Some of us knew him in his public
life before he came to the Court; some of us knew him across the Bar
in our appearances before this Court; some of us knew him by virtue
of our service as his law clerks; some of us knew him as the attentive,
inspiring Circuit Justice for the Fifth Circuit.
"Vignettes from our memories abound.
"Senator Sparkman, Congressman Pepper and others of us first.
remember Justice Black as Senator Black-feared and fearless in-
vestigator, architect of New Deal legislation, Administration leader
on the Senate Floor, Chairman of the Labor and Education Commit-

TUESDAY, APRIL 18, 1972
514
tee and an influential Member of the Finance, Foreign Affairs, Military
Affairs and Rules Committees.
"Their recollections from the 1930's picture Senator Black's desk
piled high with volumes of American, English and Ancient history
and classics. He was then still heavily engaged in the compensatory
liberal education which he had begun in 1926, while enjoying and
making the most of the relative anonymity of a freshman Senator.
"The advocates among us will most vividly remember Justice Black,
senior Justice for over 25 of his 34 years on the Court, as he appeared
on the bench-"dwarfed" alongside the several relatively substantial
gentlemen who were successively his Chief Justices. When he could be
seen from the Bar, he usually appeared tanned from tennis (even in
the winter), gently rocking, alternately thumbing through briefs, or
with his head slightly cocked, alertly watching counsel-often, it
seemed, awaiting an appropriate moment to pounce a question in his
inimitable Alabama manner.
"One humbler counsellor recalls from an argument concerning the
power of a Judicial Conference to control the work of a Federal Dis-
trict Judge, "the tone of disbelief" with which Justice Black put
a question:
"'Mr. JUSTICE BLACK. You mean that the President of the
United States, in your judgment, has the power under our con-
stitution to determine whether a judge is mentally able to try his
cases? Is that what you are saying?
""Mr. WRIGHT. I am saying exactly that; yes, sir.
"'Mr. JUSTICE BLACK. I think I understand you now.'
"According to the counsellor, Justice Black "leaned far back in his
chair, shaking his head but with a twinkle in his eye.'
"1
"In a last colloquy with counsel Justice Black evoked from the
Solicitor General a concession which the Justice, with obvious relish,
built into his last opinion:
"You [Mr. Justice Black] say that no law means no law, and
that should be obvious. I [the Solicitor General] can only say
Mr. Justice that to me it is equally obvious that 'no law' does not
mean 'no law', and I would seek to persuade the Court that that
is true. ** *12
"Those of us who were law clerks to Justice Black have shared a
special precious privilege. We have, in our small ways, assisted and
closely observed the steely-disciplined working habits of a self-taught
scholar as he resurrected from his own reading and experience and
propagated with his own carefully penned eloquence a fresh, authentic
and now widely-though not universally-accepted appreciation of

the genius of our nation's written Constitution. In the process we have
pitted, or attempted to pit, ourselves in intellectual combat against
what Justice Cardozo once described as one of the most brilliant legal
minds he had ever known.³
"Our privilege included a brief but intimate membership in a family
presided over by a very great man, deeply in love with his wife and
not ashamed to show it. We have observed first hand how even the
greatest of men can be inspired to greater heights of effort and insight
by the unflagging support and admiration of a loved and loving wife.
"The bonds between Justice Black and his law clerks did not end with
the termination of each law clerk's service. They were renewed by
frequent visits, correspondence and formal gatherings for important
anniversaries and birthdays. On his 80th birthday, Justice Black spoke
to his clerks and their wives about the disadvantages and advantages
of growing old. The disadvantages were obvious enough and he related
some. There were also surprising advantages: 'As one grows old, one
needs less sleep.' That, said Justice Black, 'gives that much more time
to work.'

"One of Justice Black's law clerks recently wrote an extremely
popular, but controversial, book. It was Justice Black's habit to focus
on his reading by heavy underscoring and frequent longhand penciled
margin notes. Justice Black's copy of this law clerk's book carries in
its margin some trenchant annotations.
"The author wrote of the glory of the original American dream of
a free democratic society, observing sadly that:
""Less than two hundred years later almost every aspect of the
dream has been lost. In this chapter we shall be concerned with
the forces that destroyed the American dream.5
In the margin Justice Black wrote in heavy pencil :
"I do not agree. It is not yet destroyed."
The law clerk-author, striving to identify a new set of values for
our society, bluntly disparaged the old. He wrote:
"[Our earliest generation known as] Consciousness I believe
that the American dream is still possible, and that success is deter-
mined by character, morality, hard work, and self-denial. ***6
"In the margin Justice Black's longhand note proclaimed:
"'I still do.'
"The judges of the Fifth Circuit have been favored for many
years by the inspiring presence of Justice Black at their annual Judi-
cial Conferences. The last 18 years have been trying ones for Fifth

Circuit Judges. Justice Black shared those trials while he provided
leadership and reassurance that "this, too, will pass." The Fifth Cir-
cuit Judges perhaps appreciate, more than others, the full implica-
tions of Justice Black's role in this Court's steadfast effort to eliminate
unconstitutional discrimination in our land. He was the only Justice
from the Deep South when the Court decided Brown. As on other
occasions when he was personally attacked, he silently suffered with
manly dignity the unpleasant reprisals inflicted upon him and his
loved ones in the South. Nor did he flinch in his determination to see
it through. As a single Circuit Justice he finalized the order for the
admission of James Meredith to the University of Mississippi, the
enforcement of which required a substantial military operation. As
Circuit Justice, and with the full Court, he eliminated the 'all deliberate
speed' concept as a brake on school desegregation."
"In an informal farewell address to one of the last Judicial Con.
ferences of his Circuit which he attended Justice Black spoke of his
pride in the way the Southern federal judges had performed their
difficult and often unpopular duty of applying the Constitution and en-
forcing the civil rights laws, particularly with respect to the Brown
decision. He reminded them of the constancy of controversy and his
belief that he and they were strengthened by it. In conclusion he told
them good-by. He said:
"I have been coming to see you for thirty years, how many more
I cannot know. I, too, like many of the judges I have seen here,
have passed over the crest, over the brow of the hill. I hope I have
learned more tolerance, more friendship, more about the love of
human kindness during those thirty years.
""Now I am far beyond the crest. I look over into the glowing
rays that come with sunset. The years have been happy for me;
the people have been good to me. I have no complaint about my
life, and as I look at those rays they do not frighten me. I know
that life is change, and the greatest change of all is who is to be
here at any certain period. All that I can say and hope for is that
my career has been such that people of integrity of thought,
when they think about me, will picture a person who tried his
dead level best to serve his people and his country with every
ounce of energy, love and devotion that he could muster in his
life, and that, when those rays cease to be in my vision, each of you
and every member of this Conference will remember me as one
who did his best.'
"For most of his years on the Bench Justice Black adhered to a
strictly ascetic view of a judge's role and made no serious public state-
ments. In his later years he relented to the extent of delivering the
First James Madison Lecture on the First Amendment, explaining his
philosophy of the Constitution in an hour-long television special en-

titled 'Mr. Justice Black and the Bill of Rights,' and delivering the
Carpentier Lectures at Columbia University. In the latter he under-
took to state 'in simple and clear language' his 'constitutional faith.'
He opened the Lectures with the observation that:
"[I]t is of paramount importance that our country has a writ-
ten Constitution the purpose of which was to 'establish govern-
ments controlled by the people themselves.' Carpentier Lectures,
p. 5.
"Justice Black continued with simple eloquence to express his faith
in the Constitution as an ingenious instrument to be invoked by the
Supreme Court to assure control of government by the people subject
to restraints specifically embodied in the Constitution primarily to
limit government power and to protect minorities from majorities.
"Justice Black's deep faith in the Constitution expressed near the
end of his long service on this Court was built upon rich experience as
an active, successful trial lawyer, a fair and efficient municipal court
judge, a vigorous prosecutor, candidate for public office, and as United
States Senator.8 His time on the Court began as the country struggled
to design solutions for the social and economic problems generated and
widened by the great depression. It continued through World War II,
the Cold War confrontations with their corollary domestic shock
waves, the conflicts which followed in the wake of the Brown deci-
sion and finally, in the 1960's, the violence of assassinations, street
crime, increased racial tension and an unpopular war.
"In his later years, he sparred with commentators and colleagues
who claimed that his fundamental views had changed with these
changing times. He disagreed:
"I think that I can say categorically that I have not changed
my basic constitutional philosophy-at least not in the last 40
years.'⁹
"He convinced at least one commentator who recently concluded:
""The remarkable thing about him was not his ability to change
with the times but the timelessness of the values of justice, free-
dom and human dignity, to which he held, and for which he
fought.' 10
"Justice Black came to the Court committed, as a Senator, to the
view that popular control of the government was frustrated by what
he deemed to be excessive judicial restraints drawn from the Due Proc-
ess clause and the Commerce Clause of the Constitution.11 From the
beginning to the end of his service he fought what he considered to be
unauthorized efforts of judges to supersede the judgment of voters and

their elected representatives with the judges' views of appropriate
remedies for social and economic problems.12
"Justice Black also came to the Court convinced that it had an affirm-
ative responsibility to make other branches of the national govern-
ment as fully responsive to the will of the people as was consistent with
orderly process and protection of minorities. His experience and read-
ing reinforced his faith in the practical wisdom of the separation of
powers effected by the Constitution between the Executive, Legislative
and Judicial branches of government and between the national gov-
ernment and the states. He repeatedly urged the Court to review and
strike down attempts by the Executive to legislate, adjudicate or en-
gage in activity proscribed, or not plainly authorized; 13 by the Legis-
lature to adjudicate or enforce through Congressional Committees or
by personal legislation resembling bills of attainder; 14 and by the
Judiciary to legislate or administer. 15 Any significant weakening of the
careful separation contemplated by the Constitution could, he believed,
lead to an inordinate accretion of power in one or another of the
branches which would tempt the overreaching branch to destroy or
undermine the others and then turn, unfettered, upon the people, frus-
trating their will and tyrannically abusing their liberties.
"As Justice Black was helping to confine the power of judges
to restrain the people's elected representatives from addressing them-
selves to solutions of pressing social and economic needs, he also sought
to direct the Court's prestige and power toward what he conceived as
primary roles which were fashioned for it by the plain words of the
Constitution. Drawing on his experience as a prosecutor, a judge and a
12 See, e.g., Hugo L. Black, "Reorganization of the Federal Judiciary," a radio address
reported in New York Times, arch 30, 1937.
13 "In the framework of our Constitution, the President's power to see that the laws are
faithfully executed refutes the idea that he is to be a lawmaker. The Constitution limits
his functions in the law-making process to the recommending of laws he thinks wise and the
vetoing of laws he thinks bad. And the Constitution is neither silent nor equivocal about
who shall make laws which the President is to execute. The first section of the first article
says that 'All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United
States. ***"
"The Founders of this Nation entrusted the law-making power to the Congress alone in
good and bad times. It would do no good to recall the historical events, the fears of power
and the hopes of freedom that lay behind their choice. Such a review would but confirm
our holding that this seizure order cannot stand." Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer,
343 U.S. 579, 587-89 (1952). See also, Gregory v. Chicago, 394 U.S. 113, 120 (1968)
(Black J., concurring).
14 "Those who wrote our Constitution well knew the danger inherent in special legisla-
tive acts which take away the life, liberty, or property of particular named persons because
the legislature thinks them guilty of conduct which deserves punishment. They intended to
safeguard the people of this country from punishment without trial by duly constituted
courts. * * * When our Constitution and Bill of Rights were written, our ancestors had
ample reason to know that legislative trials and punishments were too dangerous to
liberty to exist in the nation of free men they envisioned. And so they proscribed bills of
attainder." United States v. Lovett, 328 U.S. 303, 317-18 (1946).
15 Justice Black's insistence that the judiciary stay within the province of deciding
specific cases presented to it by litigants is probably best demonstrated by his repeated
dissents from the Court's promulgation of rules, such as the Federal Rules of Civil Pro-
cedure. See, e.g., Statement of Mr. Justice Black and Mr. Justice Douglas, 374 U.S. 865-66
(1963):
"We believe that while some of the Rules of Civil Procedure are simply housekeeping
details, many determine matters so substantially affecting the rights of litigants in law-
suits that in practical effect they are the equivalent of new legislation which, in our
judgment, the Constitution requires to be initiated in and enacted by the Congress and
approved by the President. The Constitution, as we read it, provides that all laws shall
be enacted by the House, the Senate and the President, not by the mere failure of Congress
to reject proposals of an outside agency."

Senator, he used simple but eloquent language to focus and renew the
attention of his Brethren and the public upon three particular elements
of orderly government by the people under our Constitution: full
adherence to the procedural protections to the Bill of Rights and
other provisions of the Constitution designed to protect the individual
from abuse of government power; free and universal access to the
political process; and absolute freedom of speech, belief and thought.
I
"In his grand jury investigation of police brutality and other first
hand experience while serving as Solicitor of Jefferson County, Ala-
bama, Hugo Black had witnessed the helplessness of the poor and the
unfortunate when confronted by the power of government and the
corrupting effect of official lawlessness. A 1915 Grand Jury investigat-
ing police brutality in Bessemer, Alabama, had filed a report (very
likely written for it by the special prosecutor who conducted the
investigation, Hugo Black) which concluded:
"A man does not forfeit his right to be treated as a human
being by reason of the fact that he is charged with, or an officer
suspects that he is guilty of a crime. Instead of being ready and
waiting to strike a prisoner in his custody, an officer should protect
him. Such practices are dishonorable, tyrannical, and despot-
ic, and such rights must not be surrendered to any officer or set of
officers, so long as human life is held sacred, and human liberty
and human safety of paramount importanc.16
In his third term on the Supreme Court Justice Black was confronted
by a case in which his Alabama experience and his Constitutional
philosophy merged to produce an early, and possibly immortal, expres-
sion of the role of the courts in providing fair trials for the helpless
citizen threatened by government. In Chambers v. Florida, 309 U.S.
227, 240–41 (1940), four young Negro tenant farmers petitioned the
Court to reverse their murder convictions based on confessions obtained
after seven days of uninterrupted grilling. Justice Black's majority
opinion in that case struck a note which he resounded again and again
over the years:
"We are not impressed by the argument that law enforce-
ment methods such as those under review are necessary to uphold
our laws. The Constitution proscribes such lawless means irrespec-
tive of the end. And this argument flouts the basic principle that
all people must stand on an equality before the bar of justice
in every American court. Today, as in ages past, we are not with-
out tragic proof that the exalted power of some governments to
punish manufactured crime dictatorially is the handmaid of
tyranny. Under our Constitutional system, courts stand against
any winds that blow as havens or refuge for those who might

520
otherwise suffer because they are helpless, weak, outnumbered,
or because they are non-conforming victims of prejudice and pub-
lic excitement. Due process of law, preserved for all by our Con-
stitution, commands that no such practice as that disclosed by this
record shall send any accused to his death. No higher duty, no
more solemn responsibility, rests upon this Court, than that of
translating into living law and maintaining this constitutional
shield deliberately planned and inscribed for the benefit of every
human being subject to our Constitution of whatever race, creed,
or persuasion."
"Justice Black also knew from his own experience as prosecutor and
defense counsel that a defendant could seldom, if ever, receive a just
trial without representation by an attorney. How could a defendant,
even one released on bail, marshall the facts? How could he compre-
hend the legal questions? How could be avoid the procedural pitfalls
and traps built into the criminal justice system? How could he ap-
proach the bench and address the learned judge? How could he choose
the jury?
"In a 1942 case, involving a poor unemployed farm hand who was
tried without the aid of counsel and convicted, Justice Black stated
his strongly held view, which he believed he shared with the men who
wrote the Sixth Amendment, that a lawyer is indispensable to a de-
fendant on trial for his liberty. Betts v. Brady. 316 U.S. 455, 476–77
(1942). While Justice Black's dissent argued that the Fourteenth
Amendment made the Sixth Amendment applicable to the States, he
also maintained that:
"A practice cannot be reconciled with "common and funda-
mental ideas of fairness and right," which subjects innocent men
to increased dangers of conviction merely because of their poverty.
Whether a man is innocent cannot be determined from a trial in
which, as here, denial of counsel has made it impossible to con-
clude, with any satisfactory degree of certainty, that the defend-
ant's case was adequately presented.***
'[N]o man **** [should] be deprived of counsel merely be-
cause of his poverty. Any other practice seems to be to defeat
the promise of our democratic society to provide equal justice
under the law.'
"As Justice Black wrote his Chambers. Betts and related opinions
and studied the history of the Constitution and its Amendments, he
began, in the 1940's, to question the validity of the process by which his
predecessors and colleagues selected concepts or provisions from the
Bill of Rights to apply to the States while rejecting others. His study
convinced him that the draftsmen of the Bill of Rights had designed
a nearly perfect device for use by Courts in protecting individual
liberty and the democratic process from the natural tyranny of Gov-
ernment by men with power, and that the genius of the Bill of Rights
480-278-72-

TUESDAY, APRIL 18, 1972
521
had been fully appreciated by the Framers of the Fourteenth Amend-
ment when they were selecting a mechanism to protect the citizens
of the States, particularly Negro citizens, from the tyranny of state
government power. The Fourteenth Amendment Framers had quite
understandably and naturally turned to the honored and tested Bill
of Rights as the means of extending specific Federal constitutional pro-
tections to all levels of government, instead of trying to fashion some
vague new formula, such as rights "implicit in the concept of ordered
liberty", as the means of carrying out their purpose. His diligent study
and persistent search for basic principles bore fruit in Adamson v.
California, 332 U.S. 46, 89 (1947), where his dissent laid the corner-
stone for much of the rest of his life's work. He wrote there:
"I cannot consider the Bill of Rights to be an outworn Eight-
eenth Century "straitjacket" as the Twining opinion did. Its pro-
visions may be thought outdated abstractions by some. And it is
true that they were designed to meet ancient evils. But they are
the same kind of human evils that have emerged from century to
century wherever excessive power is sought by the few at the ex-
pense of the many. In my judgment the people of no nation can
lose their liberty so long as a Bill of Rights like ours survives and
its basic purposes are conscientiously interpreted, enforced, and
respected so as to afford continuous protection against old, as well
as new, devices and practices which might thwart those purposes.
I fear to see the consequences of the Court's practice of substitut-
ing its own concepts of decency and fundamental justice for the
language of the Bill of Rights as its point of departure in inter-
preting and enforcing that Bill of Rights If the choice must be
between the selective process of the Palko decision applying some
of the Bill of Rights to the States, or the Twining rule applying
none of them, I would choose the Palko selective process. But
rather than accept either of these choices, I would follow what I
believe was the original purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment—
to extend to all the people of the Nation the complete protection
of the Bill of Rights. To hold that this Court can determine what,
if any, provisions of the Bill of Rights will be enforced, and if so
to what degree, is to frustrate the great design of a written
Constitution."
"Upon this foundation he rested his many forceful opinions insist-
ing not only that the Bill of Rights restrained the power of state gov-
ernments but also that each Amendment applied with exactly the same
meaning, force and effect to the States as it applied to the Federal
Government.
"Although in Justice Black's lifetime the full Court did not adopt
his view that the Fourteenth Amendment had incorporated the Bill
of Rights, and it has been the subject of considerable controversy.17
there is little doubt about the impact of the Adamson dissent. By the
17 Fairman, Does the Fourteenth Amendment Incorporate the Bill of Rights? 2 Stanford
L. Rev. 5 (1949).

TUESDAY, APRIL 18, 1972
522
time Justice Black left the bench almost all the elements of the Bill
of Rights had been applied to the States.
"A charming by-product of Justice Black's effort to make the Bill
of Rights applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment
was one of the most intense intellectual contests and one of the closest
friendships of Justice Black's life, both with Justice John Marshall
Harlan. Justice Black often said that his fear of the power of judges,
undoubtedly strengthened by the Court's substantive due process
opinions in the 1920's and 1930's, would have little foundation if
judges were all like Justice Harlan. It is a happy vignette of judicial
history and a tribute to both men that their friendship grew and
flourished in the midst of their vigorous debate. The story of that
friendship had its final chapter in adjacent rooms at Bethesda Naval
Hospital; the friendly struggle will probably be carried on by the
disciples of each Justice.
"The 'incorporation' theory of the Fourteenth Amendment and
Justice Black's fight for counsel in all criminal cases came together
in the Court's 1963 decision that the Sixth Amendment, made appli-
cable to the States by the Fourteenth, requires that every defendant
charged with a crime must be offered counsel by the State if he is
without means to hire his own. Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335,
344 (1963). In vindication of his dissent in Betts v. Brady, Justice
Black recorded the Court's recognition that:
"[I]n our adversary system of criminal justice, any person
haled into court, who is too poor to hire a lawyer, cannot be
assured a fair trial unless counsel is provided for him. This
seems to us to be an obvious truth. ***That government hires
lawyers to prosecute and defendants who have the money hire
lawyers to defend are the strongest indications of the widespread
belief that lawyers in criminal courts are necessities, not luxuries.
The right of one charged with crime to counsel may not be
deemed fundamental and essential to fair trials in some coun-
tries, but it is in ours. From the very beginning, our state and
national constitutions and laws have laid great emphasis on pro-
cedural and substantive safeguards designed to assure fair trails
before impartial tribunals in which every defendant stands equal
before the law. This noble ideal cannot be realized if the poor man
charged with crime has to face his accusers without a lawyer to
assist him. ***,
"Justice Black's belief in the vital role of counsel in criminal cases
was reflected in his efforts to limit the contempt power of judges, par-
ticularly as related to lawyers' vigorous in-court efforts to defend their
clients. He viewed the authority vested in a single life-tenured jurist to
punish a lawyer for contempt after a trial on account of the lawyer's
conduct of that trial as an anathema to the very concept of the Bill of
Rights. In Sacher v. United States, 343 U.S. 1, 19, 22 (1952), for ex-
ample, Justice Black dissented from the affirmance of a summary

criminal contempt sentence imposed by a United States District Judge
upon attorneys who had energetically defended their Communist
clients. He wrote:
"Unless we are to depart from high traditions of the bar, evil
purposes of their clients could not be imputed to these lawyers
whose duty it was to represent them with fidelity and zeal.
Yet from the very parts of the record which *** [the trial judge]
specified, it is difficult to escape the impression that his inferences
against the lawyers were colored, however unconsciously, by his
natural abhorrence for the unpatriotic and treasonable designs
attributed to their Communist leader clients. It appears to me
that if there have ever been, or can ever be, cases in which lawyers
are entitled to a full hearing before their liberty is forfeited and
their professional hopes are blighted, these are such cases.

"Are defendants accused by judges of being offensive to them
to be conclusively presumed guilty on the theory that judges'
observations and inferences must be accepted as infallible? There
is always a possibility that a judge may be honestly mistaken. Un-
fortunately history and the existence of our Bill of Rights indi-
cate that judicial errors may be from worse causes.'
"The Bar's fond memories and high admiration for Justice Black
may reflect his manifest faith in adversary proceedings in court as the
best means to do justice. His opinion for the Court in Gideon v. Wain-
wright displayed his commitment to the vital role of lawyers in the
adversary process. In Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Virginia
ex rel. Virginia State Bar, 377 U.S. 1,7 (1964), Justice Black's opinion
for the Court upholding the right of unionized workers on the railroad
to associate and seek legal advice in implementing their rights under
federal laws enacted for their benefit said:
"A State could not, by invoking the power to regulate the
professional conduct of attorneys, infringe in any way the right of
individuals and the public to be fairly represented in lawsuits
authorized by Congress to effectuate a basic public interest.
'Laymen cannot be expected to know how to protect their rights
when dealing with practiced and carefully counseled adversaries.
. . . and for them to associate together to help one another to
preserve and enforce rights granted them under federal laws.
cannot be condemned as a threat to legal ethics. The State can no
more keep these workers from using their cooperative plan to ad-
vise one another than it could use more direct means to bar them
from resorting to the courts to vindicate their legal rights. The
right to petition the courts cannot be so handicapped.'
"Securing access to counsel for the injured and the aggrieved was
for Justice Black the easier part of the issue. He worked harder and
longer against efforts of government officials, judges and bar associa-
tion committees to stifle change and peaceful dissent from the status
quo by disciplining and thereby intimidating or excluding lawyers who

TUESDAY, APRIL 18, 1972
524
failed to conform to current notions of 'loyalty' or who refused to
submit to a searching examination of their personal beliefs and ties.
His years on the Bench through World War II, the Joseph McCarthy
Era and the desegregation struggle confronted Justice Black and the
Court with repeated instances in which Courts and the Organized Bar
sanctioned or attempted to sanction courageous lawyers who stood up
for their clients' beliefs and constitutional privileges and who vigor-
ously defended unpopular causes. Over Justice Black's classic dissents,
a divided Court in 1961 affirmed decisions banning Raphael Konigs-
berg and George Anastaplo from the legal profession.
"In Konigsberg v. State Bar of California, 366 U.S. 36 (1961) and
In Re Anastaplo, 366 U.S. 82, 114 (1961), Justice Black eloquently
documented his unshakable belief in the honorable role of courageous
unorthodox lawyers. In Anastaplo he said:
""This case illustrates to me the serious consequences to the
Bar itself of not affording the full protections of the First Amend-
ment to its applicants for admission. For this record shows that
Anastaplo has many of the qualities that are needed in the Ameri-
can Bar. It shows, not only that Anastaplo has followed a high
moral, ethical, and patriotic course in all of the activities of his
life, but also that he combines these more common virtues with the
uncommon virtue of courage to stand by his principles at any cost.
It is such men as these who have most greatly honored the profes-
sion of the law-men like Malsherbes, who, at the cost of his own
life and the lives of his family, sprang unafraid to the defense
of Louis XVI against the fanatical leaders of the Revolutionary
government of France-men like Charles Evans Hughes, Sr., later
Mr. Chief Justice Hughes, who stood up for the constitution
rights of socialists to be socialists and public officials despite the
threats and clamorous protests of self-proclaimed super patriots-
men like Charles Evans Hughes, Jr., and John W. Davis, who,
while against everything for which the Communists stood,
strongly advised the Congress in 1948 that it would be uncon-
stitutional to pass the law then proposed to outlaw the Communist
Party men like Lord Erskine, James Otis, Clarence Darrow, and
the multitudes of others who have dared to speak in defense of
causes and clients without regard to personal danger to them-
selves. The legal profession will lose much of its nobility and its
glory if it is not constantly replenished with lawyers like these.
To force the Bar to become a group of thoroughly orthodox, time-
serving, government-fearing individuals is to humiliate and de-
grade it."
His stirring dissent in Anastaplo, quoted above, led to a long exchange
of letters with the unsuccessful petitioner and, more importantly, to
an ultimate change of the Court's position. Baird v. State Bar of Ari-
zona, 401 U.S. 1 (1971) ; In re Stolar, 401 U.S. 23 (1971).
For Justice Black the constitutional guarantees of a jury trial in
all criminal and most civil cases embodied in the Sixth and Seventh
Amendments provided essential flexibility in the administration of
480-278-72-106

TUESDAY, APRIL 18, 1972
525
justice and an ultimate restraint on possible abuse of power by judges.
The jury, consisting of men drawn from the community to hear a
particular dispute, was an institution with which Hugo Black had
shared great experiences. Perhaps these experiences and his diligent
study of English History led him to agree with Alexander Hamilton
that the citizens who ratified the Constitution could be divided "be-
tween those who thought that jury trial was a 'valuable safeguard to
liberty' and those who thought it was the 'very palladium of free
government." "Galloway v. United States, 319 U.S. 372, 397-98 (1943).
His efforts to emphasize and strengthen the jury's role as a counter-
balance to the power of judges are typified by his opinions that a jury
trial should be afforded in contempt proceedings in which the judge
might otherwise be the unrestrained accuser, prosecutor and arbitrator
of the sentence. See, e.g., United States v. United Mine Workers, 330
U.S. 258, 328 (1947). His view was perhaps best expressed in United
States v. Barnett, 376 U.S. 681 (1964). He wrote:
"No provisions of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights were
more widely approved throughout the new nation than those
guaranteeing a right to trial by jury in all criminal prosecutions.
***They were adopted in part, I think, because many people
knew about and disapproved of the type of colonial happen-
ings *** in which *** people had been sentenced to be fined,
thrown in jail, humiliated in stocks, whipped, and even nailed
by the ear to a pillory, all punishments imposed by judges with-
out jury trials. Unfortunately, as the Court's opinion points out,
judges in the past despite these constitutional safeguards have
claimed for themselves "inherent" power, acting without a jury
and without other Bill of Rights safeguards, to punish for
criminal contempt of court people whose conduct they find of-
fensive. I do not agree that any such "inherent" power exists.
Certainly no language in the Constitution permits it; in fact, it
is expressly forbidden by the two constitutional commands for
trial by jury.
"Justice Black was not deflected from his insistence upon the strict
application of the Bill of Rights to individual cases, including the right
to trial by jury, by the prospect that some defendants who had, in
fact, committed crimes would, on occasion, escape the consequences of
these crimes. In a rare public interview on a national television special,
he stated:
"Why did they write the Bill of Rights? [The first ten
Amendments] practically all relate to the way cases shall be tried,
and practically all of them make it more difficult to convict people
of crime. What about guaranteeing a man a right to a lawyer?
Of course, that makes it more difficult to convict him. What about
saying that he shall not be compelled to be a witness against him-
self? That makes it more difficult to convict him. *** They were
every one intended to make it more difficult before the doors of a
prison closed on a man. ***CBS News Special: Mr. Justice Black

lection, FBA 6334, Reel 2, 600-650 feet.
However, his concern for law enforcement never faded. In cases where
he felt that a majority of the Court expanded the scope of the Fourth
Amendment proscription against 'unreasonable' searches and seizures,
he chided them:
"It is difficult for me to believe the Founders intended that the
police be required to prove a defendant's guilt in a “little trial"
before the issuance of a search warrant. ***Eavesdroppers were
deemed to be competent witnesses in both English and American
courts up until this Court in its Fourth Amendment "rulemaking"
capacity undertook to lay down rules for electronic surveillance.
***The reasonableness of a search incident to an arrest, extend-
ing to areas under the control of the defendant and areas where
evidence may be found, was an established tenet of English com-
mon law, and American constitutional law after adoption of the
Fourth Amendment—that is, until Chimel v. California, 395 U.S.
752 (1969). The broad, abstract, and ambiguous concept of "pri-
vacy" is now unjustifiably urged as a comprehensive substitute for
the Fourth Amendment's guarantee against "unreasonable searches
and seizures." Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965).
""Our Government is founded upon a written Constitution. The
draftsmen expressed themselves in careful and measured terms
corresponding with the immense importance of the powers dele-
gated to them. The Framers of the Constitution, and the people
who adopted it, must be understood to have used words in their
natural meaning, and to have intended what they said. The Con-
stitution itself contains the standards by which the seizure of evi-
dence challenged in the present case and the admissibility of that
evidence at trial is to be measured in the absence of congressional
legislation.' Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 499–500
(1971).
"In Justice Black's view an orderly courtroom was also a necessary
ingredient for the conduct of a fair trial. This view was forcefully
expressed in his opinion outlining the sanctions available to a judge
faced with an obstreperous defendant in the courtroom. His opinion
for the Court in Illinois v. Allen, 397 U.S. 337, 346–47 (1970), states:
"It is not pleasant to hold that the respondent Allen was
properly banished from the court for a part of his own trial. But
our courts, palladiums of liberty as they are. cannot be treated
disrespectfully with impunity. Nor can the accused be permitted
by his disruptive conduct indefintely to avoid being tried on the
charges brought against him. It would degrade our country and
our judicial system to permit our courts to be bullied, insulted,
and humiliated and their orderly progress thwarted and
obstructed by defendants brought before them charged with
crimes. As guardians of the public welfare, our state and federal
judicial systems strive to administer equal justice to the rich and
the poor, the good and the bad, the native and foreign born of
every race, nationality, and religion. Being manned by humans,
the courts are not perfect and are bound to make some errors.

TUESDAY, APRIL 18, 1972
527
But, if our courts are to remain what the Founders intended, the
citadels of justice, their proceedings cannot and must not be
infected with the short of scurrilous, abusive language and con-
duct paraded before the Illinois trial judge in this case. ***

"Justice Black's work reflects his concept that a second major role
of the Court under the Constitution was to open the channels of the
political process. During his service on the Court controversies about
popular control of government appeared in several diverse forms.
When Justice Black cam to the bench, electoral equality generally was
far from a reality. The Court regarded reapportionment as a "political
thicket" to be avoided. 18 Justice Black, however, saw the threat to our
Constitutional form of government in self-perpetuating "rotten
boroughs" as a responsibility of the Court as interpreter and enforcer
of the Constitution. For him the right to an undiluted vote was "too
important in our free society to be stripped of judicial protection.” 19
In his dissenting opinion in Colegrove v. Green, 328 U.S. 549 (1946),
he forcast not only penetration of the reapportionment thicket but also
the ultimate "one-man, one-vote" standard adopted by the Court in
Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533 (1964).
"In the South, the controversies about access to the political process
focused on racial discrimination. At a time when the South was con-
sidered by many an eccentric pocket of racial discrimination, in con-
trast with the rest of the nation, Justice Black spoke of the people of the
South as decent and compassionate human beings, who, he believed,
could, with leadership, live down the tragedies of slavery, the Civil
War, Reconstruction and segregation. His opinions stressed that equal
education and equal suffrage were the principal means to total equality
under law. Perhaps his Senate campaign days, stumping the State
of Alabama, led him to believe that no right could create the respect for
a man or recognition of his views by elected officials like his right to
vote for local, county, state and federal officers.20 But he dissented from
the Court's decisions upholding regional sanctions against voting
discrimination which he viewed as penalties against the Southern states
reminiscent of Reconstruction.21
"By the time Justice Black died, the face of the South had changed
dramatically. School desegregation spurred by Alexander v. Holmes
County Bd. of Ed.. 396 U.S. 1218 (1969), had produced more school
integration in the South than in the North. Negro officials sat in State
Legislatures for the first time since Reconstruction and various cities

19 Wesberry V. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1 (1964).
20 Voter registration, facilitated by court decisions and new federal legislation, had
established the Southern Negroes as a potential political force, particularly in local
affairs.

and towns had black mayors or aldermen. A new spirit of warmth and
moderation pervaded Southern politics replacing the bluster of mas-
sive resistance.
"When specific groups were disenfranchised or forced to forfeit
full political participation, Justice Black defended them. For example,
he dissented from the Court's opinion sustaining the constitutionality
of the Hatch Act, which barred public employees from engaging in
political activity.
""The section of the Act here held valid reduces the constitu-
tionally protected liberty of several million citizens to less than a
shadow of its substance. It relegates millions of federal, state, and
municipal employees to the role of mere spectators of events upon
which hinge the safety and welfare of all the people, including
public employees. It removes a sizable proportion of our electorate
from full participation in affairs destined to mold the fortunes
of the Nation. It makes honest participation in essential political
activities an offense punishable by proscription from public em-
ployment. It endows a governmental board with the awesome
power to censor the thoughts, expressions, and activities of law-
abiding citizens in the field of free expression from which no per-
son should be barred by a government which boasts that it is a
government of, for, and by the people-all the people. Laudable
as its purpose may be, it seems to me to hack at the roots of a gov-
ernment by the people themselves; and consequently I cannot agree
to sustain its validity.' United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330
U.S. 75, 115 (1947). (Emphasis added.)
"In Williams v. Rhodes. 393 U.S. 23, 30-31 (1968), Justice Black
led the Court to take another step toward equal access for all to the
ballot box by coming to the aid of a political candidate, whose views
and actions Justice Black may well have abhorred. The American In-
dependent Party candidate for President had been denied a place
on the ballot because he had failed to secure sufficient petition signa-
tures by the appropriate date. In striking down the complex rules
which infringed on George Wallace's right to become a candidate,
Justice Black wrote:
"In the present situation the state laws place burdens on two
different, although overlapping, kinds of rights-the right of
individuals to associate for the advancement of political beliefs,
and the right of qualified voters, regardless of their political per-
suasion, to cast their votes effectively. Both of these rights, of
course, rank among our most precious freedoms. We have re-
peatedly held that freedom of association is protected by the First
Amendment. And of course this freedom protected against fed-
eral encoachment by the First Amendment is entitled to the same
protection from infringement by the States. Similarly we have
said with reference to the right to vote: 'No right is more previous
in a free country than that of having a voice in the election of
480-278-72- -107

529
those who make the laws under which, as good citizens, we must
live. Other rights, even the most basic, are illusory if the right to
vote is undermined.""
III
"The third area in which Justice Black sought to fulfill the goals of
the Founding Fathers, as he perceived them, and the area in which
his constitutional faith attracted the greatest public attention involved
what Oliver Wendell Holmes called the "free trade of ideas.” In a real
sense, Justice Black viewed the First Amendment as the foundation
of the American democratic process the foundation that permitted
a man to conceive an idea, to express it, and to associate with other
men of like persuasion to further their common interests. It would be
difficult to find better words to express this belief in the First Amend-
ment than those chosen by Justice Black himself early in his Court
career. In Febraury 1941, less than four years after he was appointed to
the Court, he wrote:
"'I view the guarantees of the First Amendment as the foun-
dation upon which our governmental structure rests and without
which it could not continue to endure as conceived and planned.
Freedom to speak and write about public questions is as impor-
tant to the life of our government as is the heart to the human
body. In fact, this privilege is the heart of our government. If
that heart be weakened, the result is debilitation; if it be stilled.
the result is death.' Milk Wagon Drivers Union v. Meadowmoor
Dairies, 312 U.S. 287 (1941). (Emphasis added.)
“Like the human heart, the liberty which is the core of a democratic
government requires the greatest protection in times of severe stress,
such as war or social upheaval. In each such time of crisis, Justice
Black stood beside the First Amendment against a tide of popular
opinion so aroused in opposition to a common 'enemy' that it often
failed to recognize the self-destructive consequences of its own actions.
Justice Black saw the threat which he communicated with eloquent
simplicity in his dissents:
""I do not believe that it can be too often repeated that the free-
doms of speech, press, petition and assembly guaranteed by the
First Amendment must be accorded to the ideas we hate or sooner
or later they will be denied to the ideas we cherish. ***Com-
munist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board, 367 U.S. 1,
137 (1961).
"After World War II, sentiment was strong against persons of
German descent. When the Court upheld the deportation of a German
alien who was alleged to be "dangerous to the public peace and safety"
under the Alien Enemy Act, Justice Black dissented, drawing an
analogy to the 1798 Alien and Sedition Acts. He wrote:

TUESDAY, APRIL 18, 1972
530
"But the First Amendment represents this nation's belief that
the spread of political ideas must not be suppressed. And the
avowed purpose of the Alien Enemy Act was not to stifle the
spread of ideas after hostilities had ended. Others in the series
of Alien and Sedition Acts did provide for prison punishment of
people who had or at least who dared to express political ideas.
I cannot now agree to an interpretation of the Alien Enemy Act
which gives a new life to the long repudiated anti-free speech and
anti-free press philosophy of the 1798 Alien and Sedition Acts. I
would not disinter that philosophy which the people have long
hoped Thomas Jefferson had permanently buried when he par-
doned the last person convicted for violation of the Alien and
Sedition Acts." Ludecke v. Watkins, 335 U.S. 160,181-82 (1948).
"The Korean conflict brought on another cycle of public harrass-
ment of allegedly or potentially disloyal citizens, communists and
their sympathizers. Justice Black's resistance to the extraordinary
measures taken by a fearful government and its frightened citizens.
brought him much personal abuse. The personal attacks only strength-
ened his faith and heightened the insight and courage that he em-
bodied in his written memorials to free speech. His dissent on behalf
of eleven American Communist Party leaders at the height of the
Korean War in Dennis v. United States, 341 U.S. 494, 580-81 (1951),
is one such memorial.
""The opinions for affirmance indicate that the chief reason for
jettisoning the rule is the expressed fear that advocacy of Com-
munist doctrine endangers the safety of the Republic. Undoubted-
ly, a governmental policy of unfetted communication of ideas does
entail dangers. To the Founders of this Nation, however, the
benefits derived from free expression were worth the risk.
"'Public opinion being what is now is, few will protest the con-
viction of these Communist petitioners. There is hope, however,
that in calmer times, when present pressures, passions and fears
subside, this or some later Court will restore the First Amendment
liberties to the high preferred place where they belong in a free
society.'
"Even before Cold War tensions had relaxed, the Nation and the
Court were confronted by the inevitable tensions generated by the
American Negro's increasingly successful struggle for equality. The
marches, demonstrations, sit-ins and confrontations of the 1960's pre-
sented new challenges, both to free speech and to an orderly society.
In Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 559, 578 (1965), Justice Black empha-
sized the careful distinction between speech and conduct which he be-
lieved necessary simultaneously to provide protection to the rights of
individuals to associate for the advancement of their beliefs and to
protect the public against incipient and actual violence and intimida-
tion of the orderly functioning of government and the courts. He
wrote:

TUESDAY, APRIL 18, 1972
531
""The First and Fourteenth Amendments, I think, take away
from government, state and federal, all power to restrict freedom
of speech, press, and assembly where people have a right to be for
such purposes. This does not mean, however, that these amend-
ments also grant a constitutional right to engage in the conduct of
picketing or patrolling, whether on publicly owned streets or on
privately owned property. Were the law otherwise, people on the
streets, in their homes and anywhere else could be compelled to
listen against their will to speakers they did not want to hear.
Picketing, although it may be utilized to communicate ideas, is
not speech, and therefore is not of itself protected by the First
Amendment.'
"As the social unrest concentrated in the South in the early 1960's
turned to urban riots elsewhere in America in the late 1960's, many
who feared anarchy were ready to weaken the rights of free speech and
free assembly to re-establish more rigid order. Disorderly conduct and
trespassing convictions appeared frequently on the Court's docket.
Many Supreme Court decisions were misconstrued by large segments
of the public who viewed them either as too restrictive or too permis-
sive, depending upon their individual persuasions. In Gregory v. Chi-
cago, 394 U.S. 111, 120, 125–26 (1969), Justice Black again attempted
to find the safe channel between speech and conduct, between rights pro-
tected by the First Amendment and actions subject to legislative regu-
lation. Comedian Dick Gregory had conducted an orderly march
through Chicago in the face of hecklers. The Illinois courts had found
that he had been completely law-abiding until ploicemen, concerned
that the hecklers would provoke a breach of the peace, had ordered
Gregory and his demonstrators to disperse. When they failed to leave,
they were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct. Concurring
in the Court's opinion reversing the conviction, Justice Black said:
"[U]nder our democratic system of government, lawmaking
is not entrusted to the moment-to-moment judgment of the police-
man on his beat. Laws, that is valid laws, are to be made by repre-
sentatives chosen to make laws for the future, not by police officers
whose duty is to enforce laws already enacted and to make arrests
only for conduct already made criminal *** To let a policeman's
command become equivalent to a criminal statute comes danger-
ously near making our government one of men rather than of
laws."
However, Justice Black offset his concurrence in the reversal of Greg-
ory's conviction with a clear warning that in his view conduct can
be and should be regulated to protect other people, their families, their
homes and their serenity. In the same opinion he wrote:
""Speech and press are, of course, to be free, so that public mat-
ters can be discussed with impunity. But picketing and demon-
strating can be regulated like other conduct of men. I believe that
the homes of men, sometimes the last citadel of the tired, the
weary, and the sick, can be protected by government from noisy,

TUESDAY, APRIL 18, 1972
532
marching, tramping, threatening picketers and demonstrators bent
on filling the minds of men, women, and children with fears of
the unknown.'
"Justice Black believed that the First Amendment was designed to
protect individual men. He was unwilling to ‘balance' away the rights
of any individual person for some higher governmental purpose. In
Barenblatt v. United States, 360 U.S. 109, 144 (1959), Justice Black ex-
pressed his belief that the protection provided by the First Amendment
enabling individual men and women to voice their beliefs and ensuring
that other persons could hear the speaker was itself one of the highest
purposes of the Founding Fathers of the Republic. He said:
"[E]ven assuming what I cannot assume, that some balancing
is proper in this case, I feel that the Court after stating the test
ignores it completely. At most it balances the right of the Gov-
ernment to preserve itself, against Barenblatt's right to refrain
from revealing Communist affiliations. Such a balance, however,
mistakes the factors to be weighed. In the first place, it completely
leaves out the real interest in Barenblatt's silence, the interest of
the people as a whole in being able to join organizations, advocate
causes and make political "mistakes" without later being subjected
to governmental penalties for having dared to think for them-
selves. It is this right, the right to err politically, which keeps us
strong as a Nation. ***"
"Justice Black's appreciation of the value to society as a whole
from enforcement of the First Amendment to protect the speech and
writings of one individual is also reflected in his opinions interpreting
the freedom of religion elements in the First Amendment. He gave to
the free exercise and no establishment of religion clauses of the First
Amendment the same sympathetic consideration that he devoted to
the speech and free press guarantees. He treated these provisions as
interrelated devices to protect the American heritage of freedom.
In fact, the decision in Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. (8 Otto)
145 (1878), in which the Court upheld the prohibition against polyg-
amy, even as applied to Mormons who had more than one wife as a
profession of their religious beliefs, apparently led him to the speech-
conduct differentiation which for him marked the limits of the First
Amendment's protections.
"Justice Black sat on the bench during times when religious free-
dom was subjected to intense pressures from competing social forces.
Parochial schools and their sponsors sought public aid to meet the
ever-rising costs of education, while minority religious groups
attacked flag salutes, school prayer services and Sunday closing laws.
These questions were not easy for Justice Black to decide and upon
reflection he was unable to reconcile his first judgment as a Justice
with the First Amendment. Minersville School District v. Gobitis, 310
U.S. 586 (1940). In Jones v. Opelika, 316 U.S. 584 (1942) and West

Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 643-44
(1943), he admitted his error. In his concurring opinion in Barnette,
he expressed his profound respect for freedom of belief and thought.
"No well-ordered society can leave to the individuals an abso-
lute right to make final decisions, unassailable by the State, as to
everything they will or will not do. The First Amendment does
not go so far. Religious faiths, honestly held, do no free indi-
viduals from responsibility to conduct themselves obiediently to
laws which are either imperatively necessary to protect society as
a whole from grave and pressingly imminent dangers or which,
without any general prohibition, merely regulate time, place, or
manner of religious activity. Decision as to the constitutionality
of particular laws which strike at the substance of religious
tenets and practices must be made by this Court. The duty is
a solemn one, and in meeting it we cannot say that a failure,
because of religious scruples, to assume a particular physical posi-
tion and to repeat the words of a pratriotic formula creates a
grave danger to the nation. Such a statutory exaction is a form
of test oath, and the test oath has always been abhorrent in the
United States.
"'Words uttered under coercion are proof of loyalty to noth-
ing but self-interest. Love of country must spring from willing
hearts and free minds, inspired by a fair administration of wise
laws enacted by the people's elected representatives within the
bounds of express constitutional prohibitions. These laws must,
to be consistent with the First Amendment, permit the widest
toleration of conflicting viewpoints consistent with a society of
free men.
"Neither our domestic tranquillity in peace nor our martial
effort in war depend on compelling little children to participate
in a ceremony which ends in nothing for them but a fear of
spiritual condemnation. If, as we think, their fears are ground-
less, time and reason are the proper antidotes for their
errors.

"After his initial uncertainty over the meaning of the First Amend-
ment prohibition on government interference in religion, Justice Black
wrote three landmark decisions on the relationship between Church
and State. His Everson opinion for the Court, holding that New Jersey
could constitutionally pay a school transportation subsidy to parents
of school children, including parents who used the subsidy to send their
children to religious schools, is usually cited as precedent for the limit-
ed nature of governmental power in the area of religious education.
""The establishment of religion clause of the First Amendment
means at least this: Neither a state nor the Federal Government
can set up a church. Neither can pass laws which aid one religion,
aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another. Neither can
force nor influence a person to go to or to remain away from church
against his will or force him to profess a belief or disbelief in any
religion. No person can be punished for entertaining or professing
religious beliefs or disbeliefs, for church attendance or non-attend-

ance. No tax in any amount, large or small, can be levied to support
any religious activities or institutions, whatever they may be
called, or whatever form they may adopt to teach or practice reli-
gion. Neither a state nor the Federal Government can, openly or
secretly, participate in the affairs of any religious organizations or
groups and vice versa. In the words of Jefferson, the clause against
establishment of religion by law was intended to erect "a wall of
separation between church and State." Everson v. Board of Edu-
cation, 330 U.S. 1, 15-16 (1947).
Building upon Everson Justice Black wrote the Court's opinion in-
validating the practice of some schools to release time in the school
day so that students could participate voluntarily in religious activi-
ties within the school building. Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of
Education, 333 U.S. 203, 211, 212 (1948).
""To hold that a state cannot consistently with the First and
Fourteenth Amendments utilize its public school system to aid
any or all religious faiths or sects in the dissemination of their
doctrines and ideals does not, as counsel urge, manifest a govern-
mental hostility to religion or religious teachings. A manifesta-
tion of such hostility would be at war with our national tradition
as embodied in the First Amendment's guaranty of the free exer-
cise of religion. For the First Amendment rests upon the premise
that both religion and government can best work to achieve their
lofty aims if each is left free from the other within its respective
sphere. ***
Finally, in 1962 Justice Black wrote one of the most controversial
opinions rendered by the Court during his first quarter-century as an
Associate Justice. In Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, 433-35 (1962), the
Court held that the Constitution outlawed voluntary repetition of the
New York Regents' Prayer in the public schools of that State. The
opinion reflects Justice Black's deep respect for Thomas Jefferson's
'wall of separation' between church and State and the Justice's own
strong religious upbringing.
"It has been argued that to apply the Constitution in such a
way as to prohibit state laws respecting an establishment of reli-
gious services in public schools is to indicate a hostility toward
religion or toward prayer. Nothing, of course, could be more
wrong. The history of man is inseparable from the history of
religion. And perhaps it is not too much to say that since the
beginning of that history many people have devoutly believed
that "More things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams
of." It was doubtless largely due to men who believed this that
there grew up a sentiment that caused men to leave the cross-
currents of officially established state religions and religious per-
secution in Europe and come to this country filled with the hope
that they could find a place in which they could pray when they
pleased to the God of their faith in the language they chose. And
there were men of this same faith in the power of prayer who led
the fight for adoption of our Constitution and also for our Bill

TUESDAY, APRIL 18, 1972
535
of Rights with the very guarantees of religious freedom that
forbid the sort of government activity which New York has
attempted here. These men knew that the First Amendment, which
tried to put an end to governmental control of religion and of
prayer, was not writtn to destroy either. They knew rather that it
was written to quiet well-justified fears which nearly all of them
felt arising out of an awareness that governments of the past had
shackled men's tongues to make them speak only the religious
thoughts that government wanted them to speak and to pray only
to the God that government wanted them to pray to. It is neither
sacrilegious nor anti-religious to say that each separate govern-
ment in this country should stay out of the business of writing
or sanctioning official prayers and leave that purely religious
function to the people themselves and to those the people choose
to look to for religious guidance."
"We believe that it would be fitting to end this remembrance of Jus-
tice Black as he ended thirty-four terms in pursuit of his constitu-
tional faith with attention to his deep concern for freedom of the
press. His opinion supporting the right to several newspapers to pub-
lish the Pentagon Papers critical of the Viet Nam War was the culmi-
nation of his effort over his entire long tenure to keep the press free
from government interference.
"In Bridges v. California, 314 U.S. 252, 269 (1941), Justice Black's
opinion for the Court upheld the right of an individual citizen vig-
orously to speak his mind to government officials and the right of
newspaper to editorialize about pending lawsuits. He wrote:-
"No suggestion can be found in the Constitution that the free-
dom there guaranteed for speech and the press bears an inverse
ratio to the timeliness and importance of the ideas seeking ex-
pression. Yet, it would follow as a practical result of the decisions.
below that anyone who might wish to give public expression to his
views on a pending case involving no matter what problem of
public interest, just at the time his audience would be most re-
ceptive, would be as effectively discouraged as if a deliberate
statutory scheme of censorship had been adopted. Indeed, per-
haps more so, because under a legislative specification of the par-
ticular kinds of expressions prohibited and the circumstances
under which the prohibitions are to operate, the speaker or pub-
lisher might at least have an authoritative guide to the permissible
scope of comment, instead of being compelled to act at the peril
that judges might find in the utterance a "reasonable tendency"
to obstruct justice in a pending case.'
And in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964), his
concurring opinion expressed his opposition to onerous libel judgments
that might curb the unfettered flow of news to the great detriment of
our free society. His dramatic grand finale, in New York Times Co. v.
United States, 403 U.S. 713, 716-17 (1971), re-expressed much of the
faith he always had in that well worn, dog-eared little paperback book-

let entitled 'The Constitution of the United States of America' which
was seldom out of his reach:
""The Bill of Rights changed the original Constitution into a
new charter under which no branch of government could abridge.
the people's freedoms of press, speech, religion, and assembly. Yet
the Solicitor General argues and some members of the Court
appear to agree that the general powers of the Government
adopted in the original Constitution should be interpreted to limit
and restrict the specific and emphatic guarantees of the Bill of
Rights adopted later. I can imagine no greater perversion of his-
tory. Madison and the other Framers of the First Amendment,
able men that they were, wrote in a language they earnestly be-
lieved could never be misunderstood: "Congress shall make no
law *** abridging the freedom of the press. ***" Both the
history and the language of the First Amendment support the
view that the press must be left free to publish news, whatever
the source, without censorship, injunctions, or prior restraints.
"In the First Amendment the Founding Fathers gave the
free press the protection it must have to fulfill its essential role
in our democracy. The press was to serve the governed, not the
governors. The Government's power to censor the press was abol-
ished so that the press would remain forever free to censure the
Government. The press was protected so that it could bare the
secrets of government and inform the people. Only a free and un-
restrained press can effectively expose deception in government.
And paramount among the responsibilities of a free press is the
duty to prevent any part of the government from deceiving the
people and sending them off to distant lands to die of foreign
fevers and foreign shot and shell. *** 22
"Now the work of Justice Black is done. His constitutional faith
is recorded in over 100 volumes of the Supreme Court Reports, the
3,000 Court decisions on which he voted and the nearly 1,000 opinions
which he wrote, 53 of them in his last term.
"We must, of course, await the judgment of history for a valid ap-
praisal of his work. We need not wait to acknowledge with gratitude
that he was, indeed, one "who tried his dead level best to serve." And
there are many already prepared to join in an admiring judgment
rendered over ten years ago that:
""This man is meant for the ages. No future Supreme Court
Justice, a hundred years hence or a thousand, will ignore with
inner impunity the myriad brilliant insights, learned analyses,
yes, and fervent faiths that mark, in majority or dissent, his
judicial record. The pity is only that Hugo LaFayette Black in
person he of the warm wisdom and the quiet courage and gentle
strength cannot, as will his opinions, live forever.' 28
Wherefore, it is Resolved that we, the Bar of the Supreme Court of
the United States, express our sorrow and deep sense of loss that Justice

should compare the last sentence quoted above with the ballad. "I Am a Dirty Rebel."

Black is no longer with us; we are comforted by the knowledge that he
lived (and knew that he had lived) a full and useful life in which he
served his people and his country with every ounce of the considerable
energy, love and devotion which he could muster; we are strengthened
by his example of courage, discipline, steadfastness and wisdom; and
we are inspired by his enduring faith that our written Constitution, our
Bill of Rights and the rule of law are the best instruments yet designed
for the preservation and peaceful development of the Nation he knew
and loved.
And it is further Resolved that the Chairman of our Committee on
Resolutions be directed to present these resolutions to the Court with
the prayer that they be embodied in its permanent records.
The Chief Justice said:
"Thank you, Mr. Solicitor General, your motion will be granted.
We will now hear from the Attorney General of the United States."
Mr. Attorney General addressed the Court as follows:
Mr. Chief Justice, May It Please the Court:
"The Bar of this Court met today to honor the memory of Hugo
L. Black, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court for 34 years, from
1937 to 1971. Without doubt, he was and will remain one of the most
revered Justices this country has ever known and we can say with
assurance that when the history of the Twentieth Century is written
three decades hence, Hugo Black will take his place among the tower-
ing judicial figures of these eventful times. In recalling Justice Black
we are reminded of the words of Judge Learned Hand in his tribute
to Cardozo: 'He is gone, and while the west is still lighted with his
radiance, it is well for us to pause and take count of our own coarser
selves.'
"The hills of Alabama caught the first gleam of the morning in
1886 and even three quarters of a century later Justice Black would still
describe himself, with characteristic modesty, as a 'rather backward
country fellow.' The story of his journey from Clay County to the
Supreme Court of the United States has been often told; it is a
journey that cannot be measured in time or distance but in accumu-
lated wisdom and experience. On this occasion we can do no more
than note some of the markers along the way: his modest formal edu-
cation and the start of his legal career at the age of 18 when he entered
the University of Alabama Law School; his brief tenure as a judge of
a Birmingham criminal court with petty jurisdiction and his later.
term spent as a prosecuting attorney-experience that provided last-
ing lessons in the operation of criminal procedures and vivid memories
of the plight of the poor and disadvantaged; his general practice of
law after service in the Army during World War II and his effective-
ness in pleading his clients' cases before the jury; his ten-year career in

TUESDAY, APRIL 18, 1972
538
the Senate, where he played an important role in the passage of such
New Deal measures as the TVA, the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935 and the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938; and his dili-
gent self-education resulting in a knowledge both wide and deep.
"All this and much more would have to be taken into account
before any portrayal of the background of the man would even ap-
proach completeness. This we must leave to those who can speak more
intimately. But no matter how brief and inadequate our mention of
his early years, we cannot leave out one essential ingredient that is
infused in everything he did. For in William James' phrase, Hugo
Black "energized at his maximum"-constantly. Once set in motion,
he would not rest until he finished the job at hand. And whatever the
task, whether clearing the docket of the Birmingham criminal court,
or playing tennis on a Sunday afternoon, or struggling with an im-
portant and difficult case before the Supreme Court, he devoted all
the strength and zeal he could summon-and that was considerable.
"Add to this his great courage-the most important of all virtues
because, as Dr. Johnson reminded, without it a man "has no security for
preserving any other"-add to this his great courage to hold true to
his beliefs and it is not at all unusual to find Mr. Justice Black re-
versing, in his first opinion for the Court, no less an eminence than
Judge Learned Hand and, what is more, doing so less than three weeks
after oral argument in a case that can hardly be described as simple.
Federal Trade Commission v. Standard Education Society. 302 U.S.
112.
"During his first Term, in his opinion for the Court in Johnson v.
Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, we can also see the beginning of his relentless
effort to secure the right to counsel for all defendants in criminal cases,
which successfully culminated 25 years later in his famous opinion in
Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335. Johnson v. Zerbst is noteworthy
too for his exhaustive, but succinct definition of waiver as an "inten-
tional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege,"
304 U.S. 464,-a pronouncement that to this day has exerted substan-
tial influence.
"There are many themes that recur in Justice Black's opinions. His
insistence on focusing on what the decision would mean to the individ-
uals affected by it is well-known. See, e.g., Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U.S.
603. 621, 624 (dissenting opinion). He was concerned with setting
down firm and concise rules so that people could govern their actions
accordingly and, just as important, so that judges would not be set
adrift in a sea of uncertainty where, in his words, the 'fundamental
rights of the people [would] be dependent upon the different emphasis
different judges put upon different values at different times.' Konigs-
berg v. State Bar, 366 U.S. 56, 75 (dissenting opinion). To Justice

TUESDAY, APRIL 18, 1972
539
Black, flexibility was not a desirable attribute but a positive evil to be
avoided in dealing with people's constitutional rights. He wrote, for
example, in his dissenting opinion in Braden v. United States, 365 U.S.
438, 445, that “The majority's approach makes the first Amendment,
not the rigid protection of liberty its language imports, but a poor
flexible imitation."
"All who knew him or who have read his opinions are aware of his
penetrating intelligence and of his ability to reason logically and with
force. But Justice Black believed, as he stated only a few years after
he began his career on the bench, that 'Constitutional interpretation
should involve more than dialectics. The great principles of liberty
written in the Bill of Rights cannot safely be treated as imprisoned.
in the walls of formal logic *** Feldman v. United States, 322
U.S. 487, 499 (dissenting opinion). He knew well Dean Pound's ad-
monition that “logic does not give starting points" and, whether the
Bill of Rights or federal legislation was involved, Justice Black ad-
hered to the view that starting points were not to be devised by judges.
Instead they were to be gleaned from the Founders or the legislature,
in light of the language used and its historical background. As he
wrote in describing his constitutional faith, ‘it is language and his-
tory that are the crucial factors which influence me in interpreting
the Constitution-not reasonableness or desirability as determined by
justices of the Supreme Court."
"When he had decided what the Framers meant he maintained that
position with consistency and integrity. Throughout his succeeding
years on the Court, for example, he never departed from the view, first
expounded in Adamson v. California, 332 U.S. 46, 68 (dissenting op-
inion), that the Fourteenth Amendment made the Bill of Rights fully
applicable to the states a view he arrived at through the study of
history and one butressed by the fact that other theories such as “se-
lective incorporation" left judges free to determine what rights were
'fundamental.'
"This is not to say, however, that for him the great constitutional
guarantees were confined within static bounds. Repeatedly, his opin-
ions marked a path for applying the substance of those guarantees to
new factual circumstances that could not have been known to their
Framers. An example is his opinion for the Court in United States v.
Lovett, 328 U.S. 303, which breathed new vitality into the prohibition
of bills of attainder.
"Perhaps he is best known for his position that the First Amend-
ment is an "absolute"-that when the Framers said 'Congress shall
make no law *** abridging the freedom of speech" they meant ‘no
law.' It was in cases involving freedom of speech that he made his most
impassioned arguments, for he was unashamed of human emotions

TUESDAY, APRIL 18, 1972
540
and unhesitant about revealing his own in defense of liberty. Often in
dissent he would chide the majority for employing what he described
as the 'so-called balancing test.' To Justice Black, the Framers had
done all the balancing when they wrote the First Amendment. And
even when his pleas failed to persuade, particularly during the tur-
bulent period of the early fifties, one can still feel in his dissents the
breezes of humanity blowing in to purify the atmosphere and set the
tone for decision in calmer times. Compare Dennis v. United States,
341 U.S. 579, 581 (dissenting opinion), with Yates v. United States,
354 U.S. 298.
"There were qualities about Justice Black that invited further
inquiry by those who did not know him but knew only of him, apparent
paradoxes that vanished as the image of the man sharpened. He had
great warmth and kindliness, but his opinions and his memorable oral
announcements of them in the courtroom resounded with eloquent
indignation whenever a wrong needed righting. He would rigorously
attack the ideas of those with whom he disagreed, but he bore no
personal malice and never spoke ill of anyone. The structure of his
writings is studied simplicity, but for those astute enough to delve
beyond, the vast foundation of the views he expressed is revealed. To
him the law was serious business, yet his sparkle and mirth often de-
fused the charged atmosphere of oral argument. While he strove for
firm and fixed legal rules, he would overrule precedent and uproot
established practice without hesitation in order to fulfill his primary
duty to the Constitution. He was both talkative and a good listener;
intense, but relaxed; and, most of all, gentle in manner but firm in
holding to his beliefs during the ebbs and flows of public opinion
that marked his 34 years on the bench.
"It is perhaps inevitable that the future will see comparisons made
and similarities noted between Justice Black and John Marshall or
Holmes or Brandeis or Cardozo. The attempt is worthy and intel-
lectually fascinating, but in the end it must fail. For Hugo Black
was, above all else, his own man. There have been few judges whose
writings had so many ideas brooding in the background. He has left his
legacy in more than one hundred volumes of United States Reports
and so long as men seek to be true to themselves his light will remain
to guide the way.
"May it please this Honorable Court: In the name of the lawyers of
this Nation, and particularly of the Bar of this Court, I respectfully
request that the resolution presented to you in memory of the late
Justice Hugo L. Black be accepted by you, and that it, together with
the chronicle of these proceedings, be ordered kept for all time in the
records of this Court."
The Chief Justice said:

TUESDAY, APRIL 18, 1972
541
"Thank you, Mr. Attorney General, for the tribute of the Bar of the
Supreme Court to our late brother, Hugo Black. Your motion will
be granted.
"If it is possible to add anything to the splendid tributes to Hugo
Black, in making the traditional response to your presentation, it
seems to me I can do this best by some observations, not primarily on
his stature as a judge, but rather to touch briefly on dimensions of the
man as seen by us and in terms of his personal qualities as a human
being.
"We, who knew Hugo Black well, even though in varying degrees as
to the length of our association, can and do agree heartily with all that
you and the others have said. The intimacy of the daily association of
Justices of the Court is such that, within the Court, each of us acquires
an insight and appreciation concerning a colleague that may not be
paralleled in any other kind of association.
"Even in the intimacy of a law firm each partner does much of his
work alone. In this Court we can only act together, even when we do
not agree. To do our task, we must consult on each step and stage, and
almost daily, as the decisions evolve.
"You gentlemen of the Bar have depicted Hugo Black as he ap-
peared to you, chiefly as advocates see a Justice on the bench, through
his opinions and perhaps through an occasional speech. A law clerk has
perhaps a more intimate view but, at best, that is only a glimpse.
"The tributes you have presented, along with countless other tributes
to Hugo Black over the past 20 years—and with more to come-will
become part of the fabric of the large record of this uncommon man
and part of the literature of the law to which his life was devoted as
an advocate, as a legislator and as a judge.
"There is always a risk of having our admiration for uncommon men
and women create an image that becomes, in time, more legend than
flesh and blood. Hugo Black would not like that. He was surely an un-
usual man, but he was very human. He valued respect, he cherished
friendship, but he would not care for sentimental adulation.
"He would not mind a dash of legend but he was so vital in his
humanity, so firm in his basic views, that he would also want to be seen
and remembered as his intimates saw him; what we saw was a warm,
responsive, responsible person and a passionate advocate of his own
deep felt convictions.
"He made no apologies for having been a politician, which he had
been in the high sense of that word. Nor did he make apologies for
being an advocate and he surely was that. Indeed we who shared the
intimacy of the Conference with him well know his powers of ad-
vocacy, for even when they did not persuade, they shook the positions
of others.
"But even at his most ardent and passionate, he was always ready to
listen and on occasion to change his mind. His was a reasoning mind.

TUESDAY, APRIL 18, 1972
542
Perhaps one of his favorite words was 'unreasonable.' I believe he
ranked ‘reasonable' with 'fair' and 'just.' The combination of those
concepts reasonable, fair, just-made him a tolerant man who would
always listen to others. I can see him now when someone sought to make
a point with him: leaning back in his chair at the bench or in Con-
ference, or in his chambers-head cocked, fingertips touching, his at-
tention focused. Even with his passionate belief in the First Amend-
ment that earned him, with some, the term 'absolutist,' he was care-
ful to distinguish conduct from speech, occasionally to the dismay of
the true absolutists.
"Justice Douglas served with Hugo Black for more than 30 years
and he recalls the toughness and vigor and alertness of Hugo Black's
mind that was matched by his physical alertness. This made him
love the game of tennis that he played until very recent times. Justice
Douglas describes Hugo Black as a fierce competitor, whether in his
days in the courtrooms in Alabama, or on the Senate floor, or in the
Conferences of the Court; he saw no diminution of the depth of his
convictions and the skill and vigor of his advocacy over the years
they sat on the Court together. He describes Hugo Black as 'a tartar'
and a man whose fervor led him to contend for supporters of his
point of view. This fierceness and fervor as an advocate who could
declaim, and even thunder, for his position had another side that
could be seen by his colleagues almost as well in one year as in many
years of association.
"This was the man of the warm smile, the soft southern voice, the
gentle manner. Over their long years together, Justice Douglas saw
him as a man whose friends could do almost no wrong, or if they did,
he would defend them or explain them in an effort of mitigation. In
short, he describes Hugo Black as a man who was no 'fair weather
friend' but a friend for all seasons. This quality made him a friend
to cherish, to consult, to spend happy hours of comradeship with talk
of campaigns fought long ago, cases tried a half century past in Ala-
bama, anecdotes of the great figures of the stirring years he spent in
the Senate and of his early years on the Court.
"Whatever the battles of the past, or struggles over issues within
the Court, Hugo Black carried no bitterness or scars. If any tension.
arose, as it could in the heat of debate with a passionate advocate, it
washed away quickly. As with all of us, he preferred to have others
agree with him, but he did more than tolerate disagreement, he
welcomed and respected it and listened to it.
"On one occasion, Hugo Black and I talked for several hours on a
point that could move him to great eloquence. He could see that I was
not fully persuaded, and as we separated, that wonderful, warm smile

TUESDAY, APRIL 18, 1972

flooded his countenance, his eyes sparkled and he said something like
this:
""Do you know something? You might be right about that, so
stick to your guns. I don't think you are right, but it might turn
out that you are.'
"This was not a pose, or a gesture. It came directly from the well-
springs of his nature. It was an Alabama populist's 20th century ver-
sion of Voltaire's famous dictum. He was a confident man, sure of his
own powers and convictions, but there was a quality of humility that
could be seen in a very short time after coming under his spell. He
would listen as attentively to the newest Justice as to the most senior.
"I found it interesting that Justice Brennan in 16 years independ-
ently identified the same qualities that Justice Douglas observed in
Hugo Black in his association of more than three decades, and they
were the same qualities that others of us could observe in the short span
of a few years.
"Justice Brennan recalls one occasion when Hugo Black was quietly
but firmly insistent on having certain changes made in one of Justice
Brennan's opinions, during the difficult May and June period when
tension and pressure are great and patience is in short supply. Justice
Brennan recalled that finally he spoke rather sharply and pointedly
over the phone to Justice Black generally about the matter of finality at
some point in the process of writing an opinion. Soon after what Justice
Brennan described to me as his vigorous outburst, Justice Black walked
into his office and told him to leave the building-to stay away, say-
ing 'This place can become like a pressure cooker and it can beat
the strongest of men. You should get out of here and forget it for a
few days.' Justice Brennan said he accepted the advice.
"On another occasion, Hugo Black and Justice Brennan were in
disagreement in a First Amendment case and a vigorous exchange
occurred over many weeks. When it was over, Justice Black wrote,
saying:
"Much as I disagree with you, I admire the way you fought for
your position.'
"Of the present court, Justice Blackmun is the most recent member
to serve with Hugo Black, serving one year with him. He recalls Justice
Black coming to his chambers one day to discuss a dissent in which he
was joining Justice Blackmun. His comment was:
""That's the way to do it, Harry-strike for the jugular, strike
for the jugular.'
"Striking the jugular, as we know, does not necessarily cause much
pain, but it can be fatal. This was Hugo Black, the advocate speaking,
for a dissenter is, by definition, an advocate. His dissents were always

TUESDAY, APRIL 18, 1972
544
powerful, they always struck the jugular, and they were often
prophetic.
"I hope I can be indulged some observations on the intimate rela-
tionship I had with Hugo Black from the time I came here three
years ago.
"I had known him slightly after I came to Washington in 1953 and
from arguing cases before the Court. When I went on the Court of
Appeals in 1956, one of his former law clerks with whom I had worked
in the Department of Justice arranged for the three of us to have lunch
together. After that I saw him intermittently and a cordial but not
close relationship developed.
"Sometimes when I would see him at Washington parties, he would
say, naming a particular case,
"I read your dissent. You may be right about that, but even
if you're not, stand by it. Dissents keep the boys on their toes.'
"But when I came to this Court 3 years ago, he was at once both
warmly cordial and helpful in his welcome. I remained in Washington,
as he did, and saw him almost daily. As the senior Justice, he was the
logical member of the Court for me to consult as I tried to adapt my
experience on the Court of Appeals to the work of this Court. We
lunched together often and I found myself not only consulting him
on the steady stream of chambers motions, but on a wide range
of internal matters of the Court's work.
"As time went on during the 1969 Term, he occasionally dropped in
to see me, sometimes as he was leaving for the day. He would vary
between cautioning and scolding me about taking on too much of
the administrative burdens of the Federal judiciary while carrying
on a full load of Court work. Once he said:
""Chief, you've got to let up. Make them get someone else to
do that. Congress has no right to give non-judicial duties to a
Justice of this Court.'
Yet on many sensitive and difficult problems of the Federal system,
his counsel was most valuable to me. He would remind me that Chief
Justice Hughes had said: "This job can kill a man if he is not careful.'
"As a Senator when Hughes was named to be Chief Justice, Hugo
Black opposed the nomination, spoke against him, and voted against
him in a bitter and long-drawn out confirmation battle. A few years
later, he was himself named to the Court in an atmosphere that
engendered controversy at the time. When he came to the Court,
Chief Justice Hughes greeted Black cordially and was helpful in
every way and never alluded to Black's opposition and vote against
him.

"It was characteristic of Hugo Black to say, as he did on several
occasions:
""When Hughes was nominated I thought of him as a big busi-
ness Wall Street lawyer, not much interested in the people. I was
a Senator from a rural state and it was the poor people and small
farmers who sent me here and he didn't seem like our kind of man.
""But I was wrong. Hughes was a fine human being and a fine
Justice, and a great Chief Justice, and we became warm friends.'
"We know how Hugo Black loved good stories, a happy evening
with lawyers and judges. His table, which he and Elizabeth presided
over in my time, was a gourmet's delight. I often teased him about his
lack of interest in wine, since the only wine he cared for was made from
scuppernong grapes that abound in the south. When I discovered this
I kept a supply of it on hand for him. He, in turn, would both tease
and caution some of the rest of us, quoting Chief Justice Hughes'
dictum that judicial work on the Supreme Court never killed any
Justice, but overeating did. When we changed the lunch hour from 30
to 60 minutes, he said he would ‘go along" but he feared we would all
eat too much.
"One fairly recent incident discloses a side of Hugo Black that the
public could not see.
"When we contemplated changing the shape of this bench to make it
easier for lawyers to hear the Justices, and especially for Justices on
the two end seats to hear each other, we arranged to have a full-scale
model of the proposed bench made up in plywood on the same eleva-
tion as we now sit. This model was placed in the East Conference
Room with a lectern in front and our chairs in place. Then one day we
all gathered to make the final decision. As we sat at our places and
discussed the change, Justice Harlan, with the professional advocate's
point of view, said he wanted to see how the bench would look to the
lawyer. He went to the lectern and engaged in a colloquy with those
of us on the bench. Finally, he said he believed it would be an improve.
ment, but then he added:
"There is just one thing I don't like about this."
We all waited, but we could begin to see a twinkle in the Harlan eyes.
Someone said, 'What is it, John?' 'The trouble I see,' said Justice
Harlan, ‘is that the change in shape gives an inordinate prominence
and position to the three Justices in the center section.'
"Hugo Black responded immediately, and the smile on his face
carried out the by-play:
"John, you're wrong-very wrong-it just seems that way to
you because of the distinction and quality of the three men who
sit here.'
"One of the most pleasant memories I have of our informal hours
were those last spring when, on occasion, the Justices had lunch beside

the fountain in one of the courtyards. Since he loved his garden at
home, he seemed to respond to the courtyard setting, and more than
the usual number of stories came forth.
"I never heard him speak ill of any man in any mean-spirited sense.
Occasionally, when the news media would have stories about Justices
or the opinions of the Court that would bring annoyed comments from
Justice, he would say:
"Don't let it bother you. This has been going on a long time.
Those fellows must have something to write about and when there
isn't anything, they have to think something up. Just forget
about it.'
"At the risk of repetition, I would like to close by drawing on what
I started on the opening day of the 1971 Term when we had the sad duty
of announcing that the Court opened without Hugo Black for the first
time in 34 years—a tenure that spanned that of one-third of all the
Chief Justices who presided here since the first session on February 1,
1790.
"In time, I believe, one thing will stand out above all else in Hugo
Black's work and his thinking. Throughout his entire career, he never
wavered in his unbounded faith in the people and in the democratic
political processes of a free people under the American Constitution.
He loved this Court as an institution, he revered the Constitution, he
had enormous respect for the Presidency and high regard for the Con-
gress, but above all else, he believed in the people. He had no doubt
whatever as to the ability of an informed and free people to determine
in their own destinies.
"We will miss his wisdom, his comradeship, and the radiant warmth
of his rare spirit, but to use his own words, 'the Court will go on.'
"Mr. Attorney General, Mr. Solicitor General, on behalf of the
Court, I thank you for your presentations in memory of our late
Brother Hugo L. Black. We accept the resolutions of the Bar and we
ask that you convey to Mr. Louis Oberdorfer, chairman of the Bar
Committee, and all its members, our appreciation for their statements
which will be made part of the records of this Court in perpetuity.”

application for stay presented to Mr. Justice Douglas, and by him
referred to the Court, is denied.
No. A-1090. Curtis Holt, Sr., appellant, v. City of Richmond et al.
The application to enjoin the elections for City Council of the City of
Richmond, Virginia, scheduled for May 2, 1972, presented to the Chief
Justice, and by him referred to the Court, is granted.
Mr. Chief Justice Burger, with whom Mr. Justice Blackmun and
Mr. Justice Rehnquist join, concurring:
"In joining in Mr. Justice Blackmun's concurring opinion in Perkins
v. Matthews, 400 U.S. 379, 397 (1971), I indicated that 'given the deci-
sion in Allen v. State Board of Elections, 393 U.S. 544 (1969),' the
result reached by the Court in Perkins followed. The instant motion
for a stay is not an appropriate occasion to reconsider the holdings in
Allen and Perkins. Hence, I see no alternative but to grant the re-
quested stay of the May 2, 1972, election. Perkins squarely held that
an annexation enlarging a city's number of eligible voters constitutes
a change of a 'standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting'
within the meaning of section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 42
USC § 1973c. That being the case, as stated in the Amicus Memoran-
dum of the United States in the District Court, 'the legal effect of the
... objection by the Attorney General, when coupled with the absence
of a declaratory judgment from the United States District Court,
District of Columbia, is to preclude the city from holding an election
on an at-large basis'."
Mr. Justice White and Mr. Justice Powell took no part in the con-
sideration or decision of this application.
No. A-1096. Terry Brown et al., petitioners, v. A. L. Happy Apo-
daca et al.; and
No. A-1097. David L. Norvell, Attorney General of New Mexico,
petitioner, v. A. L. Happy Apodaca. The applications for stay are

States. The motion of petitioners for leave to file a supplemental brief,
after argument, is granted.

Minor. The motion of the respondents for appointment of counsel is

is hereby, appointed to serve as counsel for the respondents in this
