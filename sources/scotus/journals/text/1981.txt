SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Present: Chief Justice Burger, Justice Brennan, Justice White, Jus-
tice Marshall, Justice Blackmun, Justice Powell, Justice Rehnquist,
Justice Stevens, and Justice O'Connor.
The Chief Justice said:
"Before we open our regular proceedings this morning on this, the
last day of oral argument for the 1981 Term, we pause to note with sad-
ness, the death of our colleague former Justice Abe Fortas in his 72nd
year. Justice Fortas served on this Court from 1965 to 1969 after a rich
and unusually varied experience in government, in private practice and
a variety of activities relating to the law. He served as a legal adviser to
the United Nations Organization and the American delegation to that
Conference at San Francisco, as a visiting professor of law at the Yale
Law School and a periodic lecturer at other law schools. His career in
government at a very early age included service as General Counsel of
the Public Works Administration under President Roosevelt and as Un-
dersecretary of the Interior. After his return to private practice, he
served from 1970 until the time of his death as a member of the very
important Committee on Appellate Rules of the Judicial Conference of
the United States. He had appeared as counsel at this lecturn often,
and his final appearance in this Court was on March 22, 1982-barely
two weeks before his death."
"The record will show that the recess of the Court on this final day of
oral argument of the Term will be in memory of Justice Fortas, and in
the October Term coming, there will be the traditional memorial serv-
ice in this Chamber."

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Present: Chief Justice Burger, Justice Brennan, Justice White, Jus-
tice Marshall, Justice Blackmun, Justice Powell, Justice Rehnquist, and
Justice O'Connor.
The Chief Justice said:
"Today's orders of the Court have been certified by the Chief Justice,
filed with the Clerk, and will not be announced orally."
APPEALS SUMMARY DISPOSITION
No. 79-6584. In the Matter of Sheryl Ann Trapp, etc., Appellant.
Appeal from the Supreme Court of Missouri. The appeal is dismissed
for want of jurisdiction.
No. 81–1738. First National Bank of Saint Paul, Appellant v. Minne-
sota, by Jim Lord, its Treasurer. Appeal from the Supreme Court of
Minnesota. The appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction.
No. 81-1614. Stanley Rosenberg, et al., Appellants v. Johns-Manville
Sales Corporation, et al.; and
No. 81–1615. Jeanne Steinhardt, as Executrix of James McKee, Jr.,
Appellant v. Johns-Manville Corporation, et al. Appeals from the Court
of Appeals of New York. The appeals are dismissed for want of jurisdic-
tion. Treating the papers whereon the appeals were taken as petitions
for writs of certiorari, certiorari is denied. Justice Brennan took no part
in the consideration or decision of these cases.
No. 81-1649. City of Parma, Ohio, et al., Appellants v. Record Revo-
lution No. 6, Inc., et al. Appeal from the United States Court of Ap-
peals for the Sixth Circuit. The judgment is vacated and the case is re-
manded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit for
further consideration in light of Village of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside,
Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. (1982). Justice Stevens took no
part in the consideration or decision of this case.
No. 81-1700. Robert J. Gilliland, Appellant v. City of Palmdale; and
Frank M. Gilliland, Jr., et. al., Appellants v. County of Los Angeles.

MONDAY, MAY 17, 1982
No. 81-6424. Francis Bacik, Appellant v. Pennsylvania. Appeal from
the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania. The appeal is dismissed for
want of a substantial federal question.
No. 81–1731. Adolph Schatzle, Appellant v. James C. Kirkpatrick, et
al. Appeal from the United States District Court for the Western Dis-
trict of Missouri. The judgment is affirmed: Justice Rehnquist, concur-
ring. Appellant in this case requests that we overrule Kirkpatrick v.
Preisler, 394 U.S. 526 (1969). But here the District Court did not invali-
date a reapportionment plan duly adopted by the state legislature; it
merely adopted a plan of its own when the legislature was unable to
reach agreement. This case, therefore, does not require that we ad-
dress appellant's suggestion respecting Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, supra.
No. 81-1752. H. Gordon Howard, Appellant v. Board of County Com-
missioners of the County of Weld, Colorado, et al. Appeal from the Su-

for writ of certiorari, certiorari is denied.

et al. Appeal from the United States District Court for the District of
Minnesota. The judgment is affirmed. Justice Stevens would note prob-
able jurisdiction and set the case for oral argument. Justice Blackmun
took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
