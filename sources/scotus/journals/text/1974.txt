SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Present: Mr. Chief Justice Burger, Mr. Justice Douglas, Mr. Justice
Brennan, Mr. Justice White, Mr. Justice Marshall, and Mr. Justice
Rehnquist.
The Chief Justice said:
"Today's orders of the Court have been certified by the Chief Justice,
filed with the Clerk, and will not be announced orally."
APPEALS SUMMARY DISPOSITION
j
No. 73-711. John Cryan et al., appellants, v. Hamar Theaters, Inc.,
et al. Appeal from the United States District Court for the District
of New Jersey. Judgment vacated and case remanded to the United
States District Court for the District of New Jersey to determine
whether the cause is moot in light of State v. DeSantis, 65 N. J. 462
(1974).
No. 73-7014. George H. Jones, appellant, v. Florida. Appeal from
the Supreme Court of Florida. The appeal is dismissed for want of a
properly presented federal question. Dissenting opinion by Mr. Jus-
tice Brennan with whom Mr. Justice Douglas and Mr. Justice Mar-
shall join.
No. 74-67. Fagan Dickson, appellant, v. Gerald R. Ford and Elmer
Staats. Appeal from the United States District Court for the Western
District of Texas. This is an appeal, assertedly brought under 28
U.S.C. § 1253, from a three-judge court order dismissing a complaint
which sought to enjoin a federal statute upon the ground of its uncon-
stitutionality, 28 U.S.C. § 2282. The court found the case "non-justici-
able" because the appellant lacked standing to sue and because the
case involved a "political question." Where a three-judge court dis-
misses a complaint as being non-justiciable, appeal does not lay to this
Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1253. Gonzalez v. Automatic Employees Cred-
it Union, U.S. (1974). Accordingly, the order is vacated
and the case is remanded to the United States District Court for the
Western District of Texas so that a fresh order may be entered from
which a timely appeal may be taken to the United States Court of
Appeals. 28 U.S.C. § 1291.

The Chief Justice said:
"The Court is in special session this afternoon, to receive the
Resolutions of the Bar of the Supreme Court in tribute to Mr. Justice
Whittaker."
Mr. Solicitor General Bork addressed the Court as follows:
"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
"At a meeting of the members of the Bar of the Supreme Court just
concluded, resolutions expressing profound sorrow at the death of
Mr. Justice Charles Evans Whittaker were offered by a committee,
of which Mr. Samuel Molby was Chairman. Addresses were offered
by Mr. Carl Enggas of the Missouri Bar, Judge Bruce Forrester
of the United States Tax Court, and by Mr. Senator Roman Hruska
of Nebraska.
"The resolutions unanimously adopted are as follows:
We meet to record our respect and regard for Charles Evans
Whittaker, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United
States from 1957 to 1962. His death on November 26, 1973, has saddened
the members of the legal profession, his family, his friends, and those
everywhere who admired and respected him.
Charles Evans Whittaker was born February 22, 1901, near Troy,
Kansas. He spent his early years on his father's farm. In later life,
in addition to recalling the hard work of farming, he also recounted
that he ran a trapline on his way to school. He recalled that his most
frequent quarry was skunks and that while their pelts brought three
dollars each, he also recalled that his popularity at school was not

380
WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1975
enhanced, particularly in the winter when cold weather required the
windows to be kept closed.
His formal education was interrupted after completion of the ninth
grade, and he returned to farming and trapping. The interruption
was only temporary, however, because as soon as he had accumulated
$750, he set out for Kansas City to enroll in the University of Kansas
City Law School.
A high school diploma was a requirement of admission, but Justice
Whittaker convinced the Admissions Committee to accept him on
condition that he complete his high school course simultaneously
with his law studies, which he did.
Justice Whittaker once told an interviewer that he had loved the
law since his earliest recollection and he approached his law school
studies in that spirit.
He was graduated from the University of Kansas City Law
School in 1923 and was admitted to practice before the courts of
Missouri in that year. He immediately joined the Kansas City firm
of Watson, Ess & Gage, for whom he had worked as a messenger
while in law school.
In 1928, he married Winifred Pugh. It was a long and happy mar-
riage, and they were to have three sons, Keith, Kent, and Gary, each of
whom now resides in Kansas City.
He fashioned a successful career at the bar, becoming a partner of
his firm in 1930, and he rose to become a leading trial lawyer in Kansas
City, involved primarily in litigation on behalf of corporate clients.
But he believed, with Mr. Justice Brandeis, that every man owes some-
thing to his profession and he was therefore active in the organized
bar, serving as president of the Missouri Bar Association in 1953 to
1954.
In that year, 1954, he was appointed to the United States District
Court for the Western District of Missouri, and served in that capacity
until June 22, 1956, when he was appointed a judge of the United States
Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.
As a district judge, he continued the hard work and long hours that
had been hallmarks of his practice of law, and he confessed that he was,
from time to time, sorely tempted to descend from the bench and join
in the fray.
Upon leaving the bar and taking his place as a district judge, he
said:
"I now say farewell to the practice of law I have loved so well. It is
a step that one does not contemplate lightly. Yet I do this willingly,
and I hope that there will be no change in me. If you have liked me
as a lawyer, then you should like me as a judge, for I shall not change.
The law has been my life. I wish every man who devotes his life to it
could love it as I do."

WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1975
381
Justice Whittaker served on the Court of Appeals for only one year,
until March 3, 1957, when he was nominated as an Associate Justice
of this Court by President Eisenhower. His nomination was hailed by
the public and the profession alike, and he was quickly confirmed by
the Senate.
He served as an Associate Justice for five years, from 1957 through
1962. During his service on this Court, he wrote 42 majority opinions
and 50 concurring or dissenting opinions.
By training and inclination, his primary interest lay in the field of
commercial law, as is shown by his opinions involving complex tax
issues, such as Turnbow v. Commissioner, and Allied Stores of Ohio v.
Bowers; and in difficult patent cases, such as Aro Manufacturing Com-
pany v. Convertible Top Replacement Company.
His work was not, of course, limited to issues of commercial law or
taxation, and his opinions concerning matters of constitutional law
are found in such decisions as Staub v. City of Baxley, which held a
local ordinance regulating permits for solicitation of membership in
organizations violative of the First Amendment; and Payne v.
Arkansas, which dealt with coerced confessions in criminal cases; and
McNeal v. Culver, concerning the right to counsel.
In the spring of 1962, Mr. Justice Whittaker was advised by his
physician that his health would be endangered if he continued to serve
on this Court. Bowing to that advice, he submitted his resignation
on March 30, 1962, which was acknowledged by the Chief Justice and
his Associate Justices with deep regret.
After his resignation from the Court, he returned to Kansas City.
And in the 2 years following his resignation, he worked actively for
the American Bar Association and also served as a member of the
American Medical Association's commission for the in-depth study
of post-graduate medical education. He contributed his time and his
efforts to several civic and charitable enterprises in the Kansas City
area, including the Kansas City Hospital.
In 1965, he became an arbitrator on behalf of the General Motors
Corporation and was engaged in deciding controversies between that
firm and its dealers.
To the end of his life, Mr. Justice Whittaker continued a deep
interest in the law and in the contribution that courts and lawyers.
can make to the resolution of social conflict by litigation or arbitration.
He frequently expressed his concern about what he perceived to be
an increasing tendency in our society to resort to political or eco-
nomic pressures rather than to the methods of dispute settlements
established by the legal system.
Wherefore, it is resolved that we, the Bar of the Supreme Court
of the United States, express our profound sorrow at the death of

382
WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1975
Justice Charles Evans Whittaker, and our grateful appreciation for
his long years of service in the judicial branch of his national gov-
ernment, and in civil life, culminating with his work as a Justice
of the Supreme Court.
And it is further resolved that the Solicitor General be asked
to present these resolutions to the Court with the prayer that they
be embodied in its permanent records and that copies of these resolu-
tions be forwarded to the widow and to the children of Justice
Whittaker.
The Chief Justice said:
"Thank you, Mr. Solicitor General, your motion will be granted.
I recognize the Attorney General of the United States."
Mr. Attorney General Levi addressed the Court as follows:
"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:
"The Bar of this Court met today to honor the memory of Charles
Evans Whittaker, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court from
1957 to 1962.
Mr. Justice Whittaker's appointment to this Court on March 3,
1957, was the culmination of a distinguished professional career. He
came to this Court with not only an outstanding reputation at the
bar gained as a leading trial lawyer in Kansas City, but also with
prior judicial experience from his service as both a federal dis-
trict judge in the Western District of Missouri and as a judge of
the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Indeed,
he was one of the few members of this Court to have served at every
level of the federal judiciary.
Although his opinions covered the full range of the subject matter
jurisdiction of this Court, Justice Whittaker's primary interest, due
no doubt to his experience at the practicing bar, was in the area of
commercial law. During his tenure as an Associate Justice, he authored
many of this Court's decisions involving federal and State taxation.
In Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company v. Bowers, for example, he
dealt with the subtleties and intricacies of State power of taxation,
measured against the Import-Export Clause, reconciling their com-
peting demands in an opinion for the Court that remains the lead-
ing exposition of that complex subject.
Justice Whittaker drew on his experience as a trial lawyer and
as a district judge in dealing with several important questions of
federal jurisdiction. In Florida Lime and Avocado Growers v. Jacob-
sen, he thoroughly canvassed the legislative history of statutory
provisions and judicial precedent regarding three-judge courts, and in
Hoffman v. Blaski, he provided authoritative guidance for federal
trial judges concerning the transfer of venue provisions of 28 USC
1404. His most significant opinion in this area, and perhaps his most
significant opinion as a member of this Court, was Leedom v. Kyne,

WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1975
383
in which he carefully analyzed the relevant provisions of the National
Labor Relations Act in Title 28 of the United States Code, in sustain-
ing the jurisdiction of federal district courts to entertain suits chal-
lenging ultra vires actions of the Labor Board.
He brought similar penetration, rigor, and respect for the rule of
law to bear in his opinions in Klein, the constitutional safeguards of
liberties to challenged governmental action. In one of his most mem-
orable opinions for the Court, Staub v. City of Baxley, he found
constitutionally invalid a city ordinance requiring a permit for solicit-
ing membership in any organization requiring fees or dues from its
members, in giving the Mayor and City Council uncontrolled discre-
tion to grant or deny such a permit. He wrote for the Court that in
thus making, "the enjoyment of speech contingent upon the will of
the mayor and council of the city, such an ordinance imposes an
unconstitutional prior restraint on the enjoyment of First Amend-
ment freedoms."
Whatever the issue involved, Mr. Justice Whittaker's opinions were
marked by a degree of care and precision that reflected his view that
the law was a calling to hard work, and he once observed that justice.
cannot be produced through any system of procedures alone; in the
main, it must always be the product of long hours of hard, diligent,
painstaking labor by highly competent, experienced, careful and prac-
tical lawyers.
Throughout his career, as both a lawyer and a judge, Mr. Justice
Whittaker adhered to those principles and combined them with a
spirit of cooperation and good will. While always showing esteem for
his brethren on the Court, and sincere respect for their work, he did.
not hesitate to take telling issue on occasions with what he regarded
as analytical shortcomings in the Court's opinions. Examples of this
are his dissenting opinion in James v. United States, analyzing power-
fully and lucidly the tax consequences of embezzlement, illuminating
the basic concept of taxable income, and his concurring opinion in
Gomillion v. Lightfoot, dealing succinctly with the relationship be-
tween the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment claims in that case.
On the occasion of his resignation from this Court, compelled
by his physician's advice, his brethren on this Court, in acknowledging
his departure with regret, wrote to him:
"Our five years of association with you have been in the finest
traditions of the Court, no Justice could have worked harder or in
more complete harmony with his brethren."
As a personal matter, I hope it is appropriate for me to note that
over a two-year period I served with Justice Whittaker on a citizens
commission which explored in considerable depth the problems of
graduate medical education. This was a matter of considerable interest
to Justice Whittaker, and he brought to the work of the commission

384
WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1975
his extraordinary powers of analysis and his determination to think
through the very difficult issues of policy. Working with Justice
Whittaker during this period was a rare experience, which I greatly
value.
I will close with the tribute paid to Mr. Justice Whittaker in the
letter from Phineas Rosenberg of the Kansas City Bar to the Solicitor
General. Mr. Rosenberg wrote:
"My close friendship with Mr. Justice Whittaker began in the
early days of our respective lives and continued for years until his
death. Thus, you can know and understand that my heart is full of
fondest memories of him, which I shall always cherish, of a great
love and admiration of him as a great lawyer, an outstanding jurist,
and a man having the highest concept of honor and integrity, whose
aim in life was to do justice fairly and impartially, and of respect for
his high standards of patriotism. No man had a greater or more un-
restrained love for his country."
May it please this honorable Court, in the name of the lawyers of
this nation and particularly for the Bar of this Court, I respectfully
request that the resolution presented to you in memory of the late
Justice Charles Evans Whittaker be accepted by you and that it, to-
gether with a chronicle of these proceedings, be ordered kept for all
time in the records of this Court."
The Chief Justice said:
"Your motion is granted, Mr. Attorney General, and we thank you
for these statements and tributes of the Supreme Court Bar to our
late brother, Charles Evens Whittaker.
These presentations made here today in his memory will be made
a permanent part of the records of this Court, and we ask you to
convey to the Chairman and the other members of the Committee on
Resolutions our appreciation for their presentation today.
We accept these memorial tributes to Mr. Justice Whittaker made
by you, Mr. Attorney General, and you, Mr. Solicitor General, on
behalf of the Memorial Committee.
You have appropriately paid tribute to Justice Whittaker as a
self-made lawyer who became one of the foremost advocates of his
bar and whose talents were sought by many clients during his years
of private practice.
His high standing as a lawyer was acknowledged by his peers, as
you have already noted, by his election to various offices in the
organized bar.
Of the 100 men who have come to this Court, including the nine
who now hold office, Justice Whittaker was unique in the sense that
his professional career covered the entire spectrum of the practice

WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 19, 1975
385
of law and, in addition, he sat as a judge in all three tiers of the
federal bench.
Those who sat with him could understand readily why he achieved
great success at the bar. He was a perfectionist, with a passion for
the facts of the case, both when he was an advocate and when he was
a judge. And he was never content after he became a judge, until
he had mastered the facts of the case and, in his appellate work, until
he mastered the record.
He drove himself unsparingly in his dedication to achieve that
mastery, beginning with the petition or the jurisdictional statement
and continuing on through to the consideration of the case on the
merits.
Those who sat with him agree that he had few peers in terms of
profound and conscientious application to his daily work. Indeed,
he carried this to a point that was a source of concern to his friends
and to his family, as the work of the Court mounted after he reached
this Court.
His cheerful aspect in the private exchanges with his colleagues
and with members of the bar marked him as a man with a zest for life,
and particularly for the day-to-day interchange and discussion of
points of law.
His colleagues on each of the courts where he served saw him, and
here I use the words of one of the Eighth Circuit judges, "Charles
Whittaker was a good man", and he used this in the sense of the
innate decency and the firm adherence to high ideals in both his private
life and in his public duties.
Few men ever worked more diligently to search out every phase of
the questions which were brought to the Court, and his opinions on
this Court reflect scrupulous attention to details and comprehensive
treatment of all the relevant authorities. He had a firm belief that
the Court should not only reach a correct result, but that it had an
obligation to demonstrate how that result was reached.
His colleagues at the bar, his colleagues on the United States Dis-
trict Court, his colleagues on the United States Court of Appeals, and
the Justices of this Court, and of course his family and his close
associates can appropriately take great pride in his splendid career
as a lawyer and as a jurist."

MONDAY, APRIL 28, 1975
2. That the aforementioned Chapter X Rules and Official Chapter X
Forms shall take effect on August 1, 1975, and shall be applicable to

4. That THE CHIEF JUSTICE be, and he hereby is, authorized to
transmit the aforementioned new Chapter X Rules and Official Chap-
ter X Forms to the Congress in accordance with the provisions of
Title 28, U.S.C. § 2075.
ORDERED:
1. That the rules and forms as approved by the Judicial Conference
of the United States to be known as the Chapter XII Rules and Offi-
cial Chapter XII Forms, be, and they hereby are, prescribed pursuant
to Section 2075, Title 28, United States Code, to govern the forms of
process, writs, pleadings and motions and the practice and procedure
under Chapter XII of the Bankruptcy Act, in the proceedings and to
the extent set forth therein, in the United States district courts, the
District Court for the District of the Canal Zone, and the District

mit the aforementioned new Chapter XII Rules and Official Chapter

Mr. Justice Douglas, dissenting.
As I have said before, "I cannot agree to the Court's submission of
the proposed Bankrutcy Rules to the Congress." 411 U. S. 992 (1973).
I once knew a good deal about bankruptcy law, but I no longer have
the expertise to say whether the proposed rules are good or bad. Be-
cause this Court is no more than a "rubber stamp" I think it should
not participate in the rule-making process. The Judicial Conference
rather than this Court should send these rules to Congress if they
are to be sent at all.

Mr. Solicitor General Bork addressed the Court as follows:
"Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:
The resolutions unanimously adopted are as follows:
The members of the Bar of the Supreme Court have met today to
record our respect and admiration for Earl Warren, who served as
Chief Justice of the United States from October 5, 1953, until his re-
tirement on June 23, 1969.
It is impossible to capsulize Chief Justice Warren's extraordinary
contribution to the life of this Nation, or adequately to express what
he meant to the many millions of people—both in the United States and
elsewhere who knew him or knew of him. Earl Warren's retirement
as Chief Justice represented the culmination of 52 years of official
public service in local, State and National government. His public
service hardly lessened, however, upon his retirement from the Court―
it simply became unofficial. He originally intended to devote his years
of retirement to writing; and, indeed, he completed one book after he
left the Court and made substantial progress on others. In recognition
of the affection and support that he had received throughout the years"
from his wife, Nina Warren, and their large family, he dedicated that
book "[t]o one of the most important segments of our citizenry, the
millions of American mothers--including my wife. Nina-whose fond-
est hope is that their children will be responsible citizens, and whose
faith in humanity and love of freedom sustain their belief that this will
be achieved." 1
Chief Justice Warren's desire for more direct contact with the
people whom he had served for so long and his interest in the youth
of this nation was too great, however, and he spent most of his retire-
ment travelling to colleges and universities throughout the country-
explaining the work of the Court and affirming his faith in our system
of justice, his respect for international law and the role of the United
Nations and his confidence in the capacity of the American people
to assist in the universal realization of all the rights guaranteed by
the Constitution. The richness of his legacy, which even today cannot
be completely appreciated, will undoubtedly ensure him an impor-
tant place among the great figures in our Nation's history.
Chief Justice Warren presided during a period often regarded as
one of the most turbulent in the Supreme Court's history, and it was
perhaps inevitable that the Court's record during those years should
have become so closely associated with him. The decisions handed
down during the period of Earl Warren's service as Chief Justice are
often referred to as decisions of the "Warren Court." Earl Warren.
objected to this characterization. And it is true, of course, that Chief
Justice Warren was only one among nine; ultimately, with only one

vote to cast in conference with his Brethren. Earl Warren was ever
mindful of this fact. Indeed, during the ceremonies attending his re-
tirement from the Court, Chief Justice Warren chose to emphasize
that the Supreme Court had been manned during his tenure by wholly
independent Justices. But he was convinced that this diversity was an
important ingredient of the Court's strength. Speaking extempo-
raneously, Chief Justice Warren noted:
We do not always agree. I hope the Court will never agree on
all things. If it ever agrees on all things, I am sure that its
virility will have been sapped because it is composed of nine
independent men who have no one to be responsible to except
their own consciences."
But Earl Warren's recognition of and respect for the independence
of his Brethren was a foundation for, rather than a relinquishment
of, his leadership role on the Court. Of course, those not privy to
the Court's ultimate deliberations can never know precisely what
occurs there. We do know, however, that during Earl Warren's
tenure as Chief Justice the Supreme Court rendered decisions among
the most important in the Nation's history and that those who served
with him on the Court consistently have acknowledged their great
respect for the strength and effectiveness of his leadership.
During his tenure Chief Justice Warren became the personification
of the Supreme Court. He became the focus for the gratitude of those
who approved of the Court's pronouncements and for the criticism of
those who did not. The simple courage and dignity that he displayed
upon being thrust into this role was of immense public significance,
and was in itself a source of institutional strength.
Like Abraham Lincoln, the Chief Justice was subjected to almost
unparalleled abuse in the conduct of his office. He was a very human
person and these attacks must have made his heart ache, but he never
showed in either his demeanor or his decision making that it affected
his resolve in any way.
The Chief Justice's courage and dignity characterized his entire
public life. Whether as the crusading District Attorney for Alameda
County or the Attorney General of California, or as the dedicated
and innovative three-term Governor of California, Earl Warren had
always refused to compromise principle in the face of public or private
criticism and had conducted himself according to the dictates of his
conscience.
No one who attended a session of the Supreme Court while Earl
Warren was presiding could have failed to be impressed with his at-
tentiveness to the arguments of counsel or to the courtesy and fair-
ness with which proceedings were conducted there under his steward-

ship. He believed deeply that the Supreme Court belonged to the peo-
ple, that its continuing vitality depended in the final analysis upon its
remaining a "responsive forum of last resort. He labored mightily
to make this conception of the Court a reality, and the success of those
labors is reflected in the decisions of which he was so inseparably a
part.
Even the most painstaking efforts to categorize 16 years of Supreme
Court litigation, calling for literally hundreds of thousands of in-
dividual judgments by members of the Court, cannot escape being
inadequate in many respects. We wish, nevertheless, to focus particu-
larly upon three interrelated themes sounded repeatedly in deci-
sions of the Supreme Court rendered during Chie. Justice Warren's
tenure: the concern with ensuring that the civil rights of all the people
would be respected; the effort to strengthen democratic processes of
self-government; and the structuring of an equitable system of crim-
inal justice consistent with elemental human dignity. It was perhaps
preeminently in these three areas that the Warren Court in general,
and Earl Warren in particular, were recognized to be both the prod-
uct and a producer of a profound moral and constitutional revolution.
I.
If one were required to identify a single societal impulse informing
more significantly than any other the development of constitutional
law under Earl Warren, it would be the civil rights movement. The
rising social consciousness of racial minority groups—partially mani-
fest in their demands for equality under the law--was at once the
principal impetus and the result of many of the Supreme Court's de-
cisions during those years. The era began dramatically with Brown
v. Board of Education, which was reargued scarcely two months
after Earl Warren assumed office. The opinion written by Chief
Justice Warren for a unanimous Court in Brown was more auspi-
cious than many observers realized at the time because its reasoning
became the foundation of many other decisions and set the tenor for
much of what was to follow.
Formally at issue in Brown and its companion cases were claims by
Negro plaintiffs that state law requiring racially segregated public
schools deprived them of equal protection of the laws under the Four-
teenth Amendment. For nearly 60 years, such claims had been rejected
on the authority of the "separate but equal" doctrine of Plessy v.
Ferguson. In the several years immediately preceding Brown, how-

ever, the Court's opinion in Plessy v. Ferguson had been substantially
eroded in part because the Court began increasingly to emphasize
the "equal" half of the doctrine in assessing the constitutionality of
racially segregated educational systems. 6 But so long as the "separate
but equal" doctrine retained any vitality, most objections to educa-
tional systems premised upon race could be met at least in theory by
reallocating resources, and without sacrificing the principle of racial
separateness.
One of the impressive aspects of Chief Justice Warren's opinion for
the Court in Brown was its definitiveness. The Court announced that
Plessy had no further application in the field of public education, and
the form of the Court's statement left little basis for supposing that
Plessy would retain any vitality in other contexts:
To separate [Negro children] from others of similar age and
qualifications solely because of their race generates a feeling of
inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect
their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone. ***
*
*
*
We conclude that in the field of public education the doctrine
of "separate but equal" has no place. Separate educational facili-
ties are inherently unequal.
The Chief Justice's opinion in Brown also sounded other notes that
were subsequently to recur. One was its emphasis on the relationship
between education and successful participation in the community's
life and its democratic processes:
Today, education is perhaps the most important function of
state and local governments. Compulsory school attendance
laws and the great expenditures for education both demon-
strate our recognition of the importance of education to our
democratic society. *** It is the very foundation of good
citizenship. ***In these days, it is doubtful that any child
may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied
the opportunity to an education. Such an opportunity, where
the state has undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be:
made available to all on equal terms.
The Court's decision in Brown unleashed a flood of school desegre-
gation cases. Resistance to the decision was massive and immediate;
and in the process of dealing with this resistance, the authority of
the Court was challenged as it had not been since the days of John
Marshall. Had the resolve-or even the unanimity of Chief Justice.
Warren and his Brethren wavered in the face of this resistance, the
results could have been disastrous. But they did not waver: while
permitting a phased accommodation to the basic principles announced

in Brown, bounded by the command that compliance occur "with all
deliberate speed," the Court in subsequent opinions repeatedly re-
affirmed those principles and marked out the area of the constitutional
prohibition of racial discrimination countenanced by state law. One
of the most notable of the school desegregation opinions following
Brown was Cooper v. Aaron. 10 In that opinion, unprecedented in that
it was signed by all nine Justices (including those appointed after
Brown was decided), the members of the Court jointly stated:
It is, of course, quite true that the responsibility for public
education is primarily the concern of the States, but it is equally
true that such responsibilities, like all other state activity, must
"be exercised consistently with federal constitutional require-
ments as they apply to state action. *** Since the first Brown
opinion three new Justices have come to the Court. They are
at one with the Justices still on the Court who participated in
that basic decision as to its correctness, and that decision is
now unanimously reaffirmed. The principles announced in that
decision and the obedience of the States to them, according to
the command of the Constitution, are indispensable for the
protection of the freedoms guaranteed by our fundamental
charter for all of us. Our constitutional ideal of equal justice
under law is thus made a living truth."1
The disposition of the school desegregation cases inevitably under-
mined the legitimacy of other practices premised upon the policy of
racial separateness. During the years following the decision in Brown,
the Court was confronted with scores of petitions involving claims
of racial discrimination in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.
The petitioners in many of those cases sought to overturn state criminal
convictions arising out of their participation in civil rights demonstra-
tions of various kinds. In reversing these convictions, the Court —
often speaking through Chief Justice Warren-progressively nar-
rowed the scope of permissible state involvement in racially discrim-
inatory conduct.
An important example was Peterson v. City of Greenville. 12 There,
the petitioners had been arrested for criminal trespass after having
peacefully integrated a lunch counter reserved for whites in a pri-
vately-owned department store and having refused to leave when or-
dered to do so by the manager of the store. Arguing in support of the
convictions, the state contended that the racial discrimination com-
plained of was the store manager's private policy rather than a con-
sequence of the city's segregation ordinance, and hence that it did not
violate the Fourteenth Amendment's prohibition of state-sanctioned

racial discrimination. Chief Justice Warren, writing for the Court,
rejected this contention :
[T]hese convictions cannot stand, even assuming, as respondent
contends, that the manager would have acted as he did inde-
pendently of the existence of the ordinance. The State will not
be heard to make this contention in support of the convictions.
For the convictions had the effect, which the State cannot
deny, of enforcing the ordinance passed by the City of Green-
ville, the agency of the State. When a State agency passes a
law compelling persons to discriminate against other persons
because of race, and the State's criminal processes are em-
ployed in a way which enforces the discrimination mandated
by that law, such a palpable violation of the Fourtennth
Amendment cannot be saved by attempting to separate the
mental urges of the discriminators.13
The Court reached the same result in Lombard v. Louisiana, 14 even
though in that case there was no state statute or city ordinance for-
bidding the desegregation of restaurant facilities. Chief Justice War-
ren's opinion for the Court in Lombard noted, however, that the
refusal to serve petitioners had taken place against the backdrop of
public statements by city officials to the effect that segregation of
restaurant facilities was city policy and that violations of that policy
would not be tolerated. In reversing petitioners' convictions, Chief
Justice Warren declared that if discrimination mandated by an ordi-
nance may not stand "[e]qually the State cannot achieve the same
result by an official command which has at least as much coercive
effect as an ordinance." 15
Chief Justice Warren's abiding concern to put an end to discrimina-
tory treatment of persons because of their race was also expressed in
his opinion for the Court in Loving v. Virginia.16 At issue in Loving
was the constitutionality of the State of Virginia's anti-miscegenation
statutes. The principal argument advanced in support of the statutes
was that they did not constitute invidious discrimination based upon
race because they applied equally to both participants in an interracial
marriage. Chief Justice Warren rejected this contention, noting that
"we deal [in this case] with statutes containing racial classifications,
and the fact of equal application does not immunize [them] from [a]
very heavy burden of justification" under the Fourteenth Amend-
ment. Turning then to the justifications proffered by the State of
Virginia, the Chief Justice stated:

15 Id. at 273.
16 388 U.S. 1 (1967).
17 Id. at 9.

TUESDAY, MAY 27, 1975
611
There is patently no legitimate overriding purpose inde-
pendent of invidious racial discrimination which justifies this
classification. The fact that Virginia prohibits only interracial
marriages involving white persons demonstrates that the racial
classifications must stand on their own justification, as measures
designed to maintain White Supremacy. We have consistently
denied the constitutionality of measures which restrict the rights
of citizens on account of race. There can be no doubt that re-
stricting the freedom to marry solely because of racial classifica-
tions violates the central meaning of the Equal Protection
Clause.18
II.
Chief Justice Warren-himself a successful Governor and on one
occasion his party's nominee for the Vice Presidency-had an abiding
confidence in the capacity of the American people for enlightened
self-government. He firmly believed that the nation's problems can best
be solved through the political process-so long as that process is in fact
democratic.
It is not, therefore, surprising that in his judgment the single most
important case to be decided by the Supreme Court during the Warren
years was Baker v. Carr 19the first case to hold that the right to
equal political representation could be secured through court action.20
Indeed, as Chief Justice Warren observed following his retirement,
there might well have been no need for a Brown v. Board of Education
if the political process had functioned fairly in the post-Civil War
years:
"[I]f we had the [Baker v. Carr] decision shortly after the
Fourteenth Amendment... most of these problems that are con-
fronting us today, particularly the racial problems would have
been solved by the political process where they should have been
decided, rather than through the courts acting only under the
bare bones of the Constitution. And if the Blacks and everyone
else could vote. . . [and] if we believe in our institutions, and
if we believe that we're all supposed to be equal, every man's
vote should be the same as every other man's vote, and eventually
our problems will be solved in that manner."
"21
Baker v. Carr opened a new era of concern for the fairness of our
political processes. Chief Justice Warren himself wrote the Court's
opinion in Reynolds v. Sims 22—probably the most far-reaching of

the 170 majority opinions he wrote during his sixteen terms on the
Court. The core of Reynolds v. Sims was the holding that the Consti-
tution guarantees equal representation in state legislatures, to be
measured generally by the formula "one man, one vote." The rationale
of the Court's holding in Reynolds was set forth by Chief Justice
Warren in common sense terms that every citizen could understand:
Legislatures represent people, not trees or acres. Legislators
are elected by voters, not farms or cities or economic interests.
As long as ours is a representative form of government, and
our legislatures are those instruments of government elected
directly by and directly representative of the people, the right
to elect legislators in a free and unimpaired fashion is a bed-
rock of our political system. ***

To the extent that a citizen's right to vote is debased, he is
that much less a citizen. The fact that a citizen lives here or
there is not a legitimate reason for overweighing or diluting
the efficacy of his vote. 23
Thereafter, Chief Justice Warren joined in Justice Stewart's opin-
ion for the Court in Carrington v. Rash,24 holding that while a state
can impose reasonable residency requirements for voting it cannot
deny the ballot to a bona fide resident simply because he is a member
of the armed services, and in Justice Douglas' opinion for the Court
in Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections, 25 invalidating state
laws making the payment of a poll-tax a prerequisite to voting in
state elections. He also joined in Justice Black's majority opinions
in United States v. Mississippi,26 holding that the Attorney General
of the United States had the authority to challenge devices utilized
by the State of Mississippi to disenfranchise blacks, and in Louisiana
v. United States, 27 invalidating the "interpretation test" employed in
the State of Louisiana for a similar purpose.
When Congress enacted the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a far-
reaching measure designed to speed the full realization of minority
voting rights in those States and localities in which the problems of
disenfranchisement had been most persistent, it was Chief Justice
Warren who wrote the Court's opinion in South Carolina v. Katzen-
bach, 28 upholding the challenged provisions.
The principal issues in the case turned on the proper interpretation
of Section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment, which gives Congress the
power to enforce the proscription contained in Section 1 forbidding

the States from denying United States citizens the right to vote on
account of race or color. Chief Justice Warren stated that "[t]he
basic test to be applied in a case involving Section 2 of the Fifteenth
Amendment is the same as in all cases concerning the express powers
of Congress in relation to the reserved powers of the States." 29 He
then quoted the classic statement of his illustrious predecessor, Chief
Justice Marshall:
Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the con-
stitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are
plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but
consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are con-
stitutional.30
He concluded with the deeply felt hope that:
[M]illions of non-white Americans will now be able to par-
ticipate for the first time on an equal basis in the government
under which they live. We may finally look forward to the day
when truly "[t]he right of citizens of the United States to vote
shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any
State on account of race, color, or previous condition of
servitude." 31

Prior to his appointment to the Court, much of Earl Warren's life
had been devoted to the administration of criminal justice. His vigor
and even-handedness as a state prosecutor had contributed significantly
to his early electoral successes in California and, to a somewhat lesser
extent, his national prominence. This background gave him an under-
standing of the practical problems of criminal law enforcement that
made him confident that enforcement of the law could be successfully
achieved within the bounds of constitutional restrictions. He deeply
believed that the ultimate protection of our society required that law
enforcement officers, no less than others, be held to observance of the
legal strictures on their conduct.
During Earl Warren's tenure as Chief Justice, an important series
of decisions evolved, almost inexorably, into a principle that the
Fourteenth Amendment's command that "[n]o state shall *** deprive
any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law"
applies in full measure to state law enforcement efforts most of the
more specific constitutional restrictions on federal criminal procedure.
Extensive reform of the Nation's criminal law enforcement has been the
result. If there was an identifiable starting point, it was Griffin v.

E

Illinois. 32 Justice Clark has simply and ably reconstructed the events
from that point:
[Griffin] made a simple demand and one that everyone would
agree had merit. It was that a transcript or authentic record
of some kind should be furnished to indigent defendants on
their conviction and appeal. People with money could get a
transcript and, it was argued, to deny one to the convicted poor
was an invidious discrimination. The Court agreed. I, for one,
never dreamed that Griffin would trigger so many serious con-
stitutional questions under the sixth amendment in such a
short time. Yet in one decade cases were filed in the Court and
decided that overturned our whole concept of criminal justice.
The lawyers reasoned after Griffin: What good is a transcript
to a poor person if he does not have a lawyer?
This led to Gideon v. Wainwright, which required counsel
to be appointed for indigent defendants in felony prosecutions.
The question then posed was: What good a lawyer unless he is
available at every vital point in the prosecution? And Escobedo
v. Illinois, in the very next year, answered: The lawyer must
be available when the suspect is "focussed" upon as the accused.
Finally, the sixty-four dollar question was: When does the
"focus occur? And the answer was: Before interrogation,
which led to the warnings of Miranda v. Arizona. It was writ-
ten by Chief Justice Warren.33
It would unduly lengthen these proceedings were we to attempt to
catalogue more completely even the major decisions of the Supreme
Court under Chief Justice Warren dealing with the administration
of criminal justice. It may be sufficient to recall that the basic reforms
effected during the period invariably had the Chief Justice's full sup-
port-a support that stemmed from his conviction that society's high-
est aspirations could not be realized unless its governors and the gov-
erned alike were required to observe the law. The Chief Justice ex-
pressed this conviction with great eloquence in the opinion he wrote
for the Court in Spano v. New York, 34 a case involving a claim that
the petitioner's conviction had been secured in part through use of an
involuntary confession. The Chief Justice stated that Spano's claim
called upon the Court
to resolve a conflict between two fundamental interests of so-
ciety: its interest in prompt and efficient law enforcement and
its interest in preventing the rights of its individual members
from being abridged by unconstitutional methods of law en-
forcement.

The abhorrence of society to the use of involuntary confes-
sions does not turn alone on their inherent untrustworthiness.
It also turns on the deep-rooted feeling that the police must

obey the law while enforcing the law; that in the end life and
liberty can be as much endangered from illegal methods used
to convict those thought to be criminals as from the actual
criminals themselves.35
As Chief Justice of the United States, Earl Warren was for sixteen
years the principal custodian of the legal institutions and processes
which, along with our right to self-government which he so notably
fostered, are America's most hallowed treasure. He was acutely con-
scious of the magnitude of his responsibilities as Chief Justice, and
for all of those years he devoted his great energies to performing his
responsibilities as Chief Justice as effectively as possible. Only the
most insistent urgings in the name of the national interest-as with
his chairing of the Warren Commission-were permitted to intrude
upon his devotion to his duties as Chief Justice; but even during the
period when the work of the Warren Commission was in progress,
Chief Justice Warren continued his full workload at the Court. Al-
ways, his reverence for the Constitution was the devoted faith of a
man dedicated to two linked tasks-"to *** establish Justice ***
and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity."
Wherefore, it is resolved that we, the Bar of the Supreme Court
of the United States, express our profound sense of loss at the passing
of Chief Justice Earl Warren; we have been made a better People
by the dignity, courage and wisdom that he brought to his duties;
and we shall forever be strengthened in our resolve to respect the
rights of others by his insight that the rights of each of us depend
upon the rights of all; and it is further
Resolved, that the Solicitor General be asked to present these resolu-
tions to the Court and that the Attorney General be asked to move
that they be inscribed upon the Court's permanent records."
The Chief Justice said:
"Thank you, Mr. Solicitor General and I recognize the Attorney
General of the United States."
Mr. Attorney General Levi addressed the Court as follows:
"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
The Bar of this Court met today to honor the memory of Chief
Justice Earl Warren. During the years of his stewardship, which
spanned the 16 terms beginning in 1953, the Court confronted issues
among the most important in its history-issues profoundly affecting
the quality of our lives. Chief Justice Warren brought to this task
human values of inestimable importance: common sense, unswerving
personal integrity, great courage, dignity, an abiding respect for those
liberal and egalitarian tenets that are distinctive features of our con-
ception of government.

Earl Warren came to this Court with almost 35 years' experience
in state government. As a District Attorney and Attorney General of
California he earned a reputation as a firm and fair enforcer of the
law, gaining insights into the practical aspects of law enforcement,
and building a basis for an assured approach—which grew through-
out the years of necessary guidelines for official conduct.
As Governor of California, Earl Warren proposed programs to
promote dignity and opportunity for every individual-programs to
ease the problems of the aged, to provide universal medical care
through a system of compulsory health insurance, and to reduce racial
barriers to full and equal employment.
His success in elective politics was perhaps less attributable to par-
ticular programs than to what a Los Angeles Times editorialist de-
scribed as "the character of the man." He wrote:
Earl Warren is an authentic leader. The people recognize him
as such. In his philosophy of public service he truly represents.
the people as a whole. This, too, the people recognize. He is a
trained, earnest, competent, successful servant of the people.
So, too. the measure of Earl Warren's contributions as Chief Justice
cannot be fully explained or truly appreciated in terms of any par-
ticular decision or group of decisions in which he participated. He
remained throughout his lifetime an "authentic leader," dedicated to
the betterment of the people as a whole. He perceived the cases before
him as human problems. not abstract issues. He clearly understood
the Court had a responsibility to speak not only to the Bench and Bar.
but to all the people as well. His own opinions were written in lan-
guage all could understand—particularly in the most important cases.
Earl Warren's commitment to promoting the dignity of every in-
dividual and his interest in communicating that message to all is sim-
ply, but eloquently, illustrated by his statement in Brown v. Board
of Education that:
To separate (children) from others of similar age and qualifi-
cations solely because of their race generates a feeling of in-
feriority that may affect their hearts and minds in a way
unlikely ever to be undone.
Earl Warren retained a basic faith that the legal process estab-
lished by the Constitution remained the best means of protecting
the individual, thus promoting the public good. He never doubted that
our democratic processes were the best approach to government and
that the inherent resiliency of American life could find solutions
under law for our most serious problems. He believed that individual
citizens, working together, could solve society's most pressing diffi-
culties, that the basic goodness of the people would lead ultimately to
general recognition of humanitarian innovation, and that one of gov-
1

TUESDAY, MAY 27, 1975
617
ernment's principal responsibilities was to remain sufficiently acces-
sible to permit and to foster self government.
His faith, his commitment, his vision of the responsibilities of gov-
ernment were expressed by him after his retirement as follows:
Where there is injustice, we should correct it; where there is
poverty, we should eliminate it; where there is corruption, we
should stamp it out; where there is violence, we should punish
it; where there is neglect, we should provide care; where there
is war, we should restore peace; and wherever corrections are
achieved we should add them permanently to our storehouse
of treasures.
On the Court, Chief Justice Warren drew upon his experiences in
state government in many ways-most notably in his efforts to make
our democratic processes work better. For the individual citizen he
felt the need to review and refine the protective processes of the law
to assure that fairness was more nearly achieved. As he favorably
quoted from Weems v. United States in Miranda v. Arizona:
... Our contemplation cannot be only of what has been, but
of what may be. Under any other rule a constitution would in-
deed be as easy of application as it would be deficient in efficacy
and power. Its general principles would have little value and
be converted by precedents into impotent and lifeless formulas.
Right declared in words might be lost in reality.
He was alert to urge that the constitutional protection offered every
individual be made meaningful by procedural safeguards. Thus in
Miranda, the privilege against self-incrimination was deemed by him
to be secured only if a defendant was informed of his right to remain
silent and to have the assistance of counsel. So also, the Court in
Gideon v. Wainwright reversed its earlier decision and determined that
the right to counsel in a criminal trial is indeed a fundamental right,
because the "right to be heard would be, in many cases, of little avail if
it did not comprehend the right to be heard by counsel."
Chief Justice Warren's emphasis upon the effectiveness of the politi
cal process as essential for representative self government caused him
to characterize Baker v. Carr and Reynolds v. Sims, establishing the
principle of one man-one vote, as the most important in which he par-
ticipated. "I believe," he wrote in 1972, "that if we had the (Reynolds
v. Sims) decision shortly after the Fourteenth Amendment was
adopted that most of the problems confronting us today, particularly
the racial problems, would have been solved by the political process
where they should have been decided, rather than through the courts
acting only under the bare bones of the Constitution." He felt the
Courts had to address the problem of grossly malapportioned state
legislatures because there was no way under the state political process
for the people to correct this condition.

618
TUESDAY, MAY 27, 1975
Implicit in Warren's confidence in our system was the firm belief
that our government is accountable to individual citizens. This is re-
flected in his opinion for the Court in Flast v. Cohen, holding that
federal taxpayers have standing to challenge the constitutionality of
federal expenditures which they allege to violate the Establishment
Clause of the First Amendment. Like the reapportionment cases and
Powell v. McCormack, Flast also exemplifies his efforts to open the
courts and the processes of representative government to wider access.
Chief Justice Warren brought to the Court a perception of the
human and social dimensions of cases. In a speech he delivered in 1965
at a meeting of the American Law Institute, he spoke eloquently of the
many and tragic causes of crime. Among them he included low stand-
ards of law enforcement. He understood the need for determined law
enforcement. In such cases as Terry v. Ohio, which dealt with constitu-
tional implications of police use of tactics of "stop and frisk," he
sought to bring into balance the necessity to protect society and its
law enforcement officers and the rights of the suspected or accused. His
opinions frequently reflected his conviction that it was precisely when
the lawfulness of an individual's conduct was being officially chal-
lenged that the Court's responsibilities as expositor and guardian
of the constitutional guarantees are at their greatest.
Seven years ago, I had the privilege to speak at the dedication of the
Earl Warren Legal Center, in the presence of Chief Justice Warren.
I then said, "In the history of our country the record of the Supreme
Court of the United States under the leadership of Chief Justice War-
ren is unparalleled in the effective attention given to constitutional
doctrines to safeguard the dignity of the individual. The accomplish-
ment is awesome. It ranges from the basic rights of accused defendants,
to the reapportionment of legislatures, to the protection of free speech,
assembly, teaching and association, to freedom of conscience, to the
right to equal education. And any lawyer could add to this list. The
Court has thus been concerned with the well springs of our society ...
But I am sure the Chief Justice would agree that many of the deci-
sions point directions for work which cannot be accomplished by the
Court by itself. New tasks have been presented for the Bar and for
public and private agencies; new responsibilities have been imposed
upon the individual citizens.”
To many in this country and throughout the world, Chief Justice
Warren was a legendary figure: a man who understood and endeavored
to give substance to the aspirations of the poor, the disenfranchised,
the disillusioned. He was a man who remained calm and resolute
in the midst of controversy, and used his craft as judge and states-
man to recreate the ideals we hold as a people. Now his memory towers,
the controversy fades, and history and we can claim him as one of the
great judges who have renewed the strength of our law.

May it please this Honorable Court, and in the name of the lawyers
of this Nation, and particularly of the Bar of this Court, I respect-
fully request that the resolutions presented to you in honor and memory
of the late Chief Justice Earl Warren be accepted by you, and that
they, together with the chronicle of these proceedings, be ordered
kept for all time in the records of this Court."
The Chief Justice said: "Thank you, Mr. Attorney General.
The Court accepts today, with deep appreciation, the eloquent
resolutions of the bar of the Supreme Court and their tributes to
our late brother, the Honorable Earl Warren, Fourteenth Chief Justice
of the United States.
Your resolutions depict so well the unique public life of this re-
markable man that it is difficult to find more to add by way of response.
Perhaps, both for the present occasion and for the future, we can
appropriately add to the general content of these resolutions by draw-
ing on some of our own personal contacts with him in the more inti-
mate relationship that is reserved to those who inhabit this place as
members of the Court.
When Chief Justice Warren paid tribute to his predecessor, Chief
Justice Vinson, twenty-one years ago, he said this of him:
"His life glowed so brightly in all the positions he held with such
distinction that even before coming to the Chief Justiceship he had
devoted practically all his mature life to rendering valuable services
to his country."
Surely those words form a fitting description of Earl Warren's
life and service, as you have summarized them in these resolutions.
There was indeed much in common between the careers of the
Thirteenth and Fourteenth Chief Justices, for each had, in a very
literal sense, given his entire life to his country, foregoing the obvious
success that each would have achieved in private life, with its material
rewards and privacy and freedom from the burdens of public life.
When Earl Warren came to this Court in 1953, it was under the
difficult circumstances that you have alluded to, Mr. Solicitor General
and Mr. Attorney General, arising, as we know, out of the sudden
death of his predecessor shortly before the opening of the term of
Court.
Only those who have been part of this Court's work can understand
the burdens attendant on the opening or the closing of a term of the
Court.
For a new Justice, and particularly for a new Chief Justice, to
assume these responsibilities on one week's notice, four days after
reaching Washington, as Earl Warren did in 1953, after having only
a few days to wind up his affairs and duties as Governor of the great
State of California, was a task of almost overwhelming dimensions.

620
TUESDAY, MAY 27, 1975
But his colleagues of that time watched him make the transition
from executive to judicial office quietly and calmly.
It is sometimes said that we conduct our work in seclusion and
secrecy. And to the degree that this is true, it is simply because there
is no other way the Court can function. That very seclusion, and our
concentration on each of the problems at hand, means that we are
thrown together in a relationship far more intimate than that of
members of the Cabinet, for example, or of the Congress.
By October 1953 the trend for a new social, economic, and political
balance in American life, to which the resolutions have alluded, and
which had begun after World War I and accelerated after World War
II, was ready to press new problems on the Courts in a greater degree
than ever before in our history.
As the resolutions have noted, one crucial facet of the search for
a new balance emerged in the administration of criminal justice. As
we know, few lawyers in America who came ever to this Court had
a broader exposure or better understanding of the day-to-day func-
tioning of the criminal law than Earl Warren.
Because criminal justice has such a high visibility and affects so
many people, and because of the reality that thousands of years of
effort by the human race has not produced effective solutions, there
is a sharp divergence of opinion as to the ways and means to ad-
minister justice, even when there is a consensus on objectives.
The popular wisdom is that justices are constantly locked in mortal
combat with each other, within these walls. When that folklore was
within reasonable bounds, Earl Warren could chuckle over it at lunch
with his colleagues, and, drawing on his lifetime of combat in the
political arena, he would remind them that there would be little to
write about if the Court's work were faithfully depicted. and that
news stories must color the reality to achieve readership. The truth,
he would often remind his colleagues, is that, literally described, our
activities are quite dull, even though not so to us.
In his sixteen years here, there were numerous verbal attacks on
Earl Warren and on the Court. They were not easy for him, for his
family, or for the Court. Yet these attacks helped make him a symbol
of what many others saw as the best about America. And this was
particularly true as to the people in the emerging countries of Africa
and Asia and other parts of the world.
As the resolutions have noted, the Brown holding came in his first
year on the Court. And just as that marked a beginning, not an end,
the changes in criminal law and procedure continued for most of the
sixteen years he presided over the Court.
Fortunately, a new attitude was beginning to emerge in the legal
profession itself towards some of these changes. One example was on

TUESDAY, MAY 27, 1975
621
the right to counsel in criminal cases. For the legal profession, as for
Earl Warren, the holding in the Gideon case, as one example, impor-
tant as it was, presented little or no difficulty. As a prosecutor and
as Governor of California, he had supported the Public Defender
concept.
Sometimes it was said of him that, as Chief Justice, he turned his
back on all that he had stood for as a prosecutor; and of course few
things could be a warmer compliment to a prosecutor who had become
a judge. With Justice Jackson, who was once confronted, I believe, in
these Chambers with a position he had previously asserted as Solicitor
General, Earl Warren could say in effect: "When I was a prosecutor,
I did my duty as a prosecutor; but now I am a judge."
Some people have expressed surprise that in assessing his sixteen
years on the Court Earl Warren ranked Baker v. Carr and Reynolds v.
Sims above even the Brown case, as the Attorney General has just
noted. I have a feeling that he thought the result in the Brown case
was so obvious and so overdue that he did not consider the basic de-
cision a difficult one, and surely it was not a difficult one for him, even
though he was well aware of its importance and conscious that its
implementation would take a long, long time.
This was also true of the Gideon case, whose significance he recog-
nized, but whose result was so clearly inevitable that it gave him no
difficulty. Later, when a unanimous Court decided the Argersinger
case in 1972, extending the Gideon principle to all cases involving
imprisonment, he welcomed that holding warmly.
The reapportionment cases, of course, brought into focus his vast
understanding of the American political process, and with it his pas-
sion for fairness. When we consider that the three areas that domi-
nated the Court's attention during his tenure, as the Attorney General
has pointed out, were: reapportionment, the civil rights of minorities.
and criminal justice, we see that these were the problems that had
engaged his attention for all of his mature life; and in each of these
areas the State of California had worked out solutions that com-
manded widespread and bi-partisan support.
The fact that Justices disagree on the construction of a statute or
the meaning of the words of the Constitution rarely has any effect on
the personal relations within the Court. And with the other Justices,
particularly over the lunch table, he could have a hearty laugh at a
news story depicting two Justices as being enraged over their op-
posing positions.
Perhaps the most difficult adjustment he had to make, and it was
one that he and I talked about on several occasions, was the change
from being a political leader and Governor, where he was free and
even obligated to respond to attack, to being Chief Justice, bound by

622
TUESDAY, MAY 27, 1975
the tradition of silence. Up to 1953, as Governor, he could answer
an attack directly, or he could call on members of his Party or of the
Legislature to state the true facts in response to an incorrect story
or an opposing editorial.
He told me several times how frustrating it was when a false news
account was published concerning the work of the Court, or the activi-
ties within the Court, and he could not pick up a telephone and call
some responsible person to give the facts as an answer, as he was
able to do while he was Governor or Attorney General.
He felt that the legal profession had some obligation to respond
to attacks on the Judiciary, and he pointed to the great work done
by the bar in defense of the Court, when the Court-packing episode
occurred in the 1930's.
I first met Earl Warren in 1945 or 1946, when he was Governor, and
we happened to stay at the same hotel in Chicago, where he was attend-
ing a meeting of State Governors. He was about to have breakfast
alone in the dining room, at quite an early hour, and he asked me to
join him. We quickly reached a topic of common interest concerning
his then current work on correctional problems, and his program to
overhaul the California penal system which was attracting much
attention in correctional circles. He had called in a group of the best
penologists in the United States and asked them to study the prob-
lems of California and recommend solutions. He then secured legis-
lation and appropriations and brought in an outstanding penologist,
Richard McGee, as the Director of penal institutions in California.
He did much the same in improving the California courts, and his
non-partisan, non-political, merit appointments to the bench gave
California one of the best State judicial systems in the country.
Various members of the Court recall personal kindnesses of Earl
Warren, and a few of them will illustrate his thoughtfulness. When
Mr. Justice Stewart was appointed to the Court in 1958, he received
a call from Earl Warren asking about his travel plans and insisting
on sending his car to meet him at the Union Station. When the Stewart
family arrived, sometime before 7:00 a.m. in the morning, they were
met not only by the Chief's car and driver but by the Chief himself.
And that presented some small logistical, practical problems, because
there were six Stewarts in the party.
Another example of his thoughtfulness occurred when he was
arranging to go to Florida for the dedication of a new law school at
Gainesville, named for his old friend, Senator Spessard Holland, with
whom he had worked in the Governors' Conference years before. In
those days of frequent airplane sky-jacking, a government plane was
made available to the Chief Justice for travel. And when he learned
that I was on the dedication program, he called and invited me to
"

TUESDAY, MAY 27, 1975
623
accompany him on the plane. In the course of the trip, we talked about
my view, expressed in a then recent law school lecture, that some of the
changes in criminal procedure, resulting from opinions of the Court,
would perhaps better have been left to the rule-making process.
We discussed my view that this would enable the rules of procedure
to be made on the basis of a broad investigation, rather than on the
narrow record of a particular case. And that it would also have the
advantage of gradually developing a body of support within the legal
profession and the public, affording a greater degree of acceptance of
the end result when it was reached. We did not agree fully by any
means in the course of that two-hour or two-and-a-half-hour plane ride,
but I think each of us returned from the trip with a better understand-
ing of the other's position, and, for my part, a better understanding of
the whole problem as it can be seen only from this Court.
On the day that I was confirmed for this Court, I telephoned and
asked if Mrs. Burger and I could call to pay our respects, which we did
the following day, at the Warren apartment. From that day forward,
his door was always open to me, up to the time of his last illness. He
always responded to my requests for advice and counsel, but rarely ever
volunteered. And his wise counsel was always very helpful to me. He
leaned over backward, sometimes I thought unnecessarily so, to avoid
the slightest appearance of wanting to participate in dealing with the
administrative problems that crossed my desk.
The transition in 1969 presented small problems that would have
been of no consequence if separated from the pressures attending the
final two weeks of the term of the Court. We resolved them over lunch
in several conferences. And I could not help but realize that his de-
parture was, in some respects, as difficult as his taking office in 1953
on four days' notice.
In June 1969, he had presided over the Court for a full year after
he had made the decision to retire, with all the emotional and other
stresses attending such a step. When I asked him if he would adminis-
ter the oath of office to me, and said that I wanted to do it in the Court
in order to emphasize the continuity of the Court as an institution,
at a time when there was far too much loose talk about prospective
changes in the Court, he agreed. And after the ceremony on June 23rd
of 1969, he said to me in the conference room, with great feeling, that
he hoped all of our successors would follow that pattern. Then he and
Mrs. Warren graciously provided a reception in the east conference
room.
In the five years that followed we consulted frequently on the prob-
lems of administration and matters before the Judicial Conference of
the United States. He had enlarged the functions of that Conference,
and he had prevailed upon the Congress to add to it one district judge

624
TUESDAY, MAY 27, 1975
representative from each of the Circuits, an important change that
was long overdue. He had also enlarged the committee structure, so
as to draw nearly 200 judges into the work of the Conference advisory
committees.
When it became clear that a comprehensive program of seminars
for the training of new judges and for all judges on special topics
was not feasible under the structure of the Administrative Office of
the United States Courts, he along with Warren Olney, then the
Director of that office, worked out the blueprint for the Federal
Judicial Center, which has contributed so much to improving the
work of the courts since it began operations in 1968, under the director-
ship of Mr. Justice Tom Clark. That institution, the Federal Judicial
Center, stands as tangible evidence of his foresight and his concern
to improve the work of the courts.
In one of our many talks he commented on how much he enjoyed
the flower beds that had been placed just outside his windows. Knowing
that as a Californian he was accustomed to very colorful flowers
most of the year, I had asked the gardener to put masses of color
in that particular bed. In some way he became aware of this. He then
jokingly asked how I found time to worry about flowers. When I re-
minded him that I walked around the building almost daily to relax
and to relieve my frustrations, just as he went to football games and
duck hunting, he laughed heartily and said: "You'd better find a
bigger place to walk; this place is not large enough to work off the
frustrations of a Chief Justice."
When he came to the Court, Earl Warren, like his predecessors,
Taft, Hughes, and Vinson, divorced himself totally from the political
world in which he had been a foremost figure for three decades, and
devoted all of his great energies to judicial work.
The sole exception in sixteen years, as the Attorney General has
noted, was to accept appointment as Chairman of the Commission to
investigate the murder of President Kennedy. The attacks on the
report of that Commission did not disturb him unduly, partly because
others could and did respond, as he said, and because political murders
were so common in human history that there were always people
around to exploit the conspiratorial explanation. He accepted that
assignment from President Johnson with great reluctance, but he
performed it superbly in the minds of all thoughtful people.
The memorial resolutions have referred to Nina Warren's place
in Earl Warren's life, and in his public career. We on the Court know
her as a most private person, one who planned and dedicated her
life to help him carry the heavy burdens of his public career.
Our response today would not be complete without an acknowl-
edgement of how much his accomplishments were the product of a

truly joint enterprise and, because of Nina Warren, a most happy one.
In an interview shortly before his last illness, Earl Warren made a
statement that expressed the essence of his philosophy. He said: “I
believe that every generation of Americans has a greater opportunity
than those who preceded. I have confidence in our country, in our
people, and in our institutions; and I believe we can and will go on
to still greater things."
It is axiomatic that the life and services of a significant public.
figure cannot be fully or accurately assessed in his lifetime. Not until
the passage of time insulates judgments from contemporary events
can this be done objectively. Yet it is very clear that Earl Warren's
contribution can safely and fairly be assessed now, to give him a fore-
most place among the fifteen Chief Justices and more than eighty
Associate Justices who have served on this Court since 1790. That as-
sessment is bound to grow with the passage of time.
Those who sat with him up to June 23rd, 1969, and those of us
whose contacts with him were chiefly in the five years that followed
mourn the loss of a friend and colleague. Yet even as we do that, we
take pride in his rich life and in his selfless service to our country.
Mr. Attorney General, Mr. Solicitor General, the Court thanks you
for your presentations here today in memory of Earl Warren.
We ask you to convey to the Chairman and to the Committee on
Resolutions our deep appreciation for their work. Your motion that
these Resolutions be made part of the permanent records of the Court
is hereby granted.
Adjourned until Monday, June 2, 1975, at 10 o'clock.
