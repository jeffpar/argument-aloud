MONDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1984
the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
The petition for writ of certiorari is granted. The judgment is vacated
and the case is remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit with instructions to remand the case to the
United States District Court for the District of Columbia for findings of
fact, based on new evidence if necessary, on the question what eviden-
tiary value respondents' and petitioners' statistical evidence has in light

sions that are not actionable in this case. See Pullman-Standard v.
Swint, 456 U. S. 273, 292 (1982). The overall sufficiency of the evidence

Stevens with whom Justice Brennan and Justice Marshall join.

The motion of petitioner for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is
granted. The petition for writ of certiorari is granted. The judgment is
vacated and the case is remanded to the Court of Criminal Appeals of
Oklahoma for further consideration in light of Strickland v. Washing-
ton, 466 U.S. 662 (1984). Justice Brennan and Justice Marshall: Adher-
ing to our views that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and
unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amend-
ments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227, 231 (1976), we would grant
certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case.
No. 83-6413. Christopher A. Burger, Petitioner v. Walter Zant,
Warden. On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Eleventh Circuiit. The motion of petitioner for leave to
proceed in forma pauperis is granted. The petition for writ of certiorari
is granted limited to Question I(B) presented by the petition. The opin-
ion of the United States District Court for the Southern District of
Georgia on this question, which the Court of Appeals adopted without
separate discussion, may be flawed in at least one respect. In judging
the reasonableness of counsel's decision not to present character evi-
dence, the District Court apparently mistook the arguments counsel
made at petitioner's first, ultimately vacated, sentencing for the argu-
ments counsel made at petitioner's second sentencing, the proceeding
whose result is challenged in this petition. Blake v. Zant, 513 F. Supp.
772, 796-798 (1981). Petitioner is entitled to an assessment of his inef-
fectiveness claim unaffected by this, as well as by any other, error. Ac-
cordingly, the judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit with instruc-
tions to reconsider the effectiveness of counsel's assistance at petition-

er's second sentencing and for further consideration in light of
Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. (1984). Justice Brennan: Ad-
hering to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel
and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth
Amendments, Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 227 (1976), I would grant
certiorari and vacate the death sentence in this case. Justice Marshall
would grant certiorari for the reasons stated in the dissenting opinion of
Judge Johnson and set the case for oral argument.
