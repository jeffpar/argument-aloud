Although of opinion that the suggestions filed by the defendant
judge in answer to the motion for leave to file an information for
contempt are inadequate to sustain his failure to impose and give
effect to the sentence as required by our mandate, we nevertheless
deem it unnecessary now to pass upon the application for leave to
file the information for the following reasons:
1. Because the suggestions presented by the judge leave no room
for controversy that his action, although without the limits of his
discretion, was yet based upon a mistaken assumption to the con-
trary.
2. Because we are sure that pointing out such mistake will lead
to a complete and prompt compliance with our former mandate and
render further action upon the motion unnecessary,
It is, therefore, ordered that the consideration of the motion be
postponed until Monday, March 4 next.
