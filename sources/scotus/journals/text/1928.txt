MONDAY, OCTOBER 1, 1928
The Chief Justice announced the following order:
35
It will have been noted that since the close of last term there
have been filed petitions for certiorari to the number of 244. This
has thrown something of a burden upon the court, an anticipated
result of the act of February 13, 1925, in the orderly accomplishment
of its purpose. The members of the Court have therefore during the
vacation, as opportunity offered, devoted much time to the considera-
tion of the records and briefs filed with these petitions in order that
they may be disposed of in the early days of this term.
It was the purpose of the Court to hear one case-the Gilchrist
5-cent fare case-from New York City, to-day and to-morrow, and
to devote the rest of the week to conference upon the certioraris.
By reason the illness of counsel, the Gilchrist case has now been post-
poned for two weeks. This leaves open to us, after we have, in
accordance with custom, paid the respects of the Court to the Presi-
dent of the United States, the entire week for the consideration of
the pending petitions for certiorari, and will enable us on each of
the next four Mondays to dispose of these petitions by granting or
rejecting them.
The Court will now adjourn until Monday, October 8, to begin the
hearing of cases set for that day, and the regular calendar following.
Adjourned until Monday next, at 12 o'clock.
The day call for Monday, October 8, will be as follows: Nos. 9,
original, 34, 3, 11, 13, 16 (and 17), 18, 20, 22 (and 23), and 24
(and 54).

and appellant, v. W. H. Reed, Tax Collector of Adams County, Mis-

treated as an application for a writ of certiorari, there is no Federal
question upon which such a writ can be issued, application for which
is therefore also denied.
The costs already incurred herein by direction of the Court shall
be paid by the clerk from the special fund in his custody, as provided

No. 351. National Surety Company of New York and Fidelity &
Deposit Company of Maryland, petitioners, v. George Jarvis, Treas-
urer of the County of Apache, State of Arizona, etc. The petition
for a writ of certiorari to a decree of the United States Circuit
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is denied. The brief of
counsel for the respondent in this case contains language of which
complaint is made by opposing counsel for the petitioner. The brief
for the respondent betrayed great impatience at the language and
claims of the petitioner's brief, and urged penalty for delay thereby
caused. An examination of petitioner's brief shows no words like
those complained of, and yet the respondent characterizes them most
severely. Because no page references are made by respondent's
counsel to the record in accord with the rules, to sustain his criticism,
and because the brief of petitioner complained of does not contain
the words criticized, we deem it proper to animadvert upon the bad
temper and recklessness of respondent's counsel in making such un-
supported statements. We must insist that arguments in this Court,
either oral or written, though often properly in sharp controversy,
shall be gracious and respectful to both the Court and opposing coun-

sel, and be in such words as may be properly addressed by one gentle-
man to another.
The brief of respondent in this case is ordered to be stricken from
the files as not printed in accordance with the rules, and also for
the reasons stated.
Suggestion has been made that there should be issued against the
author of the offending brief in this case a rule to show cause why
he should not be committed for contempt, but it is thought that this
expression of the Court will be sufficient to prevent recurrence.

ORDER
The Court has considered the report of the clerk respecting the
action taken under its order of February 20, 1928, relating to the
balances in his hands aggregating $7,403.49 and composed of monies
14424-28-12

MONDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1928
55
paid in to meet anticipated costs in cases which, although pending
when the payments were made, were finally disposed of before the
opening of the October term, 1922;
And it appearing that the clerk forthwith after the making of
that order gave public notice by publication, as directed therein, to
the effect that all persons claiming to be entitled to any part of such
monies were required to present their claims on or before the 15th
day of May, 1928, and that all such monies to which no valid claim
was presented before that date would be disposed of as provided in
such order;
And it appearing that after the making of the order of February
20, 1928, the clerk ascertained and found the true claimants to items
aggregating $1,914.58 of the monies described in such order and duly
paid the same to such claimants as shown in his report;
And it appearing, as shown in the clerk's report, that two further
items of such monies-that is to say, an item of $381.80 in the case
of State of Louisiana v. State of Mississippi, No. 11, original, Octo-
ber term, 1905, and an item of $2,612.26 in the case of State of North
Carolina v. State of Tennessee, No. 4, original, October term, 1916—
are in a situation which may enable the clerk, if given further time,
to pay the same to the true claimants;
And it appearing that apart from the two items last above specified
there remains in the clerk's hands an aggregate of $2,494.85 of the
monies described in such report, that no claim to any part of this
sum has been made or asserted pursuant to such order and that the
clerk, although making diligent effort to ascertain and find the true
claimants to the same, has been unable to ascertain and find any
claimants thereto;
It is therefore considered and ordered by the Court:
1. The payment by the clerk to various claimants of items aggre-
gating $1,914.58 is approved and the clerk shall have credit accord-
ingly in his accounts.
2. The clerk shall retain for the time being the two items of $381.80
and $2,612.26 before specified and shall continue his efforts looking to
the ultimate payment of these items to the rightful claimants. A
further report on these two items shall be made by the clerk before
the close of the present term.
3. The clerk is directed to pay the sum of $2,494.85, being the
aggregate of unclaimed items, into the Treasury of the United States,
to be there held and disposed of as is now or may be hereafter pro-
vided by law. Such payment into the Treasury shall be accompanied
by a certified copy of the order of February 20, 1928, of the clerk's
report thereunder, and of this order; and when such payment is
made the clerk shall be entitled to credit accordingly in his accounts.

law, and his recommendations for a decree, all subject to examina-
tion, consideration, approval, modification, or other disposal by the
Court.
The special master shall have authority to employ competent
stenographic and clerical assistants, to fix the times and place of
argument, to issue subpoenas to secure the attendance of witnesses,
and to administer oaths when this may be necessary. When his
report shall be completed the clerk of the Court shall cause the same

The special master shall be allowed his actual expenses and a rea-

tion as the Court may hereafter direct. If the appointment herein

ORDER
By acts of Congress January 31, 1928, and April 26, 1928, the
issuing of writs of error by this Court was abolished and such cases
are now made reviewable by appeal but under the same restrictions
and limitations as formerly required on writs of error. To meet
the legislative changes in this and other respects new rules were
adopted and made effective July 1, 1928. In order to prevent baseless
appeals for which there is no jurisdiction, before they are reached
for hearing, appellant is required to file a printed statement disclos-
ing the basis upon which jurisdiction of the appeal is asserted, in-
cluding the statutory provisions on which it is based, the pertinent
pages of the record, the nature of the case, and other specifications
required by the rule. The appellee is given time in which to file
an opposing statement. On the second motion day after the expira-
tion of the period for filing the statements as fixed in the rule, they
are to be submitted by the clerk to the Court. If the Court find that
the statements indicate probable jurisdiction, an entry showing this
will be made in each case. Should the Court find that there is no
showing of jurisdiction by appeal, the case will be dismissed. If the
appeal is from a final judgment or decree of a state court, and
under section 237 (c) the would-be appellant is entitled to have his
appeal treated as a petition for certiorari, the Court will consider
the petition and make proper order thereon.
Upon the printed statements submitted on October 8 under rule 12
the following notations and orders are made:

sires assistance of counsel in respect of the following matters:

certify to this Court questions deemed necessary for the proper deci-
sion of a pending cause?
3. What has been the practice of taxing officers relative to assess-
ments where, by agreement between the parties, the tax laid upon the

total income by adding to the amount actually received by the tax-
payer any tax which another has paid thereon under agreement be-
tween the parties?

ment so that the certificate will show distinctly when the original

cided; and when the appeals to the Circuit Court of Appeals were

No. 358. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, Cleveland, Cin-
cinnati, Chicago & St. Louis Railroad Company, et al., appellants, v.
Anchor Coal Company, American Eagle Colliery, American Rolling
Mill Company. Appeals from the District Court of the United
States for the Southern District of West Virginia. Per curiam:
These appeals have been fully argued and considered, but in the pres-
ent situation we find that they present moot issues and that further
proceedings upon the merits can neither be had here nor in the court
of first instance. To dismiss the appeals would leave the injunction
in force, at least apparently so, notwithstanding that the basis there-
for has disappeared. Our action must, therefore, dispose of the
cause, not merely of the appellate proceedings which brought it here.
The practice now established by this Court under similar conditions
and circumstances is to reverse the decree below and remand the cause
with directions to dismiss the bill. The order will be, therefore, that
the decree is reversed with directions to the District Court to dismiss
the bill of complaint without costs, because the controversy involved
has become moot and, therefore, is no longer a subject appropriate for
judicial action. United States v. Hamburg American Co., 239 U. S.
466, 475; Berry v. Davis, 242 U. S. 468, 470; Board of Public Utility

drino v. Quezon, 271 U. S. 528, 535; Norwegian Co. v. Tariff Comm'n.,
274 U. S. 106, 112. Mr. Justice Sanford took no part in the consid-
eration or decision of this cause.
No. 514. Ohio Oil Company, appellant, v. E. A. Conway, Super-
visor of Public Accounts of the State of Louisiana. Appeal from
the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of
Louisiana. Per curiam: This is a suit to prevent the enforcement
against the plaintiff of a statute of Louisiana (Act 5 of 1928)
amending a prior statute (Act 140 of 1922) imposing a severance
tax on the production of oil as a natural product of the soil. The
prior act fixed the tax at 3 per cent of the market value of the oil
at the time and place of severance, and the amendatory act makes
it a graduated tax ranging from 4 to 11 cents per barrel according
to the gravity of the oil. As applied to the plaintiff's operations
the tax fixed by the amendatory act is about $12,000 more in each
period of three months than the tax under the prior act would be
for the like period. While admitting the validity of the prior act
and declaring a willingness and readiness to pay the tax imposed
thereby, the plaintiff alleges that the change and enlarged tax im-
posed by the amendatory act is invalid in that that act as applied
to the plaintiff's operations contravenes the equal protection clause
of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United

TUESDAY, MARCH 5, 1929
214
States, and also a provision of the Constitution of the State requir-
ing that severance taxes be predicated upon "either the quantity
or value" of the product at the time and place of its severance.
The parties are citizens of different States and the matter in con-
troversy exceeds in value the jurisdictional requirement. On bring-
ing the suit, the plaintiff applied for an interlocutory injunction
restraining the enforcement against it of the amendatory act pend-
ing the decree on final hearing; but the District Court, composed
of three judges conformably to section 380 of title 28 of the United
States Code, denied the application. An appeal from that order
brings it under review.
The application for an interlocutory injunction was submitted
on ex parte affidavits which are harmonious in some particulars and
contradictory in other. The affidavits, especially those for the
defendant, are open to the criticism that on some points mere con-
clusions are given instead of primary facts. But enough appears
to make it plain that there is a real dispute over material questions
of fact which can not be satisfactorily resolved upon the present
affidavits and yet must be resolved before the constitutional validity
of the amendatory statute can be determined.
The statute provides for the enforced payment of the tax quarterly
in each year. If the tax be paid during the pendency of the suit, and
the statute be adjudged invalid by the final decree, the plaintiff will
be remediless. The laws of the State afford no remedy whereby
restitution of the money so paid may be enforced, even where the
payment is under both protest and compulsion.
Where the questions presented by an application for an interlocu-
tory injunction are grave, and the injury to the moving party will
be certain and irreparable if the application be denied and the final
decree be in his favor, which if the injunction be granted the injury to
opposing party, even if the final decree be in his favor, will be incon-
siderable, or may be adequately indemnified by a bond, the injunction
usually will be granted. Love v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry.
Co., 185 Fed. 321, 331–332.
Under this rule and in view of the entire absence under the local
law of any remedy enforceable by the plaintiff if the tax be paid and
afterwards held invalid by the final decree, we are of opinion that the
application for an interlocutory injunction should have been granted,
and that this should have been done upon terms requiring that the
plaintiff (a) punctually and regularly pay the tax fixed by the
prior act, (b) give an adequate bond whereby, in the event the amend-
atory act is adjudged valid by the final decree, the plaintiff and its
surety will be obligated to pay, with interest and without other
penalty, such further amounts as may be necessary, with the prior

TUESDAY, MARCH 5, 1929
215
payments, to satisfy the tax fixed by that act, and (c) prosecute the
suit with reasonable expedition to a final decree.
The order is accordingly vacated with directions for further pro-
ceedings in conformity with this opinion.

the Court with his findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recom-
mendations for a decree-all subject to examination, consideration,
approval, modification, or other disposal by the Court.
The Special Master shall have authority (1) to employ competent
stenographic and clerical assistants, (2) to fix the times and places of
taking the evidence and to limit the time within which each party
shall present its evidence, and (3) to issue subpoenas to secure the
attendance of witnesses and to administer oaths. Depositions of
witnesses residing at any place may be taken upon stipulation of the
parties, or by the mode provided in the rules of practice for the
Courts of Equity of the United States, or as provided by sections 863,
865-867 of the Revised Statutes for the taking of depositions de bene
esse in the District Courts, or as may be directed by the Master.
They may be returned in the first instance to the Master. When the
Special Master's report of his findings of fact, conclusions of law,
and recommendations for a decree is completed, the Clerk of the
Court shall cause the same to be printed; and when the same is pre-
sented to the Court in printed form, the parties will be accorded a
reasonable time, to be fixed by the Court, within which to present
exceptions. The Special Master shall be allowed his actual expenses
and a reasonable compensation for his services, to be fixed hereafter
by the Court. The allowances to him, the compensation paid to his
stenographic and clerical assistants, and the cost of printing his re-
port shall be charged against and be borne by the parties in such
proportions as the Court hereafter may direct.
If the appointment herein made of a Special Master is not ac-
cepted, or if the place becomes vacant during the recess of the Court,
the Chief Justice shall have authority to make a new designation,
which shall have the same effect as if originally made by the Court
herein.

opinion of this Court in the above-entitled cases, announced April 8,
1929, be, and the same is hereby, amended so that the concluding
paragraph of page 6 thereof shall read as follows:
"These writs of certiorari were granted on a petition signed by
counsel for petitioner who did not participate in the trial. It stated
that the cases were of importance and were such a departure 'from
the accepted and usual course of judicial proceedings, as to call for
an exercise of this Court's power of supervision.' But his argument
here was so inadequately prepared and exhibited such lack of fa-
miliarity with the record as not to be of assistance to the Court, and

MONDAY, MAY 13, 1929
284
in the argument of counsel on both sides, who had participated in
the trial below, there was a want of that candor which is essential
to the proper and adequate presentation of a cause in this Court.
The occasion seems appropriate to remind counsel that the attempted
presentation of cases without adequate preparation and with want of
fairness and candor discredits the bar and obstructs the administra-
tion of justice."
