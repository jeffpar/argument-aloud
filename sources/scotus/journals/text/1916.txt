I cannot do this without thanking you for the kindness and con-
sideration which I have received from all the members of the court
during the 14 terms I have had the honor of reporting their decisions.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
CHAS. H. BUTLER.
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES,
October 9, 1916.
DEAR SIR: In informing you of the acceptance of your resignation,
we desire to convey our abiding sense of the courtesy and considera-
tion which you have so uniformly manifested during the many
years in which you have been reporter, and our appreciation of the
zealous purpose to discharge fully your duty which has controlled
you during that long period.
We can not refrain from hoping that the enlarged field of profes-
sional endeavor, the desire to enter upon which has caused you to
sever your official relations with the court, may prove as fruitful in
good results as you expect it to be, and that you may enjoy a long,
happy, and useful life.
Very truly, yours,

is assented to by the counsel for both parties. But as the cases were
called last term and this is therefore the second term at which they
are subject to call, under rule 19 the mere consent of counsel without
otherwise adequate showing is insufficient to justify the granting of
the motion to pass, and it is therefore denied, without prejudice,

showing.
