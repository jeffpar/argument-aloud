OPINION
No. 76–1383. Christiansburg Garment Company, petitioner, v.
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. On writ of certiorari
to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Judg-
ment affirmed. Opinion by Mr. Justice Stewart. Mr. Justice Black-
mun took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.
The Chief Justice said:
"The Court is in Special Session this afternoon to receive the Resolu-
tions of the Bar of the Supreme Court in tribute to our late brother
Mr. Justice Tom Clark. The Solicitor General is recognized for the
purpose of presenting the Resolutions adopted by the Bar."
Mr. Solicitor General McCree addressed the Court as follows:
"Mr. Chief Justice, May it Please the Court:
"At a meeting of the members of the Bar of the Supreme Court this
afternoon a resolution memorializing our regard for the Honorable
Tom C. Clark and expressing our profound sorrow at his death was
unanimously adopted."
The resolutions unanimously adopted are as follows:
"RESOLUTIONS
"The members of the Bar of the Supreme Court of the United States
have met today to record our respect, admiration, and affection for
Tom C. Clark, who served with distinction as Associate Justice for 18
years, from 1949 until his retirement in 1967, and who thereafter served
the public interest with undiminished vigor until the very day of his
death on June 13, 1977.

MONDAY, JANUARY 23, 1978
"Tom C. Clark lived the law successfully, and to the fullest: as a
private practitioner, state prosecutor, federal attorney, Assistant At-
torney General, Attorney General, Associate Justice of the Supreme
Court, and finally, as an active senior judge and a roving ambassador
of justice dedicated to improving the American legal system.
"While easygoing and casual in his ways, he left a monumental rec-
ord of achievement. His legacy includes not only his contributions to
the annals of the Supreme Court, but ranges far beyond the letter of
the law to the improved functioning of the machinery of justice, and
its greater appreciation by judges, administrators, practitioners, and
people throughout the United States.
"Above all, Tom C. Clark gave of himself, with selfless diligence
and devotion, with a genuine care for people's needs, and with a warm
and friendly manner which brought out the best in others and evoked
their loyalty and affection. Never arrogant, pompous, or sanctimoni-
ous, always modest and unassuming, his diaries are writ large in the
hearts of all those who were touched by his radiance over the years.
I
"Justice Clark came to his understanding of the legal process, anu
his easy rapport with its practitioners, from his own experiences in
reaching the legal summit.
"An outgoing Texan, in manner and spirit, he was born in Dallas
on September 23, 1899. He received his legal education at the Univer-
sity of Texas, graduating in 1922. In 1924, he married Mary Ramsey,
the lovely daughter of a Justice of the Supreme Court of Texas.
Mary Clark remained his lifelong companion, whose love and devo-
tion he credited as the inspiration for all his accomplishments in
later years.
"Over fifteen years at the bar of Texas, he became a successful
legal practitioner. During part of this time he worked in his father's
family law firm, Clark & Clark. Later he served as Civil District
Attorney in his home county for six years. His personal charm and
gift for dealing with people propelled him into local politics, which
paved the way for his move to Washington in 1937 at the start of the
second Roosevelt administration.
"In January 1937, Tom Clark reported for work at the Department
of Justice. There he tried wage and hour, war fraud, espionage, and
antitrust cases. His competence, personality, and diligence made for
his rapid rise in the Justice Department. As young Ben Tillman,
Pitchfork Ben Tillman's son, who travelled with Tom Clark all over
the South trying wage and hour cases, once said: "A man who had
invoices spread out all over his hotel bed at night—a man who works
like that deserves to succeed."

MONDAY, JANUARY 23, 1978

"Succeed he did. He worked with the famous trust-buster Thurman
Arnold, heading the Antitrust Division's West Coast Regional Offices,
where he acquired a zeal for antitrust enforcement. Antitrust law be-
came a favorite source of his legal learning, as revealed in his many
antitrust opinions for the Court. In 1943, he became Assistant Attor-
ney General, first in charge of the Antitrust Division and then in
charge of the Criminal Division. There he prosecuted many major
war fraud cases referred to the Justice Department by a junior sen-
ator from Missouri, Harry Truman, who headed a Senate investigat-
ing committee a man whom he later came to call the 'best client of
my life.'
“In 1945, Tom C. Clark was appointed by President Truman as At-
torney General of the United States, the first head of the Justice De-
partment to come up through the ranks. A vigorous Attorney General,
he pressed for active antitrust enforcement, and personally argued
key cases before the Supreme Court. A Texan, he filed the first amicus
curiae brief by an Attorney General in support of civil rights. chal-
lenging racially restrictive convenants, culminating in the 1948 land-
mark Shelley v. Kraemer decision.¹ At a time of domestic insecurity
and strife, dramatized by Congressional investigations, he imple-
mented a loyalty program for federal employees, and promulgated the
first Attorney General's list of subversive political organizations, fol-
lowed by the prosecutions of the American Communist Party leaders.
under the Smith Act. His concern with internal security matters
carried forward into some of the judicial conflicts which would divide
the Court in the years to come.
"As Attorney General, his reverence for the Supreme Court, as an
institution, was profound. He believed that the Attorney General had
a symbolic duty to appear personally before the Court from time to
time to present oral argument in landmark cases. At the opening of
every Term of Court, Attorney General Clark and his top assistants,
dressed in ceremonial cutaways, would show their respect for the Court
by their personal attendance.
II
"Appointed by President Truman as Associate Justice of the Su-
preme Court, Tom C. Clark took his oath of office on August 24, 1949.
His service over the next seventeen years spanned the eras of the
Vinson and the Warren Courts.
"In his early years on the Court, Tom Clark often followed the
leadership of Chief Justice Vinson. He cast not a single dissenting
vote in his first term. At first, he regularly voted with the Truman
1334 U.S. 1, 68 S. Ct. 836, 92 L. Ed. 1161 (1948). See Remarks of Justice Marshall
on Justice Clark at 63 A. B. A. J. 984, 985 (1977).

appointees, disparaged by the Court's critics as the Four Horsemen,
to uphold the constitutionality of the government's internal security
and loyalty programs.²
“But at crucial junctures, Justice Clark declared his judicial inde-
pendence. In the famous Steel Seizure Case 3 in 1952, Tom Clark not
only voted against his 'best client,' the President who had appointed
him, but split with the Chief Justice who would have upheld Presi-
dent Truman's extraordinary exercise of executive authority.
"While convinced of the Government's rights of self-defense
against the Communist conspiracy, Justice Clark perceived constitu-
tional limits on those powers. In 1952, he wrote the Court's unanimous
opinion holding unconstitutional an Oklahoma loyalty oath forcing
state employees to swear that for five years they had not belonged to
any organization listed as 'subversive' or a 'Communist front' by the
Attorney General of the United States. In the Court's view, member-
ship alone, possibly without knowing the character of the organiza-
tion, did not itself prove disloyalty. Such a statutory restraint on
'individual freedom of movement is to stifle the flow of democratic
expression and controversy. . . .
"Similarly, Justice Clark joined the majority opinion invalidating
state sedition laws under the Federal Supremacy Clause.5 He wrote
the majority opinion invalidating a New York City charter provision
requiring dismissal, without notice and hearing, of a municipal em-
ployee who claimed the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-
incrimination in the course of an investigation concerning his official
conduct.6
"Despite his firm belief in strong law enforcement, he authored the
landmark opinion in Mapp v. Ohio, extending the constitutional bans
on unreasonable searches and seizures as a deterrent to illegal law en-
forcement activities by State officials."
"As for the rights of racial minorities, Justice Clark was committed
to ensuring all citizens' rights to equal justice under the law. Not-
withstanding his Texan roots, his 1953 opinion striking down the
Texas 'Jaybird' White Primary 8 gave wide sweep to the concept
of 'state action' to bar evasion of the constitutional prohibition on
discriminatory activities against racial minorities.

"Although a deeply religious man, Justice Clark wrote the contro-
versial 1963 opinion that outlawed Bible reading exercises in the pub-
lic schools as prohibited by the Constitution's ban on the ‘establish-
ment' of religion.⁹
"History will render its verdict on the work of the Vinson and
Warren Courts, as the pendulum moves toward its ultimate balance.
But the annals of the Supreme Court plainly record that Justice Clark
steadily grew taller in office, and kept making important judicial con-
tributions to the Court that he served with such diligence and devotion.
"Transcending Justice Clark's role in the Supreme Court's deci-
sional functions was his tireless effort to improve the American sys-
tem of justice a mission which he carried out for years above and
beyond his Supreme Court judicial duties. To that task he devoted his
boundless energy in his second career, which began upon his retire-
ment from the Court in 1967 to avoid any appearance of conflict aris-
ing out of President Johnson's appointment of his son Ramsey Clark
as Attorney General.
"At the peak of his judicial powers, Justice Clark retired from the
Supreme Court on June 12, 1967, with the blessings of Chief Justice
Warren, who remarked at the Court's farewell ceremonies that 'he has
been a great companion for us, and he departs with the affection of
every member of the Court.'
III
"As he gained confidence and stature in his judicial responsibilities,
Justice Clark devoted more and more of his energies to his consuming
passion—the improvement of our nation's legal institutions.
"To him, the law was far more than rhetoric or abstractions. He be-
lieved that the law remained an empty promise unless the institutions
that administered it were able to deliver justice to all the people effi-
ciently and effectively, and unless the people themselves appreciated
and understood the role of their legal institutions in a democratic
society.
"His warm personality and easy charm, gracing a missionary zeal to
improve the administration of justice, ideally suited him to his task.
He was at home among judges and lawyers everywhere; he addressed
hundreds of bar associations; he participated in countless committees,
seminars, and programs. His ready smile, his colorful bow-ties, his
corny automatic alarm watch, became legendary at conventions, ban-
quets, and meetings everywhere. He drove himself untiringly; he
worked on nights and weekends; he mobilized funds and people in
support of his causes.

ing "a place in the life of its possessor parallel to that filled by the orthodox belief in God
of one who clearly qualifies for the exemption”).

MONDAY, JANUARY 23, 1978
"His ceaseless travels criss-crossed the country to spread the gospel,
and to lend the Supreme Court's prestige to noble causes. He spoke to
citizens' conferences, Boy Scout meetings, students in grade and high
schools throughout the nation, to broaden their understanding of the
American system of justice and the role of law in a democratic society.
"Justice Clark was a fervent advocate of the merit selection of
judges, a cause for which he provided institutional leadership as
Chairman of the Board of the American Judicature Society.
"A champion of upgrading professional discipline and ethics, Jus-
tice Clark was Chairman of a Special Committee of the American Bar
Association whose recommendations for strong self-disciplinary ma-
chinery sought to enhance public confidence in the integrity of the
legal process.
"But his prime preoccupation was the improvement of the judicial
system and its administration. In 1956, he became Chairman of the
American Bar Association's Section of Judicial Administration, which
served as a platform for the coordination of the federal and state
judiciary in joint efforts to improve the machinery of justice. He met
with state chief justices to identify their problems and work toward
effective solutions. He organized state trial judges in common efforts
to modernize courts, culminating in the ABA's National Conference
of State Trial Judges in 1958. In 1961, the Joint Committee for the
Effective Administration of Justice unified and mobilized the efforts
of the leading national organizations working toward the improve-
ment of the quality of justice. He served as the Joint Committee's
Chairman, driving force, and guiding light. The Joint Committee
organized state and regional training seminars, which highlighted the
need for an enlarged and permanent program of continuing education
for state judges. Under Justice Clark's leadership, The National
Judicial College (formerly the National College of the State Ju-
diciary) was born. The College has issued certificates of completion
to over 7500 judges, and has expanded its programs to include ap-
pellate court judges, as well as administrative law and special court
judges.
"After his retirement from the Court in 1967, his activities never
slowed. As a senior judge, he sat on the Courts of Appeals in all eleven
circuits. He even held trial in district court.
"Justice Clark also became the first Director of the Federal Judi-
cial Center, which pioneered judicial training programs everywhere.
Chief Justice Warren aptly remarked, 'It is almost as though his
entire career had been preparing him for the mission of the Center.' 10
"He was truly a leader of the legal profession. In 1962, he received
the American Bar Association's Gold Medal, the ABA's highest award
10 Address before the American Law Institute, Washington, D.C., May 21, 1968.

for meritorious service. As Justice Powell once said, 'It is likely that
Mr. Justice Clark was known personally and admired by more law-
yers, law professors, and judges than any justice in the history of the
Supreme Court of the United States.' 11
"His monumental achievements have made the law a living reality,
by elevating the quality of justice through better performance by
judges, practitioners, and every participant in the legal process.
IV
"Above all, in the final reckoning, underneath the robe and the high
office, was Tom Clark, the gentle man who cared, and who loved people.
"As his son Ramsey observed in his memorable eulogy for his father,
'the best man [he had] every known':
'People come first. He wants to do things that are good for
people. He knows it will be possible only with reason, tolerance,
gentleness, and perseverance. A wholly constructive human being,
a man of giant and gentle strength; a man who works from morn-
ing to night—not for work, or as an end in itself. Meaningful
work, well done. . . .
'He always has a good word. Around him let no evil be
spoken of any person.'
"His efforts were not reserved for the high and mighty. He did not
condescend to people; he was everyone's friend. At the Justice Depart-
ment, he promoted the interests of career employees and civil servants.
He pushed for the desegregation of bar associations. At the Court, he
befriended every secretary, messenger, guard, and barber, and was in-
terested in their families and their problems. He personally wrote out
and answered every note and Christmas card. He remembered birth-
days and anniversaries. He responded to thank-you notes with thank-
you notes. His hand-written cards, signed T. C. C., were received and
treasured by thousands who knew that he cared.
"His chambers at the Court became the home of his judicial family.
Alice O'Donnell, who he graciously called 'Miss Alice,' was a peren-
nially youthful fount of efficient cheer for judges, lawyers, law clerks,
and wayfaring strangers. Oscar was the Court's most pampered mes-
senger. Every Clark law clerk became a Clark family member, who
shared Justice Clark's confidences and soul-searching in the decisional
process. He did not summon his law clerks, but always visited with
them. One of them recalls, typically, being welcomed by the Justice to
his new duties with the words, 'you treat me as your father, and I'll
treat you as my son. If you ever need anything, you just whistle.' Jus-
tice Clark's law clerks joined the Clark family for Thanksgiving din-

ners. He drove by their homes in his battered Oldsmobile, visited their
wives at the hospital, and godfathered their children. They responded
with a fierce loyalty and affection.
"The Clark Law Clerks have recently founded a Justice Tom C.
Clark Memorial Judicial Fellowship, to honor and continue Justice
Clark's work as a ‘living memorial' for the improvement of justice.
"As he walks into the eternal sunset, the friendly Texan who grew
taller and taller over the years will remain among us forever as a
good man and as a gentle spirit."

"Resolved, That we, the Bar of the Supreme Court of the United
States, express our profound sorrow at the passing of Associate Jus-
tice Tom C. Clark, declare our deep gratitude for his great contribu-
tions to the legal system of the United States, and record our appreci-

all of us; and it is further
"Resolved, That the Solicitor General be asked to present these
Resolutions to the Court and that the Attorney General be asked to
move that they be inscribed upon the Court's permanent records."
The Chief Justice said:
"Thank you, Mr. Solicitor General, and I recognize the Attorney
General of the United States."
Mr. Attorney General addressed the Court as follows:
"Mr. Chief Justice, and May it Please the Court:
The Bar of the Court met today to honor the memory of Tom C.
Clark, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court from 1949 to 1967.
Mr. Justice Clark sat on this Court for eighteen of the most chal-
lenging and turbulent years of the law in modern America. It was
a time when this Court found itself at the vortex of nearly every
social upheaval of its day, and few citizens were untouched in their
daily lives by its decisions. In 1949, when Tom Clark took his seat,
segregation was the law of the land; defendants in state courts could
be convicted on evidence seized with no regard for the protection of
the Fourth Amendment; school children participated in daily reli-
gious observances; indigent citizens were regularly denied rights avail-
able to those who could afford to pay; states could ban the commercial
expression of views they found "sacrilegious;" citizens who espoused
unpopular political beliefs found themselves distant from the sanc-
tuary of the law.
When Mr. Justice Clark retired in 1967, these wrongs had been
banished by a Court that found them unable to survive the bright

and healing light of the Constitution. Time after time, Mr. Justice.
Clark spoke for this Court as it set aright these injustices.¹
The years of Tom Clark's tenure were truly years of revolution.
in American life-a revolution brought about not by force, but by
the utter and irrevocable shift in fundamental concepts of justice.
During these years, Mr. Justice Clark was a sturdy linchpin of this
Court, a conciliatory and centripetal force.
He was a man whose humanity and common sense and deep con-
cern for his fellow citizen made him a natural spokesman for the
Court in those decisions which touched so many common people. He
calmly and forthrightly expressed his dissent when he believed the
Court had gone too far or too fast, but it is a measure of his achieve-
ment that he was never consistently far from the center of the Court
in these often difficult years. Perhaps we might more truly say that
the Court never went far in any direction if Tom Clark was not
there. The keel of a great sailing vessel is not always visible as it
exerts its steadying force, and if occasionally the ship must heel or
pitch in its mighty attempts to follow its course in difficult waters, the
keel will keep it steady. Of Mr. Justice Clark, it may be said that he
was the keel of this Court in difficult waters-sturdy and steady and
indispensable to the integrity of the voyage.
In every area of the law, Mr. Justice Clark's opinions vividly
demonstrate his deep belief that the legitimacy of democratic gov-
ernment indeed, its very survival-depends upon its keeping faith
with the people. "Nothing can destroy a government more quickly,"
he wrote for the Court in Mapp v. Ohio,² “than its failure to observe
its own laws, or worse, its disregard of the charter of its own
existence."
When he was Attorney General, Tom Clark promulgated the At-
torney General's list of subversive organizations; he remained gen-
uinely concerned over the possibility that disloyal Americans might
bring harm to this country.³ But this concern, however heartfelt,
could not move him to retreat from his steadfast loyalty to the due
process of law. In striking down a loyalty oath that the Court thought
too sweeping, Mr. Justice Clark reminded us all: "Democratic govern-
ment is not powerless to meet this threat [of disloyalty], but it must
do so without infringing the freedoms that are the ultimate values of
all democratic living." 4

It was fitting then, that Mr. Justice Clark articulated for the
Court and for the nation-a principle so simple and so just that it
has become one of the foundations of public law-that once a govern-
ment agency or official has set forth regulations, it is not at liberty to
disregard them.5 Few concepts are more necessary to the integrity of
government which Tom Clark so constantly strove to preserve.
Yet Mr. Justice Clark was no foe of strong, effective government.
In his opinions for the Court one finds a realistic recognition, per-
haps nurtured by his experience as Assistant Attorney General in
charge of the Antitrust Division and of the Criminal Division, and
later as Attorney General, that the Executive Branch must be able to
meet new challenges with new solutions. But he was a constant foe of
irresponsible government, and seldom did his opinions for this Court
uphold new governmental approaches to problems wihtout also care-
fully setting down limitations to insure that those powers would be
lawfully and justly exercised." And he was ever ready to extend the
hand of humaneness to correct government action when he perceived
that it was being wielded arrogantly or without compassion.³
⁹
In doing so, Mr. Justice Clark was unfailingly sensitive to “the
imperative of judicial integrity," recognizing that judicial integrity
is fundamental to due process of law and thus to the integrity of gov-
ernment itself. He demonstrated that sensitivity in writing for the
Court in one of its earliest encounters of what has proved to be a
nettlesome and recurring problem-the conflict between the right to a
fair trial and the demands of a free press. One has only to read his
description of the intrusion of the press in Estes v. Texas 10 and Shep-
pard v. Maxwell 11 to realize, as he did, how fragile judicial integrity
can be, and how closely its preservation depends upon the protection
of the rights of the defendant. Every defendant, said Mr. Justice
Clark for the Court, is entitled to "judicial serenity and calm," 12 free
of prejudicial publicity and disruption of the jury's deliberative
process:
"Due process [he wrote] requires that the accused receive a trial
by an impartial jury free from outside influences.... The courts
must take such steps by rule and regulation that will protect their
processes from prejudicial outside interferences. Neither prosecu-

should be permitted to frustrate its function."
Mr. Justice Clark understood well that no government could keep
faith with its citizens without vigorously guaranteeing those citizens
their rights under the law. Throughout his career on this Court, he
unequivocally expressed this Court's dedication to the advancement of
civil rights for all Americans. In his first Term, he voted to reverse the
conviction of a Negro who had been indicted by a grand jury from
which the only Negro known to the white jury commissioners was ex-
cused because he was too old to serve. Said Mr. Justice Clark, with
characteristic directness, "[The commissioners'] responsibility was to
learn whether there were persons among the Negroes they did not
know who were qualified and available for service." 14
15
His opinion for the court in Burton v. Wilmington Parking Author-
ity, as every judge and lawyer knows, gave new meaning to the
concept of "state action" at a crucial time in our history, when the
Fourteenth Amendment was called forth as the law's cutting edge in
the fight against racial discrimination in America. Burton served no-
tice to the States and to all people that public property was no place
for private discrimination.
And Mr. Justice Clark again spoke for the Court in the seminal
cases of Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States and Katzen-
bach v. McClung, 16 the companion cases that upheld the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 in its prohibition of discrimination in public accommoda-
tions and demonstrated unmistakably to the nation this Court's com-
mitment to a "broad and sweeping" 17 reading of the authority of Con-
gress under the Commerce Clause to combat discrimination.
Tom Clark also firmly believed that law and order are the "well-
springs of democracy," 18 and he reminded us that "[g]oals, no matter
how laudable, pursued by mobocracy in the end must always lead to
further restraints of free expression." 19
Tom Clark was a true populist, trusting almost without limit the
goodness of the American people he so deeply loved, and ever suspicious
of those who sought to abuse that goodness for narrow gain. His vision
of the law and his fellow man were seldom in conflict, for, as he once
wrote, "There is no war between the Constitution and common sense." 20
His opinions, like the man himself, were straightforward-never
redundant, never prolix. His style was plain and clear, his language
free of pretense or obfuscation. He admitted doubt where there was

doubt yet explained the Court's reasoning carefully, as if writing not
merely for his fellow lawyers but for all his fellow citizens. Only a
great man can explain so effectively his wisdom without the need to
flaunt it. Tom Clark was such a man.
Indeed, Tom Clark was an uncommon man. Most of us are privileged
to have one and perhaps two careers. He had four. He was a lawyer in
private practice for a time; Assistant Attorney General and Attorney
General for a time, and a Justice of the Supreme Court for a time. But
upon retirement from the Court, he began another career, certainly an
important one. He became the foremost expert in and teacher of ju-
dicial administration in America. It was in judicial administration that
he touched the lives of many young judges. I was among those. He
sent me to the Division of Judicial Administration in the American
Bar to help. I served under him at the Federal Judicial Center. I
worked closely with him in many endeavors.
He was a warm friend. I miss him very much. I miss his wise coun-
sel. One of my first acts as Attorney General was to have his portrait
moved into the conference room just outside my office. I then had him
for lunch to seek his advice and to show him the new location of his
portrait. In typical modesty, he thanked me for taking him, as he said,
out of the basement. His modest manner was given meaning in little
ways. For example, he spent the night in our home in Atlanta and my
wife was shocked to find that he had made his bed before leaving.
On the death of President Lincoln, Tolstoy, the Russian writer and
philosopher, described him as being a great man, and he said that his
greatness was in his life having been rooted in four eternal principles,
humanity, truth, justice and pity. Sandburg recalled this tribute of
Tolstoy in his chapter on the Lincoln eulogies, which chapter is en-
titled "A tree is best measured when it is down." As we measure Mr.
Justice Clark, we can say that his life too was rooted in humanity,
truth, justice and pity.
May it please this honorable Court:
In the name of the lawyers of this Nation, and particularly the Bar
of this Court, I respectfully request that the Resolution presented to
you in memory of the late Justice Tom C. Clark be accepted by you,
and that it, together with the chronicle of these proceedings, be ordered
kept for all time in the records of this Court.
The Chief Justice said:
"Mr. Attorney General, Mr. Solicitor General, the Court thanks
you for your presentation here today in memory of our late brother,
Mr. Justice Tom Clark. We ask you to convey to the members of the
Committee on Resolutions our deep appreciation for these most appro-
priate resolutions."
Your motion that they be made part of the permanent record of the
Court is granted.

MONDAY, JANUARY 23, 1978

The 101 men who have come to this Court since 1790 have each had
much in common because, of course, they were all lawyers; but each of
them has also had some special and unique attributes. With some of
them these special attributes were known before they came here, and
perhaps explain why they were selected. With others the uniqueness
and special attributes emerged after coming to the Bench. And then
Resolutions presented by the Solicitor General and the Attorney Gen-
eral have marked the growth of our late brother, Tom Clark, in all of
his activities.
As they have pointed out, Tom Clark had not one career, but three,
each of which was readily identified. These Resolutions have spoken
eloquently of his work as a practicing lawyer, first in Texas and then
in the Department of Justice. His long tenure in that Department
culminating in his service as Attorney General gave him an insight
into the workings of government surpassed by no man who ever came
to this Court.
Certainly no Justice who sat here had a greater understanding of
the complexities of the Twentieth Century problems of governing a
diverse population of 200 million people. And, as has been said, one
can see this rich background and broad experience reflected in the
practical common sense of his opinions.
A professional career reaching the high post of Attorney General
is ordinarily enough to fulfill the desires and satisfy the ambitions of
any American lawyer; but, as we know, it was only a foundation for
another career as a Justice of this Court. During his eighteen years
here, as the Solicitor General has noted, he participated in some of
the most crucial decisions, not only of our time but in the entire his-
tory of the Court.
There is a cliche that lawyers who are appointed to the Bench from
government service, especially from long service such as he had, have
become infected with a pro-government bias. Tom Clark of course
did serve in the Department of Justice a long time, but his opinions
as a Justice of this Court and later while sitting on the Courts of
Appeals in all of the circuits reveal that old cliche for precisely what
it is. No one can find any evidence of a pro-government bias in Justice
Clark's judicial work.
His service as a Justice has now been eloquently and abundantly
covered in the Resolution of the Bar, but, as the Solicitor General
noted, retirement from the Court after 18 years, covering this extraor-
dinary period in American history, and something that would ordi-
narily be the capping of a great career was the beginning of yet an-
other one, the third one, which, happily for this country, covered
another decade, literally up to the day of his death.
Long before his retirement from this Bench, Tom Clark had be-
come the vital link between the Supreme Court and the legal pro-

406
MONDAY, JANUARY 23, 1978
fession, a link which is indispensable to the effective functioning of
the system of justice in this country. Crucial as is the matter of main-
taining communication with the organized bar, the Justices of this
Court, at least for the past 25 or 30 years, have been faced with such
heavy burdens and constantly increasing dockets that it has been
very difficult for them to maintain the kind of contact they would
like to have with the practicing profession. Not so for Tom Clark.
Somehow he managed to do both.
But once freed from the heavy burdens of serving as a Justice, he
expanded his efforts for the improvement of the judicial system. He
has been described as both ambassador and missionary, and, indeed,
he was both. No problem of the courts, federal or state, escaped his
notice or escaped his powers of persuasion to marshal support for
solutions.
Two particular activities deserve comment, even at the risk of some
repetition. One year after his retirement from this Court, the Federal
Judicial Center was created by an Act of Congress, and it was created
to address the very problems that had engaged his attention and ener-
gies for so many years. The governing body of that Center wisely
selected him as the first Director. It was a case of a man and a position
made for each other; the need, the time and the man coincided.
Even though his tenure as Director was relatively brief, due to the
statutory age limit fixed by the Congress, his contribution was enor-
mous, and all out of proportion to the length of his tenure as measured
by a calendar.
Even as recently as 1968, when the Center was founded, federal
judges were far from unanimous as to the need for a research and
development program on the problems of the courts. And many were
even less sympathetic to the idea of continuing legal education for
judges. But Tom Clark before that time, as both the Solicitor General
and the Attorney General have noted, was instrumental in the de-
velopment of the National College of the State Judiciary, as it was
known at that time, and he knew the value of that institution and of
its educational programs for judges. And that, of course, gave him an
enormously valuable foundation to supply the leadership that was
needed to launch the new Federal Judicial Center, where continuing
education and special training seminars for judges would be a major
factor.
Equally important as his knowledge and experience in how to go
about his new task was the credibility that he gave to this new enter-
prise. I recall one very senior federal judge, a man of large standing
and reputation in the federal judiciary, who, among a group of
judges, expressed skepticism about the need for the Federal Judicial
Center, but then he ended up by saying, “If Tom Clark is for it, it

MONDAY, JANUARY 23, 1978
407
must be sound, and I'm for it." And that was the attitude of the
skeptics, shared by many judges, in 1968.
His term as Director of the Center terminated very shortly after I
came to this office and when, by statute, I automatically became Chair-
man of the Center Board. I note that I share an experience with the
Attorney General, for on the day the Senate confirmed my nomination
I called Tom Clark and asked if he would meet with me and several
others for breakfast on June 24th, the morning after I was scheduled
to take the oath of office in this Chamber. The purpose was to discuss
problems, programs and projects for the future. His typical response
was, "Why not sooner?"
I then explained that I thought since he was still in the office of Di-
rector, and that until July 23rd I was merely a circuit judge who was
Chief Justice-designate, it would be wiser to defer any meetings on
that subject until I was formally in office. He agreed. And on the morn-
ing of June 24th, less than 24 hours after I took office, we met for
breakfast in his chambers with several other judges and leaders in
public administration. That was the beginning, or, rather, I should
say the beginning of an enlargement of a cooperation with Tom Clark
which I had experienced for a good many years before that in the
programs and activities that both of us felt were so crucial to the
future of the judicial system, in both federal and state courts.
From that day forward, literally to the Saturday preceding his
death when I met him in the hall of the Court, and visited on some
common problems, my communication with Tom Clark was continu-
ous. There was no problem that reached my desk on which he was not
prepared and willing to shoulder responsibilities at my request. Apart
from taking specific assignments on programs and projects of the
Center, and of the Judicial Conference, I consulted with him fre-
quently informally, at lunch in my chambers or over a cup of tea or a
discussion in his chambers.
When the matter of the selection of his successor was before us, as it
was at the time I came here, I consulted with him and followed his
recommendation as to the appointment of Judge Alfred Murrah as his
successor.
And then, once relieved of his duties as Director, in September 1969,
Tom Clark resumed the regular sittings in the Courts of Appeals, in
special courts and the District Courts that have already been referred
to. No one in the history of this Court, after retirement as an Asso-
ciate Justice, has ever engaged in such constant and steady judicial
activity, as well as continuing his missionary work.
At this Court's request, he undertook difficult assignments as a
Special Master on cases where not only his rich legal background, but
particularly his abundant common sense and his great powers of per-
suasion made it desirable to call upon him.

408
MONDAY, JANUARY 23, 1978
During the years from 1969 until his death, there was never any
occasion in which he did not respond instantly to any request we
made of him to take on special assignments, either at the Center or
sitting on other courts or as a Special Master. But, at the same time,
his sensitivity was such that he was careful not to interpose his views
on his successor, Judge Murrah, as Director of the Federal Judicial
Center.
Before I close, I would like to mention just a few personal aspects
of his temperament and personality. In the years that I was seeing
him frequently, from 1969 until last year, and our friendship had gone
back to 1953 when I first began to make appearances in this Court,
I noted one thing about him that always puzzled me. He gave the im-
pression of being an unhurried and unharried person. Yet when we
came to know him well, we learned that he was about as unhurried
as a dynamo, and he gave off the same kind of energy that a dynamo
produces. He influenced all those he worked with, and it bears repeat-
ing that no one can remember any judge or Justice of this country who
had a wider personal acquaintance with so many federal and state
judges and bar leaders as did Tom Clark. And these were warm, per-
sonal and lasting relationships, which, quite frankly, he exploited to
the fullest to carry out programs of improvement for the state and
federal courts.
A further aspect was his deep humility, even as he furnished this
dynamic and innnovative leadership. And by humility, I mean a
willingness to listen to others even while they were being persuaded,
sometimes unknown to them, by his gentle but very firm advocacy.
I recall one story told me by the wife of a judge in Minnesota on the
occasion when Tom Clark came to the city of St. Paul, my home city,
to dedicate a memorial to Roscoe Pound, who had made his famous
speech on justice, in the State Capitol in 1906.
For some reason the escort judge was late in meeting Tom-or,
more likely, Tom was early in arriving at the appointed place. The
wife of the Minnesota judge was awaiting her husband at the time,
and she told me that she approached Justice Clark with some appre-
hension and apologized for her husband's delay, and, being conscious
that there was some protocol, but not quite sure what it was, she
said, "I have never met a Justice of the Supreme Court before; how do
I address you?"
With that infectious grin that we all know so well and will never
forget, he replied immediately, "Just call me Tom."
This was not an isolated or unusual reaction from Tom Clark, for
he was known not to hundreds but literally thousands of state and
federal judges and lawyers throughout this country, and except for

MONDAY, JANUARY 23, 1978
409
some occasions where formality was imperative, I doubt that he was
ever addressed in any other way than "Just call me Tom."
So we will remember him, along with his remarkable contributions
to the improvement of justices, as a bundle of quiet energy, a dynamo
in both ideas and execution of those ideas, all of it concealed under the
appearance of a relaxed Texas cowboy.
Before I close, I must add a word as to the part Mary Clark, his wife,
played in his remarkable career. I should say remarkable careers, for
we have all said there were several-we are divided only as to whether
there were two careers or three; I have said he had three.
As with her husband, literally thousands of judges and lawyers and
law teachers in this country knew her as "Mary". Her contribution to
his life and career was very great. And, in a far lesser way, of course,
we share the loss she and her family have experienced.
I speak for all members of this Court, and I will undertake to speak
for thousands of state and federal judges and lawyers of the United
States, in this final salute to a man who has done so much to make the
judicial systems work, to make justice meet the needs of our times in all
of our courts.

ORDER IN PENDING CASE
No. A-807. Kenneth Brown et al., applicants, v. Meldrim Thomson,
Jr., Governor of New Hampshire. Application for stay of judgment of
the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (Misc. No.
78-8029), presented to Mr. Justice Brennan and by him referred to the
Court, granted pending the timely filing and disposition of a petition
for a writ of certiorari in this Court. Should the petition for a writ of
certiorari not be timely filed or denied, this stay is to terminate auto-
matically. In the event the petition for a writ of certiorari is granted,
this stay is to remain in effect pending the issuance of the judgment of
this Court.
The Chief Justice dissenting:
I would not disturb the order of the United States Court of Appeals
for the First Circuit. Moreover, the Attorney General of New Hamp-
shire having this day personally represented to the clerk of this Court
that the Proclamation of March 21, 1978, has been superseded by a new
proclamation dated March 24, 1978, filed today, the application re-
ferred to the Court appears to be moot, and I therefore dissent from
the action of the Court and would reinstate the order of the Court of
Appeals.
Mr. Justice Stewart, Mr. Justice Powell and Mr. Justice Rehnquist
dissenting:
As we would not disturb the order of the Court of Appeals of the
First Circuit, we dissent from the order of this Court.

769
Mr. Justice Blackmun, with whom Mr. Justice Rehnquist joins, dis-
senting: I feel that the decision of the United States Court of Appeals
for the Seventh Circuit is in some tension with this Court's decision, 25
years ago, in Beauharnais v. Illinois, 343 U.S. 250 (1952). Beauharnais
has never been overruled or formally limited in any way. I therefore
would grant the stay pending consideration of the applicants' peti-
tion for certiorari which has now been filed, and pending further
order of the Court.
Adjourned until Wednesday, June 14, 1978, at 10 o'clock.
