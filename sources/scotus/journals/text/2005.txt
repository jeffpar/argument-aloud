SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

   Present: Justice Stevens, Justice O’Connor, Justice Scalia, Justice
Kennedy, Justice Souter, Justice Thomas, Justice Ginsburg, and Jus-
tice Breyer.
  Justice Stevens said:
  “On behalf of the Court Mr. President, I extend to you a warm wel-
come. This special sitting of the Court is held today to receive the
Commission of the newly appointed Chief Justice of the United States,
John G. Roberts, Jr.
  “The Court will now recognize the Attorney General of the United
States, Alberto Gonzales.”
  Attorney General Gonzales said:
  “Justice Stevens, and may it please the Court. I have the Commission
which has been issued to the Honorable John G. Roberts, Jr., as Chief
Justice of the United States. The Commission has been duly signed by
the President of the United States and attested by me as The Attorney
General of the United States. I move that the Clerk read the Commis-
sion and that it be made part of the permanent record of this Court.”
  Justice Stevens said:
  “Thank you General Gonzales, your motion is granted. Mr. Clerk,
will you please read the Commission?”
  Clerk Suter said:
  “George W. Bush, President of the United States of America, to all
who shall see these presents, Greeting: Know ye; that reposing special
trust and confidence in the wisdom, uprightness, and learning of John
G. Roberts, Jr., of Maryland, I have nominated, and, by and with the
advice and consent of the Senate, do appoint him Chief Justice of the
United States, and do authorize and empower him to execute and fulfill
the duties of that office according to the Constitution and Laws of the
said United States, and to have and to hold the said office, with all the
powers, privileges and emoluments to the same of right appertaining,
unto him, the said John G. Roberts, Jr., during his good behavior.
  “In testimony whereof, I have caused these letters to be made patent
and the Seal of the Department of Justice to be hereunto affixed.
  “Done at the City of Washington, this Twenty-ninth day of Septem-
ber in the year of our Lord Two Thousand Five and of the Independ-
ence of the United States of America the Two Hundred and Thirtieth.

2                         MONDAY, OCTOBER 3, 2005

By the President: George W. Bush. Alberto Gonzales, Attorney
General.”
  Justice Stevens said:
  “I now ask the Deputy Clerk of the Court to escort Judge Roberts
to the Bench.”
    Justice Stevens said:
    “Are you ready to take the oath?”
    Judge Roberts said:
    “I am.”
  Justice Stevens said:
  “Will you repeat after me?
  “I, John G. Roberts, Jr., do solemnly swear that I will administer
justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor and
to the rich, and that I will faithfully and impartially discharge and
perform all the duties incumbent upon me as The Chief Justice of the
United States under the Constitution and Laws of the United States,
so help me God.”
   Justice Stevens said:
   “Chief Justice Roberts, on behalf of all the members of the Court, it
is a pleasure to extend to you a very warm welcome as the Seventeenth
Chief Justice of the United States and to wish you a long and happy
career in our common calling.”


    Adjourned until 10:30 this morning.

  Present: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Stevens, Justice O’Connor,
Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, Justice Souter, Justice Thomas, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer.
  Justice Stevens said:
  “For thirty days our flags have flown at half-mast as a gesture of
respect for our friend and colleague, William Hubbs Rehnquist, the
former Chief Justice of the United States, who died on September 3,
2005 at his home in Arlington, Virginia.
  “Born in Milwaukee in 1924, Bill Rehnquist was the son of William
Benjamin and Margery Peck Rehnquist. He attended public elemen-
tary and high schools in Shorewood, Wisconsin, a suburb of Milwaukee.
During the Second World War he served in the Army Air Force as a
weather observer in the United States and North Africa. He was hon-
orably discharged in April of 1946.

   “He was graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Stanford University with
a B.A. and M.A. in 1948 and also received an M.A. from Harvard Uni-
versity in 1950. He earned his law degree from Stanford University in
1952, where he was first in his class.
   “After leaving Stanford, the Chief Justice was a law clerk to Su-
preme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson from February 1952 through
June 1953. He practiced law in Phoenix, Arizona, from 1953 to 1969
when President Nixon appointed him Assistant Attorney General, Of-
fice of Legal Counsel. He was nominated as an Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court of the United States by President Nixon on October
21, 1971 and sworn in on January 7, 1972. Some fourteen years later
President Reagan nominated him Chief Justice of the United States
and he was sworn in on September 26, 1986. Chief Justice Rehnquist
was the longest serving Chief Justice since Chief Justice Melville Ful-
ler, who died in office in 1910.
   “While on the bench, Chief Justice Rehnquist authored 458 opinions
for the Court, 376 dissenting opinions, and over 100 separate writings
either concurring in part and dissenting in part or explaining his rul-
ings as a circuit justice. These opinions were lucid expositions of the
law, often revealing his exceptional familiarity with the history of our
country. Moreover many of them, as well as the books that he authored,
provided evidence of his profound love for our country and our inde-
pendent judicial system. He was truly the first among equals, having
led us by examples of excellence rather than by fiat. Although his opin-
ions have shaped every important area of the Court’s jurisprudence,
with his background as a practicing lawyer he realized that it was often
the opinions issued with little fanfare that would have the greatest
impact on the day-to-day practice of law. He sometimes described these
opinions by quoting from Thomas Gray’s Elegy Written in a Country
Churchyard: ‘Full many a flower is born to blush unseen, And waste
its sweetness on the desert air.’
   “The members of this Court will greatly miss Chief Justice Rehn-
quist’s warmth and collegiality. I speak for all of us in expressing our
sympathy to his son, Jim, his daughters, Janet and Nancy, his grand-
children, and to all those whose lives were touched by this remarkable
man. At an appropriate time, the traditional memorial observance of
the Court and the Bar of the Court will be held in this Courtroom.
   “We now turn to the future. Tomorrow our flags will no longer fly at
half-mast. Today we welcome our new Chief Justice, John G.
Roberts, Jr., and we express our thanks to President Bush and to the
members of the United States Senate for the wisdom and diligence
that attended the process of nominating and confirming Chief Justice

Roberts in time to enable him to preside over our proceedings today.
It is appropriate to note that in his pre-judicial career our new Chief
Justice argued 39 times before this Court, a number that exceeds the
combined experience of the rest of us. We know him well and he has
already earned our respect and admiration.”
   The Chief Justice said:
   “Thank you very much Justice Stevens.”
   “I have the honor to announce, on behalf of the Court, that the Octo-
ber 2004 Term of the Supreme Court of the United States is now
closed, and the October 2005 Term is now convened.
   “Today’s orders of the Court have been duly entered and certified,
and filed with the Clerk, and they will not be otherwise announced.
   “I would like to welcome the Members of a British Delegation who
are visiting our Court today as participants in the Anglo-American
Legal Exchange.”

                       Order in Pending Case
   No. 05A578. C. T. Hanft, United States Navy Commander, Consoli-
dated Naval Brig, Applicant v. Jose Padilla. Jose Padilla has filed a
petition for certiorari, seeking review of the Fourth Circuit’s judgment
upholding his detention by military authorities. See Padilla v. Hanft,
No. 05–533 (filed Oct. 25, 2005). On November 22, 2005, the Government
filed a motion before the Fourth Circuit, seeking approval to transfer
Padilla from military custody to the custody of the warden of a federal
detention center in Florida, to face criminal charges contained in an
indictment filed November 17, 2005. See Supreme Court Rule 36.1
(“Pending review in this Court of a decision in a habeas corpus
proceeding. . . the person having custody of the prisoner may not trans-
fer custody to another person unless the transfer is authorized under
this Rule.”). Padilla agreed that the transfer should be approved. The
Fourth Circuit denied the request, citing a concern that transfer might
affect this Court’s consideration of the pending petition for certiorari
and concluding that the “decision should be made not by this court but,
rather, by the Supreme Court of the United States.” Order at 3, Padi-
lla v. Hanft, No. 05–6396 (CA4 Dec. 21, 2005). The Solicitor General
has now filed with this Court an Application Respecting the Custody
and Transfer of Jose Padilla, seeking the same authorization previously
sought from the Court of Appeals. Padilla has filed a response, arguing
instead that the Court should delay his release from military custody
and consider his release along with his petition for certiorari. The Gov-
ernment’s application presented to The Chief Justice and by him re-
ferred to the Court is granted. The Court will consider the pending
petition for certiorari in due course.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

  Present: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Stevens, Justice O’Connor,
Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, Justice Souter, Justice Thomas, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer.

                          Certiorari Denied
   No. 05–8639 (05A639). Clarence R. Allen, Petitioner v. Steven W.
Ornoski, Acting Warden. Application for stay of execution of sentence
of death presented to Justice O’Connor and by her referred to the
Court denied. Petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of
California denied. Justice Breyer dissenting.
   Petitioner is 76 years old, blind, suffers from diabetes, is confined to
a wheelchair, and has been on death row for 23 years. I believe that in
the circumstances he raises a significant question as to whether his
execution would constitute “cruel and unusual punishment.” U. S. Con-
stitution Amendment 8. See Knight v. Florida, 528 U. S. 990, 993 (1999)
(Breyer, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari); Elledge v. Florida,
525 U. S. 944 (1998) (Breyer, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari);
Lackey v. Texas, 514 U. S. 1045 (1995) (Stevens, J., respecting denial of
certiorari). I would grant the application for stay of execution.

                          Certiorari Denied

  The Chief Justice said:
  “Before calling the first case, I would like to acknowledge the pres-
ence in the Courtroom this morning of Justice Sandra Day O’Connor,
and I would like to read into the records of the Court an exchange of
correspondence. The first letter is dated January 31, 2006, the effective
date of Justice O’Connor’s retirement. It is to her from me and it reads
as follows:
  “Dear Sandra, I am honored to transmit to you the letter that the
members of the Court with whom you sat for so many years signed
shortly after you announced your retirement last summer. After serv-
ing with you for only a few months, I understand how sincere and
heartfelt their sentiments are. I join them wholeheartedly, with added
appreciation for your invaluable guidance and support over the past
several months. Sincerely, John.”
 The Chief Justice said:
 “I would like now to invite Justice Stevens to read the letter that
was signed last summer.”
  Justice Stevens said:
  “This letter is dated July 18, 2005, and it was written by William H.
Rehnquist, and signed by all of Justice O’Connor’s then colleagues.
  “Dear Sandra, your decision to retire brings a sense of loss to each
of us. When you came to the Court twenty-four years ago, you faced
the same challenges that new members of the institution have always
faced. But, in addition you faced a challenge that none of them faced—
you were the first woman justice. You have met all of these challenges
with ability and élan.
  “Your opinions have left their mark on every major field of the
Court’s jurisprudence. You have also lent your hand to numerous
extra-judicial activities—the ABA’s CEELI program, for example, and
the Court’s Renovation Committee. We have all profited from your

contributions during our twelve years together, and will miss you
greatly. Affectionately, and we all signed the letter.”
  The Chief Justice said:
  “The final letter is dated today, March 27th, and it reads:
  “Dear Colleagues, thank you for the kind letter each of you signed
on the occasion of my retirement. I look back on my twenty-four plus
years here with warm appreciation for all the goodwill each of you has
shown to me despite the occasionally contentious nature of our work.
I can truly say our nation is blessed by having a Supreme Court with
such gifted, intelligent, and hardworking members. The process fol-
lowed here works remarkably well. I will always cherish the opportu-
nity to have served on the Court with each of you. Sincerely, signed

1080                     THURSDAY, JUNE 15, 2006

The Chief Justice said:
   “The Court is in special session this afternoon to receive the Resolu-
tions of the Bar of the Supreme Court in tribute to Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist. The Court recognizes the Solicitor General.”
  The Solicitor General said:
  “Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. At a meeting today
of the Bar of this Court, Resolutions memorializing our deep respect
and affection for Chief Justice Rehnquist were unanimously adopted.
Today, the members of the Bar of the Supreme Court honor the life
and legacy of a gifted lawyer. A selfless public servant, and a treasured
teacher, mentor, and friend. Those who knew William Rehnquist will
remember him as one, who in the words of Justice Holmes ‘lived
greatly in the law’.” “To his credit however, he cared less about being
great, than about doing and living well. As President George W. Bush
remarked, ‘to work beside William Rehnquist was to learn how a wise
man looks at the law and how a good man looks at life.’ ”
  “Rehnquist was born in Wisconsin, on October 1, 1924, the son of a
paper salesman and a homemaker who spoke five languages and
worked as a translator. He was raised in Shorewood, a Milwaukee sub-
urb near Lake Michigan, and graduated from high school in 1942.
Shortly thereafter, he joined the United States Army Air Corps. His
war-time service took him to a number of domestic posts, and also to
more exotic destinations in North Africa. His time there impressed
upon him that “if you lived in the right place, you didn’t have to shovel
snow for four months a year.” Accordingly, after discharging from the
service as a sergeant, he headed west to Stanford University in 1946.
  “After graduating from Stanford and completing a year of graduate
study at Harvard, Rehnquist returned to Stanford, where he flourished
at the law school. Upon graduation, he served as a law clerk for Justice
Robert Jackson. Rehnquist later described his clerkship as ‘one of the
most rewarding experiences of my life.’ ”
  “Rehnquist’s time in Washington proved doubly rewarding, for dur-
ing this period he began dating Natalie “Nan” Cornell, whom he mar-
ried in August 1953. Characteristically unconventional, Rehnquist
passed up opportunities at lucrative East Coast law firms, and chose
Phoenix. During his 16 years of private practice there, Rehnquist rep-
resented a broad array of clients. He was also active in politics and
civic life. Through it all, he maintained a balanced life. He would work
from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., then close the law books, and go home. He
and Nan were blessed with three children—Jim, Janet, and Nancy—

and the Rehnquist family managed to take a month’s vacation together
each year.
   “After the 1968 presidential election, Rehnquist was nominated and
confirmed as Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Coun-
sel. Rehnquist discharged his responsibilities with such great distinc-
tion that, when Justice John Marshall Harlan retired in 1971, Rehnquist
was the President’s choice to be the 100th Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court of the United States. Confirmed in 1972 at age 47,
Rehnquist was one of the youngest Justices in modern history. As an
Associate Justice, he emerged as a powerful intellectual force. He au-
thored a number of significant opinions for the Court, but he did not
hesitate to express his position in solitary dissent, thus inspiring an
early group of law clerks to bestow upon him a Lone Ranger doll as a
mantlepiece. When Chief Justice Warren Burger resigned in 1986, it
was precisely Rehnquist’s powerful intellect, his stellar record on the
Court, and his consistent judicial philosophy that made him President
Ronald Reagan’s pick to lead the Court.
   “As Rehnquist took his new seat as the leader of the Court in 1986,
President Reagan presciently remarked that he ‘will be a Chief Justice
of historic stature.’ ” Rehnquist’s jurisprudential legacy was substan-
tial, especially in areas of criminal procedure, religious liberty and due
process. His influence was, however, perhaps most evident in the
Court’s cases involving federalism. As early as 1975, he made clear his
position on regulating the “States as States” under the commerce
clause power. Dissenting alone, Rehnquist argued that the federal gov-
ernment must treat the States like sovereign entities, rather than indi-
viduals. As happened a number of times during his tenure, Rehnquist’s
position in dissent ultimately was embraced by a majority of the Court.
Rehnquist’s promotion of federalism ultimately served as the basis for
the Court’s anti-commandeering principle, its strengthening of the
States’ sovereign immunity, and its reaffirmance of “judicially enforce-
able outer limits” on the commerce power, in United States v. Lopez.
   “Rehnquist’s legacy on the Supreme Court involves much more than
doctrinal contributions and noteworthy decisions. He encouraged and
exemplified collegiality, fairness, and graciousness among the Justices.
Of course, for those attorneys privileged enough to argue before the
Supreme Court during his long tenure, his legacy is as much about his
commanding presence on the Bench as his approach to the Constitution
or the Conference. Rehnquist’s view of oral argument was emblematic
of his no-nonsense approach to judging and to life. Rehnquist preferred
plain-spoken arguments to flowery rhetoric. And although he was a
JNL05$0615—07-10-06 13:31:51     JOURNAPGT         MILES




1082                     THURSDAY, JUNE 15, 2006

kind and easygoing man, he adopted a stern and no-nonsense demeanor
on the Bench, running arguments with Nordic precision, and always
with the utmost respect for the red light.
   “Above and beyond his demanding official duties, Rehnquist pursued
and cultivated a rich array of interests and passions. Family, friends,
and law clerks remember well his dedication to afternoon swims and
weekly tennis matches, his friendly wagering on football, his love of
trivia and charades, and his interest in—and voluminous knowledge
of—sports, literature, geography, and art. Rehnquist also served as
Historian-in-Chief, writing numerous books on history, which also fore-
shadowed the next chapters in our Nation’s history.
   “William Rehnquist served well his country, his profession, and the
Constitution. All the while, he embraced the value, interest, and impor-
tance of ordinary, everyday life. He took to heart Dr. Johnson’s dictum
that ‘[t]o be happy at home is the end of all human endeavor.’ ” He
exhorted law school graduates to realize that their abilities and oppor-
tunities gave them “choices,” and that “how wisely you make these
choices will determine how well spent you think your life is when you
look back at it.” Gathered here together, looking back at his life, the
Members of the Bar of the Supreme Court are pleased and honored
to announce the opinion–and, no doubt, the Chief is pleased that it is
unanimous–that his was a great life, exceedingly well spent.
   “On behalf of the Bar of the Supreme Court, it is my privilege to
present to the Court the Resolutions adopted today so that the Deputy
Attorney General may move their inscription on the Court’s perma-
nent record.”
   The Chief Justice said:
   “Thank you General Clement. I now recognize the Deputy Attorney
General of the United States.”
   Mr. McNulty said:
   “Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court. On behalf of the
Attorney General, I am pleased to say that the Bar of the Court met
today to honor the memory of William H. Rehnquist, Associate Justice
of the Supreme Court from 1971 to 1986, and Chief Justice of the
United States from 1986 to 2005.
   “William Rehnquist served his country with great honor and distinc-
tion. He was a patriot who deeply appreciated the virtues and founda-
tions of our constitutional government. He had a giant intellect, but
lacked all pretense and was known for his collegiality and sense of
humor. And during his 33 years on this Court, he made a profound
contribution to the American rule of law. When he was only a child,

                         THURSDAY, JUNE 15, 2006                   1083
William Rehnquist told his elementary school teacher that he was
‘going to change the government.’ Not long thereafter, he embarked
on a path of public service and accomplishment that would lead him to
fulfill that prediction.
   “His journey of public service began when he joined the Army as a
teenager to serve his country during World War II. He served as a law
clerk to one of the legendary figures in American law, Justice Robert
Jackson. And he later served as an Assistant Attorney General in the
Nixon Administration. At the Department of Justice, it has been said
that he converted what was then a little known post—the Office of
Legal Counsel—into “one of the key positions of the Administration.”
He also successfully argued a case before this Court, after which, he
remarked, he ‘was drenched with sweat.’ ” But that was just a
beginning.
   “In 1971, Rehnquist, only in his 40s, was appointed to this Court. He
immediately became known for his fierce intellect, lone dissents, and
conservative jurisprudence. He also impressed his new colleagues with
his affable, down-to-earth Midwestern demeanor, if not his trademark
sideburns and thick-rimmed glasses.
   “When Chief Justice Burger retired in 1986, President Reagan saw
in Rehnquist the measure of a great chief justice. As President Reagan
explained, “Rehnquist had distinguished himself ‘for his intellectual
power, the lucidity of his opinions, and the respect he enjoys among
his colleagues.’ ” When asked about his nomination to be chief justice,
Rehnquist—flashing his characteristic wit and self-deprecation—re-
plied, ‘I wouldn’t call it the culmination of a dream, but it’s not every
day when you’re 61 years old that you get a chance to have a new job.’ ”
   “Chief Justice Rehnquist had a profound impact on the Court and
our legal system. He authored close to 1000 opinions, presided over
almost as many oral arguments, and administered the oath of office on
five occasions to three different Presidents. He was only the second
chief justice to preside over impeachment proceedings against a sitting
president. He managed the Court with unrivaled efficiency, and he was
uniformly praised by his colleagues for his fairness, impartiality, good
humor, and selfless leadership on his watch. Chief Justice Rehnquist
held the public decorum of the Court in the highest regard and had a
powerful presence at the center of the Bench. He presided over per-
haps the most active Bench in the history of this Court. As a result,
during oral argument he often assumed the role of “master sergeant”—
a role accented by the gold stripes he wore on his robe in later years.
He made virtually immeasurable contributions to American constitu-

1084                     THURSDAY, JUNE 15, 2006

tional law. He was a key participant in the Court’s decisions placing
limits on the Miranda rule, recognizing greater leeway for the police
in conducting searches under the Fourth Amendment, and in enforcing
the limits on federal habeas corpus review of state court criminal con-
victions. His respect for the role of the States in our constitutional
government sparked a revitalization of the doctrine of federalism.
   “In 1975, Rehnquist wrote in dissent that ‘[s]urely there can be no
more fundamental constitutional question than that of the intention of
the Framers of the Constitution as to how authority should be allocated
between the National and State Governments.’ ”
   “In time, his dissenting views on the role of federalism and the enu-
merated limits on federal legislative power secured a majority on the
Court in a number of important cases, including the Court’s landmark
decision in United States v. Lopez.
   “Chief Justice Rehnquist believed strongly in the virtues of judicial
restraint. He cautioned that permitting “non-elected members of the
federal judiciary” to resolve divisive social issues that were not ad-
dressed by the Constitution was “genuinely corrosive for the funda-
mental values of our democratic society.” He invoked such principles
in his opinion for the Court in Washington v. Glucksberg, in which the
Court refused to invoke the Due Process Clause as a means of invali-
dating a State’s assisted-suicide ban.
   “As an Associate Justice, Rehnquist wrote passionately in dissent
that the Court’s church-state jurisprudence had broken free from its
constitutional and historic moorings.
   “As Chief Justice, he led the Court in a number of important Estab-
lishment Clause cases, including the Court’s landmark decision four
Terms ago upholding Cleveland’s student voucher program. Chief Jus-
tice Rehnquist was an ardent advocate on behalf of the federal judi-
ciary and a champion of the independent judiciary. In his annual re-
ports on the state of the federal judiciary, he addressed head-on and
without pretense or partisanship the major issues confronting the judi-
ciary each year. And in his nineteenth, and final, year-end report, he
wrote that it is ‘judicial independence that has made our judicial sys-
tem a model for much of the world.’ ”
   “Chief Justice Rehnquist was too modest to speak about his own
place in history, but he once observed his own insights as to what made
John Marshall such a great chief justice. He explained that Marshall
‘had a remarkable ability to reason from general principles’; ‘he was
able to write clearly and cogently’; and, ‘every bit as important,’ he
‘was very well liked.’ ”

                          THURSDAY, JUNE 15, 2006                   1085
   “William Rehnquist shared those same qualities with Marshall. He
had a brilliant analytic mind and encyclopedic knowledge of the law.
As he proved in his legendary “lone ranger” dissents, he was a power-
ful and lucid writer. And “every bit as important,” he was a beloved
man who earned the trust, confidence, and deep admiration of his
colleagues.
   “Chief Justice Rehnquist was a stalwart of the federal judiciary and
faithful guardian of our Constitution. Few Americans have contributed
more to this Court, or their country, in the cause of justice and the rule
of law. He deserves his place alongside the nation’s great chief justices.
And the country owes him an enormous debt of gratitude for a life of
devoted public service.
   “Mr. Chief Justice, and on behalf of the Attorney General, the law-
yers of this Nation, and, in particular, the Bar of this Court,
I respectfully request, that the Resolutions presented to you in honor
of the memory of Chief Justice William Rehnquist be accepted by the
Court, and that they, together with the chronicle of these proceedings,
be ordered kept for all time in the records of this Court.”
   The Chief Justice said:
   “Thank you Mr. McNulty and General Clement for your presenta-
tions. Your motion that the Bar Resolutions be made part of the perma-
nent records of the Court is granted.
   “We also extend to Chairman Steven Colloton and members of the
Committee on Resolutions; Chairman John Nannes and members of the
Arrangements Committee; and Ronald Tenpas, Chairman of today’s
meeting of the Bar, our appreciation for the Resolutions you have
adopted today.
   The Chief Justice said:
   “William H. Rehnquist was nominated to the Supreme Court by
President Nixon on October 21, 1971, and joined the Court as its 100th
member on January 7, 1972.
   “In 1986, President Reagan nominated him as our nation’s sixteenth
Chief Justice, and he took the oath for that office on September 26,
1986. In his nearly 34 years on the Court, Chief Justice Rehnquist
wrote 458 opinions for the Court–beginning with Schneble v. Florida
in 1972 and ending with Van Orden v. Perry in 2005. He served with
sixteen other Justices.
   “You have heard described the Chief ’s legacy in specific areas of the
law, such as criminal procedure, federalism, state immunity, and free-
dom of religion, but perhaps his most significant contribution was
broader than any particular area of the law.

1086                     THURSDAY, JUNE 15, 2006

   “Over his years on this bench, Chief Justice Rehnquist helped bring
a sharper focus to the work of the Court. This manifested itself in many
ways. During oral arguments he would maintain focus on the precise
question upon which the Court had granted certiorari—often to the
frustration of arguing counsel. An assertion by a lawyer about what a
statute meant was likely to be met by a question from the Chief about
what it said. Perhaps his trademark question from the bench, regularly
asked whenever a lawyer propounded a broad assertion on a point of
law, was “Which one of our cases supports for that proposition?”
   “What was remarkable was the Chief ’s ability to distinguish on-the-
spot any offered citation that the Chief thought was not on point.
   “The Chief brought the same rigor he expected of counsel to his own
work. His opinions are notable for being clear and concise. They gener-
ally exhibit a spareness that the Chief thought was beneficial not only
to lower courts and lawyers bound to apply them, but also to proper
development of the law. There were exceptions to this rule—an opinion
on an obscure Postal Service regulation might contain a fascinating
sidebar on the history of the Pony Express, the minutiae of a water-
rights opinion might be broken up by a disquisition on the first irriga-
tion project in the arid west. That was just the Chief ’s love of history
and a good story coming through, and the readers of his opinions were
richer for it.
   “The Chief ’s colleagues on the bench have spoken often of their high
regard and genuine affection for him, and they have commented on the
fairness with which he administered the Court. From the time he hung
out a shingle in Phoenix for a two-person firm in which his partner
was the head of the Young Democrats, William Rehnquist never al-
lowed differing views on even fundamental issues to prevent him from
enjoying warm and close friendships with people from all walks of life.
   “You heard the Chief Justice described in the Bar meeting as a great
lawyer, mentor, teacher, colleague, and friend. But there is no doubt
he was first and foremost a loving husband to Nan and dedicated father
to his children Jim, Janet, and Nancy. He managed to make it home for
dinner almost every evening, and to take a month’s vacation with his
family each summer. He knew what was important in life.
   “Chief Justice Rehnquist was an accomplished historian who wrote
four books. He could quote poetry for any occasion. Name just about
any city in the world, he could likely tell you its population and
weather, and probably the nearest body of water and mountain range.
He enjoyed card and board games, a trivia and charades expert, and

he was the only person I have ever witnessed lie down on his stomach
to line up a shot at croquet.
  “He was a patriot who loved and served his country. More than any-
one I’ve known, he trusted in himself. He was direct and straightfor-
ward; utterly without pretense and completely unaffected in manner.
  “Ralph Waldo Emerson’s 1841 essay “Self-Reliance,” contains a line
that the Chief liked: “Trust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron
string.” There’s another passage in that same essay that the Chief liked
that I think aptly describes his approach to the law and to life. These
are Emerson’s words:
   “What I must do is all that concerns me, not what the people
   think. This rule, equally arduous in actual and in intellectual life,
   may serve for the whole distinction between greatness and mean-
   ness. It is the harder because you will always find those who
   think they know what is your duty better than you know it. It is
   easy in the world to live after the world’s opinion; it is easy in
   solitude to live after our own; but the great man is he who in the
   midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independ-
   ence of solitude.”
  “We pay tribute today to a great man. He will be missed by his
colleagues, his friends, family, and all those whose lives he touched.”

their hard work, professionalism, and dedication to duty over the past

Administrative Assistant to the Chief Justice. After six years of service
in that position, Ms. Rider will be leaving us, before we reconvene in
the fall, to become the director of the William H. Rehnquist Center
on the Constitutional Structures of Government at the University of
Arizona. That is the only reason we are letting her go. Thank you,
Sally, for your outstanding service.
  “The superb work done by all members of the Court staff contributes
significantly to the accomplishment of the Court’s mission.”
