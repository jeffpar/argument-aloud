occurred on September 11th. I know our hearts go out to the families
of those killed and injured. We extend our condolences to the Solicitor
General of the United States for the loss of his wife Barbara.
   “In the aftermath of the attacks, we have witnessed extraordinary
bravery and compassion from Americans from all walks of life. Let us
take a moment to grieve with those who mourn, and honor those who
have historically performed their duty.’
   “Today’s orders of the Court have been certified by The Chief Jus-
tice, filed with the Clerk, and they will not be otherwise announced.”

rections, Petitioner v. Robert Douglas Smith. On petition for writ of

Motion of respondent for leave to proceed in forma pauperis granted.
Motion of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation for leave to file a
brief as amicus curiae granted. Petition for writ of certiorari granted.
Question certified to the Supreme Court of Arizona. Judgment and
further proceedings in this case reserved pending receipt of a response
from the Supreme Court of Arizona. Opinion per curiam.


                     Orders in Pending Cases
  No. 00–1531. Verizon Maryland Inc., Petitioner v. Public Service
Commission of Maryland, et al.; and
  No. 00–1711. United States, Petitioner v. Public Service Commission
of Maryland, et al. Petitions for certiorari in these cases presented
the same questions at issue in Mathias v. WorldCom Technologies,
No. 00–878, plus the additional question of subject matter jurisdiction
under 28 U. S. C. § 1331. We granted certiorari only on the additional
question, and held the other questions pending their resolution in Ma-
thias, supra. Oral argument has revealed, however, that we may be
unable to reach the merits of the questions presented in Mathias.
Therefore, to ensure that we have jurisdiction over all of the questions
at issue in these cases, petitions for writs of certiorari to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit granted on the remain-
ing questions presented by the petitions, and request that the parties
brief those questions. Briefs of petitioners to be filed with the Clerk
and served upon opposing counsel on or before 3 p.m., Friday, January
11, 2002. Respondents’ briefs to be filed with the Clerk and served
upon opposing counsel on or before 3 p.m., Friday, February 1, 2002.
Reply briefs, if any, to be filed with the Clerk and served upon opposing
counsel on or before 3 p.m., Friday, February 15, 2002. Petitioners’

ation or decision of this order.

share the honor.
  “On behalf of all of your colleagues, I want to express our sincere
appreciation for the exemplary way in which you have performed the
special responsibilities of your high office, with particular emphasis
on the efficiency, good humor, and absolute impartiality that you have
consistently displayed when presiding at our Conferences.
  “In a different setting, I would propose a toast to you, but, here I
shall merely express our thanks for your 30 years of dedicated service
to our Country.”
  The Chief Justice said:
  “Thank you, Justice Stevens. Today’s orders of the Court have been
certified by The Chief Justice, filed with the Clerk, and they will not

(JOURNAL)                 TUESDAY, APRIL 16, 2002                    777
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

   Present: Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice Stevens, Justice O’Connor,
Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, Justice Souter, Justice Thomas, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer.
   The Chief Justice said:
   “As we open this morning, I want to pay tribute to our friend and
colleague Byron R. White, a retired Justice of this Court, who died
yesterday morning in Colorado.
   “Byron White was nominated to the Court by President Kennedy on
April 3, 1962, and was confirmed by the Senate eight days later. He
took the oath of office forty years ago today, on April 16, 1962. He was
the 93rd Justice to serve on this Court.
   “Justice White was born and raised in Colorado. He was a rare com-
bination of brilliant scholar and gifted athlete. He attended the Univer-
sity of Colorado, earning ten varsity letters, winning a Rhodes scholar-
ship to Oxford. Before attending Oxford, he played professional
football for the old Pittsburgh Pirates. When he returned from Oxford,
he attended Yale Law School while playing football for the Detroit
Lions on the weekends. He served as an intelligence officer for the
Navy during World War II.
   “Justice White was graduated from Yale Law School, earning the
Cullen Prize for high academic grades. He clerked for Chief Justice
Vinson and then returned home to Colorado where he practiced law
for fourteen years, before joining the Justice Department as deputy
attorney general under Robert Kennedy. Less than a year later, Presi-
dent Kennedy named him to the Court.
   “Justice White was an able colleague and a good friend. He came as
close as any to meriting Matthew Arnold’s description of Sophocles: he
‘saw life steadily and he saw it whole.’ All of us who served with him
feel a sense of personal loss. Our condolences go out to his wife, Marion,
his two children, and their families.
   “At an appropriate time in the fall, the traditional memorial observ-
ance of the Court and the Bar will be held in this Courtroom.”
                                Opinion
   No. 00–795. John D. Ashcroft, Attorney General, et al., Petitioners
v. The Free Speech Coalition, et al. On writ of certiorari to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Judgment affirmed.
