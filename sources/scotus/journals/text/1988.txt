adjourned and the October 1989 Term of the Court will begin as pro-
vided by statute on the first Monday in October.
Because of certain fiscal constraints, this has been a particularly try-
ing Term for the entire Supreme Court staff-the housekeeping staff
and security forces, those who process the thousands of documents sub-
mitted for consideration, those who assist in our research and respond
to our myriad queries, those who assemble and publish our final prod-
uct. I speak for all of the members of the Court in thanking all of the
Supreme Court staff for his and her continued dedicated work during
the Term."
