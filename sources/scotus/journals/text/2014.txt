  No. 137, Original. State of Montana, Plaintiff v. State of Wyoming
and State of North Dakota. Report of the Special Master received and
ordered ﬁled. The Court notes that the Master has twice directed the
parties to address whether the amount of damages at stake justiﬁes
further proceedings. The Master’s Report and submissions of parties
indicate that fees and expenses could well exceed any recovery. Parties
are therefore directed to consider carefully whether it is appropriate
for them to continue invoking the jurisdiction of this Court. See Ari­
zona v. California, 373 U. S. 546, 564 (1963) (“[W]e are mindful of this
Court’s often expressed preference that, where possible, States settle
their controversies by mutual accommodation and agreement.” (inter­
nal quotation marks omitted)). The Special Master is encouraged to
facilitate efforts to resolve the parties’ dispute without need for a dam­
ages proceeding, including by revisiting the arrangement for division
of fees and expenses. Cf. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 68. If parties elect to
continue, exceptions to the Report, with supporting briefs, may be ﬁled
within 45 days. Replies, if any, with supporting briefs, may be ﬁled
within 30 days. Sur-replies, if any, with supporting briefs, may be ﬁled
within 30 days. Motion of Special Master for allowance of fees and
disbursements granted, and the Special Master is awarded a total of
$201,104.90 for the period July 2, 2013, through April 30, 2014, to be
paid equally by Montana and Wyoming.

plication for a stay presented to Justice Scalia and by him referred to
the Court granted, and issuance of the mandate of the United States
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in case No. 14-50928 stayed
pending the timely ﬁling and disposition of a petition for writ of certio­
rari. Should the petition for writ of certiorari be denied, this stay shall
terminate automatically. In the event the petition for writ of certiorari
is granted, the stay shall terminate upon issuance of the judgment of
this Court. The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, Justice Thomas, and Jus­
tice Alito would deny the application for stay.



                       Order in Pending Case
  No. 14A1065. David A. Zubik, et al., Applicants v. Sylvia Burwell,
Secretary of Health and Human Services, et al. Application for order
recalling and staying issuance of the mandate pending the ﬁling and
disposition of a petition for writ of certiorari having been submitted to
Justice Alito and by him referred to the Court denied. The application

ensure that the Secretary of Health and Human Services is in posses­
sion of all information necessary to verify applicants’ eligibility under
26 CFR § 54.9815-2713A(a) or 29 CFR § 2590.715-2713A(a) or 45 CFR

§ 147.131(b) (as applicable), respondents are enjoined from enforcing
against the applicants challenged provisions of the Patient Protection
and Affordable Care Act and related regulations pending ﬁnal disposi­
tion of their petition for writ of certiorari. Nothing in this interim
order affects the ability of applicants’ or their organizations’ employees
to obtain, without cost, the full range of FDA approved contraceptives.
Nor does this order preclude the Government from relying on informa­
tion provided by applicants, to the extent it considers it necessary, to
facilitate the provision of full contraceptive coverage under the Act.
See Wheaton College v. Burwell, 573 U. S. ––– (2014). This order should
not be construed as an expression of the Court’s views on the merits.
Ibid. Justice Sotomayor would deny the application.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

  Present: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy,
Justice Thomas, Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, Justice Alito, Justice
Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan.

                Certiorari—Summary Dispositions
     No. 14–460. John Hickenlooper, Governor of Colorado, Petitioner
v. Andy Kerr, et al. On petition for writ of certiorari to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. Petition for writ of cer­
tiorari granted. Judgment vacated, and case remanded to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit for further consideration
in light of Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redis­
tricting Comm’n, 576 U. S. ––– (2015).
   No. 14–8768. Sol Sebastian Peoples, Petitioner v. United States. On
petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals
for the Fifth Circuit. Motion of petitioner for leave to proceed in forma
pauperis and petition for writ of certiorari granted. Judgment vacated,
and case remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit for further consideration in light of Johnson v. United States,
576 U. S. ––– (2015).
   No. 14–9487. Christopher Michael Hornyak, Petitioner v. United
States. On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of
Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Motion of petitioner for leave to proceed
in forma pauperis and petition for writ of certiorari granted. Judg­
ment vacated, and case remanded to the United States Court of Ap­
peals for the Fifth Circuit for further consideration in light of Johnson
v. United States, 576 U. S. ––– (2015).
   No. 13–8407. Wendell Terrell Brown, Petitioner v. United States.
On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals
for the Eighth Circuit. Motion of petitioner for leave to proceed
in forma pauperis and petition for writ of certiorari granted. Judg­
ment vacated, and case remanded to the United States Court of Ap­
peals for the Eighth Circuit for further consideration in light of John­
son v. United States, 576 U. S. ––– (2015). Justice Alito concurring in
the decision to grant, vacate, and remand in this case: Following the
recommendation of the Solicitor General, the Court has held the peti­
tion in this and many other cases pending the decision in Johnson v.
United States, 576 U. S. ––– (2015). In holding this petition and now in
946                       TUESDAY, JUNE 30, 2015

vacating and remanding the decision below in this case, the Court has
not differentiated between cases in which the petitioner would be enti­
tled to relief if the Court held (as it now has) that the residual clause
of the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984, 18 U. S. C. Sec.
924(e)(2)(B)(ii), is void for vagueness and cases in which relief would
not be warranted for a procedural reason. On remand, the Court of
Appeals should understand that the Court’s disposition of this petition
does not reﬂect any view regarding petitioner’s entitlement to relief.
