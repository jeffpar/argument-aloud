MONDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1965
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
1
Present: Mr. Chief Justice Warren, Mr. Justice Black, Mr. Justice
Douglas, Mr. Justice Clark, Mr. Justice Harlan, Mr. Justice Brennan,
Mr. Justice Stewart, Mr. Justice White, and Mr. Justice Fortas.
The Chief Justice said:
"With the concurrence of my colleagues, I announce the resignation
of Mr. Justice Goldberg who resigned as an Associate Justice of this
Court since we last met to become the United States Representative
to the United Nations.
"Justice Goldberg is a native of Chicago, Illinois. He attended the
public schools of that city and Northwestern University where he
graduated from the Law School with highest honors.
"With the exception of the time he served with distinction in the
Armed Forces during World War II, he practiced law for over thirty
years in Chicago and in Washington, D.C. During all of that time he
pursued good causes and without regard as to whether they were
popular or not.
"In 1961, he was appointed Secretary of Labor by the late lamented
President John F. Kennedy, and served in that capacity until October
1, 1962, when he was appointed an Associate Justice of this Court.
His service here was brief but distinguished, and he has left an indelible
mark on our jurisprudence.
"The Court would make this announcement with deep regret except
for the fact that Justice Goldberg has accepted another post of duty
in our Government which he in conscience felt he could not decline.
We wish him every happiness and success in his new position.
"Our appreciation of our association with Justice Goldberg and for
his fine service to the Court is amplified in a letter to him which,
together with his letter to the members of the Court, will be spread
upon the Minutes of the Court."

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
WASHINGTON, D.C., 20543
CHAMBERS OF
JUSTICE ARTHUR J. GOLDBERG
July 26, 1965

MY DEAR BRETHREN:
It is with the deepest of regrets that I take my leave of you. These
three short but eventful years have been the happiest and most re-
warding of my life, not only because service here is the dream of every
man of law and because of the opportunities for creative and useful
work, but also because of the kindness and fellowship which each of
you has shown to me.
As you must know, only the most compelling call to duty could
bring me to leave this Court and your dedicated and joyous company.
But that call did come, and I could not refuse.
In those days and years ahead allotted to me, my thoughts will often
be of you and your unstinting efforts to bring equal justice under law
to all of our countrymen. And I trust that I shall enjoy the benefit
of your prayers as I undertake my part in our country's striving to
bring peace and the rule of law to all mankind.
Sincerely yours,
THE CHIEF JUSTICE.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS.
MR. JUSTICE CLARK.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN.
MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN

HONORABLE ARTHUR J. GOLDBERG,
United States Representative to the United Nations,
New York, New York.
DEAR AMBASSADOR GOLDBERG:
Your letter advising us of your resignation from the Court was
received with deep regret. In the three years you were with us, you
became so much a part of the Court and of our lives that we shall miss
you greatly.
We fully realize that your decision to leave was a difficult one to
make. And we also realize that in making that decision you were
moved by a profound sense of duty to our country and to the world
of which we are all a responsible part. Men of your stature do not
resist a call to duty in times of crisis regardless of the sacrifice involved,
and we honor you for obeying the demand of your conscience. Also,
we believe that those great qualities which made you an invaluable
member of this Court will guide you in your efforts to achieve honor-
able peace for everyone in this troubled world.
Our heartfelt good wishes will always be with you, and we will feel
that as you pursue your cause our ties to you will be continuously
strengthened regardless of the time or distance between us.
Sincerely,
1
EARL WARREN.

No. 224, Misc. Florence Simmons, petitioner, v. Union News Co.,
a New York Corporation. Petition for writ of certiorari to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit denied. Dissenting
opinion by Mr. Justice Black with whom the Chief Justice concurs:
"I would grant certiorari in this case. While petitioner presents
other interesting and important questions concerning the right of trial
by jury under the Seventh Amendment and concerning the power of a
district court to grant summary judgment, my opinion is addressed to
the question of whether the courts below were right in denying peti-
tioner Simmons a court trial of her claim that she had been wrongfully
discharged without 'just cause' in violation of the collective bargaining
agreement under which she was employed. The ground for refusing
to let her try her case was that her employer and her union had agreed
among themselves that her discharge was for 'just cause.' I think
the courts below were wrong. The material facts upon which I base
my conclusion are these:
"Petitioner was one of about a dozen employees working at the
lunch counter in respondent's restaurant in a railway station. For
about a year prior to petitioner's discharge, profits at the lunch counter
lagged behind those expected by respondent. Respondent suspected
that this was due either to the mishandling or to the actual stealing
of its funds or goods. The collective bargaining agreement provided
that no employee should be discharged without 'just cause' and that
prospective discharges would be discussed by the employer and the
union. Pursuant to the contract, the company's representative went
to the union's representative to discuss what could be done in order to
improve the profit situation at the lunch counter. The company rep-
resentative suggested that all of the counter employees be discharged
and others take their places. The union representative objected. Af-
ter lengthy negotiations, however, a plan was agreed upon by the
company and the union under which five of the employees would be
immediately laid off for a two-week period. If at the end of the

MONDAY, OCTOBER 18, 1965
67
period, records indicated that there was a significant improvement in
the company's business at the lunch counter, it was agreed that the
five employees were to be discharged. The five were laid off including
the petitioner and Gladys Hildreth.¹ When the company convinced
the union that the lunch counter profits had increased during the pe-
riod, the union agreed with respondent that the workers should be
discharged permanently. Both petitioner and Miss Hildreth vigor-
ously protested. They urged the union to carry their protest all the
way up through the various stages of negotiations leading to arbitra-
tion. The union representative, however, refused to give any help to
petitioner and Miss Hildreth. Then, petitioner, by herself, took the
matter up with the company, endeavoring to settle it as a personal
grievance of her own. The company refused to negotiate with peti-
tioner in any way whatever, notwithstanding § 9(a) of the National
Labor Relations Act 2 which states in part, 'That any individual em-
ployee or a group of employees shall have the right at any time to
present grievances to their employer and to have such grievances
adjusted, without the intervention of the bargaining representative, as
long as the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of a collective
bargaining agreement then in effect.' Petitioner, out of a job, then
brought this action against the company for the alleged breach of
contract in discharging her."
"Although this Court has gone very far in some of its cases with
reference to the power of a collective bargaining union to process
the personal grievances of its members, it has not yet gone so far as to
say that where there is a personal grievance for breach of a collective
bargaining agreement, the employee can be deprived of an independent
judicial determination of the claim by an agreement between the
union and the employer that no breach exists. But this is exactly what
was done to petitioner and Miss Hildreth. Though I dissented in Re-
public Steel Corp. v. Maddox, 379 U.S. 650, I was, and still am of the
belief that the majority opinion purported to preserve the right of
an employee to sue his employer if his union refused to press his
grievances. However, I fear that the decisions below in the Hildreth
case and in this one go a long way toward effectively destroying what-
ever redress this Court left the individual employee in Maddox. The
courts below refused to make their own determination of whether
Miss Hildreth's and petitioner's discharges were made for 'just cause.'
Instead they allowed the employer's defense that 'just cause' was sim-
ply what the employer and the union jointly wanted it to be. While
we often say that nothing is decided by a denial of certiorari, all of
1 See Union News Company v. Hildreth, 295 F. 2d 658; Hildreth v. Union News Company,
315 F. 2d 548; certiorari denied, 375 U.S. 826.

MONDAY, OCTOBER 18, 1965

us know that a denial of certiorari in this case, following the denial
of certiorari in the Hildreth case, will undoubtedly lead people to
believe, and I fear with cause, that this Court is now approving such a
forfeiture of contractual claims of individual employees.
"This case points up with great emphasis the kind of injustice
that can occur to an individual employee when the employer and the
union have such power over the employee's claim for breach of contract.
Here no one has claimed from the beginning to the end of the Hildreth
lawsuit or this lawsuit that either of these individuals was guilty of
any kind of misconduct justifying their discharges. Each was one
of twelve employees engaged in the operation of a lunch counter. In
the Hildreth case respondent's supervisor testified that he had no
knowledge that any of the employees discharged were in any way
responsible for the lunch counter's unsuccessful operation. The man-
ager of the lunch counter stated that he did not know of "one single
thing" that Miss Hildreth had done to reduce the counter's profits.
We must assume that had petitioner here been given an opportunity
to try her case, the same facts would have appeared. Moreover, peti-
tioner alleges that she was prepared to show that subsequent to her
discharge, the office girl who counted the money received at the lunch
counter was found to be embezzling those funds and was discharged
for it. Miss Hildreth had worked for respondent for nine and one-
half years, and petitioner for fifteen years, prior to their discharges.
There is no evidence that respondent had ever been dissatisfied with
their work before the company became disappointed with its lunch
counter about a year prior to the discharges. Yet both were dis-
charged for "just cause," as determined not by a court but by an agree-
ment of the company and the union.
"I would not construe the National Labor Relations Act as giving
a union and an employer any such power over workers. In this case
there has been no bargain made on behalf of all the workers repre-
sented by the union. Rather there has been a sacrifice of the rights
of a group of employees based on the belief that some of them might
possibly have been guilty of some kind of misconduct that would re-
duce the employer's profits. Fully recognizing the right of the col-
lective bargaining representative to make a contract on the part of the
workers for the future, I cannot believe that those who passed the
Act intended to give the union the right to negotiate away alleged
breaches of a contract claimed by individual employees.
"The plain fact is that petitioner has lost her job, not because of any
guilt on her part, but because there is a suspicion that some one of the
group which was discharged was guilty of misconduct. The sum total
of what has been done here is to abandon the fine, old American ideal
that guilt is personal. Our system of jurisprudence should not tol-

erate imposing on the innocent, punishment that should be laid on the
guilty. If the construction of the labor law given by the courts be-
low is to stand, it should be clearly and unequivocally announced by
this Court so that Congress can, if it sees fit, consider this question and
protect the just claims of employees from the joint power of employers
and unions."

Mr. Solicitor General Marshall addressed the Court as follows:
"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:
"A meeting of the Bar of the Supreme Court was held at 11:00 this
morning in honor of the memory of Mr. Justice Felix Frankfurter.
Former Solicitor General Cox, who initiated and completed the plans
for that meeting, was selected as chairman, and the Honorable John F.
Davis was selected as secretary of that meeting. Resolutions were
adopted and will be read by Honorable Dean Acheson, chairman
of the Resolutions Committee."
"The resolutions unanimously adopted are as follows:
“‘RESOLUTIONS
"Mr. Justice Frankfurter because of grave impairment of his health
retired on August 28, 1962, from active service on the bench. For
three years, he gallantly bore his afflictions and died on February 22,
1965, in his eighty-third year.
"Felix Frankfurter's birth on November 15, 1882, to Jewish par-
ents in Vienna, Austria, little betokened a career in America as legal

scholar, teacher, and jurist. The family, the Justice has said, was
an intellectual one, though he admits to having been "more bookish"
than the others, excepting his paternal uncle, an "oppressively learned
man," the "librarian-in-chief of the great library of the University
of Vienna." His Viennese origin was treasured by the Justice.
Though time had dimmed memory of detail, he delighted in at-
tributing to it his joie de vivre-what he called the Blue Danube side
of his nature.
"When at the age of twelve Felix Frankfurter landed in New York,
he had never heard a word of English spoken. Two years later, on
graduation from Public School 25, he was reciting Chatham's speech
on the conflict with America. At the school his beloved benefactress,
Miss Hogan, had threatened with the rod any boy caught speaking
German with him. He read omnivorously. At Cooper Union the
periodical room brought on that addiction to newspapers from which
he could never free himself. There, too, were lectures and, above all,
debates ecstatic fare. The reading rooms at the Ottendorfer, the
Astor and the Lenox libraries all knew him.
“His vocabulary, over the years, became immense and exotic. Many
of us have often turned from one of his pages to the dictionary to look
up gallimaufry, for example, or hagiolater or palimpsets. He de-
lighted in English words; but was not so happy with English style.
His continued to be involved, often ornate, carrying a touch of the
baroque. His best writing is his speech transcribed.
""Once he had firm grasp of the language, nothing could stop the
flood of achievement. What enables one to be sympathetic with such
continuous and unqualified success is an initial failure. He had set
his heart on winning a Pulitzer scholarship to the Horace Mann School.
But he failed. Looking back on this disappointment, he found a
curious ground for comfort in accepting kismet. "But if I had gone
to Horace Mann, I would doubtless have gone to Columbia, and beyond
that I don't know-Columbia Law I suppose *** These people
who plan their careers-I have so little respect for them ***” His
path was laid out for him. He followed it with submission and with
joy. It led not to Columbia but to City College and to the Harvard
Law School, the absorbing love of his life.
•
666
""At the turn of the century, student life at City College was more
European than American collegiate. The students lived and studied
in the midst of a great city, not segregated from it but a part of it.
They learned the discipline of hard work in crowded and distracting
conditions, completing half of high school and all of a college course
in five years. They found relaxation in the East Side tea shops and
coffee rooms, drinking tea and rum out of tall glasses and talking with
all comers until dawn. The course was prescribed and rigid. Young

Frankfurter completed it with high honors, gathering on the way yet
another joy from language. He found great interest in the delicacy
and precision of Greek until, unhappily, poor teaching stifled it. For
the most part he taught himself in his usual way. "I read a lot,"
he has reported, “a terrible lot.”
"After City College there was no money for law school, so a year
was set aside to earn some as a clerk in the Tenement House Depart-
ment of the City of New York. Again he toyed with fate. One fine
spring day in 1903, with ten dollars in his pocket, he set out on foot
for Morningside Heights to matriculate at Columbia Law School.
But kismet would no longer be denied and events moved quickly to
settle the matter.
" "The prospective matriculant had not gone far when he met a friend
who persuaded him to spend so fine a day-and the matriculation
fee more fittingly at Coney Island. Soon afterwards the family
doctor, examining his lungs, advised strongly against continuing in
New York and in favor of country air. Finally, a brother of a friend
in the Tenement House Department, a first-year man at Harvard Law
School, home for the Easter holiday, persuaded him that Harvard was
practicable financially, that Cambridge was about as far into the coun-
try as a New Yorker should venture, and that they should room to-
gether the next year. Thus was fate fulfilled and Frankfurter's
distrust of those who plan their lives confirmed.
"Not only the Law School but Harvard University as a whole
offered inexhaustible joys. A Lucullan banquet lay before him or, as
he more earthily put it, "a free lunch counter." "I went to this and
that, went to the library, read, roamed all around, and just satisfied a
gluttonous appetite for lectures, exhibitions, concerts." His roommate
protested; mid-year tests brought him up with a jerk. In all three.
years he led his class, still stubbornly, but more moderately, insisting
that "I don't think law requires that I stifle all other interests." It
never did.
""The addresses this morning recounted Felix Frankfurter's years
before coming to the bench. One would not go wrong in thinking that
these were his happiest, as they were his freest, years. He never
thought of them as years of preparation. They were years of glori-
ously self-justifying life in action. Nonetheless, they gave him rare
insights into the changing social and economic facts of life in this coun-
try, whether he represented the federal government on the legal and
social frontier, or, at the Law School, inspired young men to adventure
by the tales he brought back from his forays into the surrounding
battle.
"Hardly had Frankfurter left the Law School in 1906 for the law
offices of Hornblower, Byrne, Miller and Potter in Manhattan, when
he was lured away by an offer of a 25% reduction in salary and unlim-

MONDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1965
87
ited work. The offer came from Henry L. Stimson, President Theo-
dore Roosevelt's newly appointed United States Attorney for the
Southern District of New York. Frankfurter was inclined to worry
about the ethics of this desertion until Professor Ames wrote him to
"follow the dominant impulses of your nature," which, of course, he
was about to do anyway.
66
'Rarely can a decision or event in a man's life be called crucial.
This was one. Colonel Stimson was a noble man, of towering integ-
rity, an old Roman of the days of the Republic. Frankfurter's
standards of work, of fairness, of integrity—as he himself often said—
were forged in his years with Stimson.
""The times, too, were moving: The Progressive Era was a gestation.
The United States Attorney's office, a storm center in itself, brought
actions against the railroads for rebates, against sugar companies for
customs frauds, against Mr. Charles W. Morse for banking manipula-
tions disclosed by the panic of 1907. Mr. E. H. Harriman was haled
before a United States court to answer questions of the Inter-
state Commerce Commission about his acquisition of control of rail-
roads. The federal government had moved against business. This
was revolution. People spoke of it, said Frankfurter, as they might
have of the attack on the Bastille. But not all the work involved
great matters. The young assistant tried run-of-the-mill criminal
cases on his own and was assigned responsibility for the troubles of
the 100,000 immigrants a month who passed through Ellis Island,
since Stimson thought he was "likely to have more understanding of
these problems than some of the other lads in the office."
""Soon the scene shifted. Stimson left office with Roosevelt and ran
for Governor of New York. Frankfurter was soon in the fight, too,
traveling with both the candidate and his supporter, the former Presi-
dent, and finding politics as absorbing as the law courts. Stimson
lost the election of 1910. Almost at once he went to Washington as
Secretary of War, taking Frankfurter with him.
66 6
'Again a new life opened vistas onto a new world. In 1910 the War
Department was not only the War Office but the Colonial Office and
Office of Public Works as well. Its jurisdiction had followed the flag
in its unplanned course from the Caribbean, across the Isthmus of
Panama, to the Southwest Pacific. Manifest destiny brought in its
train governmental, administrative, and constitutional problems be-
yond the farthest imagination of the framers at Philadelphia. In two
administrations Felix Frankfurter was engaged in adapting eigh-
teenth- and nineteenth-century constitutional conceptions to the world-
encompassing needs of an imperial power.
""When this country entered the First World War, President Wilson
called him back to Washington for a task as different as it was tough.

Industrial disorder in the West and Southwest was paralyzing war
production. A syndicalist movement, the Industrial Workers of the
World, had taken over labor at the copper mines, lumber camps, and
some other vital industries. It was being met by organized vigilantes
using arms and deportation. The President's Mediation Commission,
a group of realists under the chairmanship of Secretary of Labor Wil-
liam B. Wilson and with Felix Frankfurter as Counsel, plunged into
this cauldron of hatred. One situation after another yielded to calm-
ness and persistence. Counsel's contribution, it is not surprising to
learn, was his resourcefulness in diminishing "hated words" and "the
irrationalities of strife." When Counsel for the Commission went back
to the Law School to resume teaching, he had had rare schooling in
the realities of American industrial life.
""It is accepted belief that the invitation which came in 1914 to join
the faculty of the Harvard Law School posed a difficult decision
for him between the active and the contemplative life. The Justice
himself has given currency to the idea and, indeed, made public a
long memorandum of his own to himself on the pros and cons. But
the difficulty was largely theoretical, since, in fact, Frankfurter never
chose; he embraced both alternatives; he lived two lives without
skimping either one-the life of the teacher and scholar and life in the
firing line of all the conflicts of his time. He rolled them into one.
Scholarship for him was concerned not only with the history of the
past but with the most current reports. Significantly one of his first
efforts was with other lawyers to indict the witch-hunting excesses of
Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer.
"For twenty-five years Felix Frankfurter's prodigious energies
were concentrated on the growing edge of the law. With Dean Roscoe
Pound he directed the Cleveland Survey of the administration of
criminal justice, a pioneering study. What brought home to Felix
Frankfurter with searing intensity the responsibility of the state in
criminal prosecution were the convictions of two peddlers, Sacco and
Vanzetti, for murder. He believed that their trial had been unfair
and their convictions due to their political and economic beliefs. He
threw himself passionately into the attempt to set aside the convictions.
The controversy rose to international proportions, but the men were
executed.
""Gradually his interest centered on the law applicable to public
agencies, resulting in a phenomenal outpouring of papers, some by his
pupils, some in collaboration with several of them, and others his own
work. These dealt with labor injunctions, judicial review of admin-
istrative decisions, evidence and procedure before administrative
bodies, the history of diversity jurisdiction, and so on. His own work
centered on the constitutional views of Justice Holmes and Brandeis

and Chief Justice Taney, and, in collaboration with James M. Landis,
on a book and annual articles on The Business of the Supreme Court.
Professor Alexander Bickel has written :
"There were great scholars of the Constitution before Mr. Frank-
furter, but he was the first scholar of the Supreme Court. The study
he pursued was not constitutional law, but institutional law. ***
He studied the sources, the volume, and the nature of the Court's busi-
ness, over time and contemporaneously, and perceived anew the Court's
role in American government. **** Felix Frankfurter: A Tribute,
p. 197 (Mendelson ed. 1964).
""The very nature of the Court's position in the scheme of American
government called upon it to be wisely selective in the choice and re-
strained in the number of cases it heard and decided. He had no
patience with charges that in denying review the Court was, as the
press put it, “ducking the issue." The Court was not a knight-errant
sworn to search out and right wrongs and slay dragons of precedent.
It was far better to leave a decision unreviewed than for the Supreme
Court to decide it wrongly or prematurely. He believed that the
issues the Court chose to review should be ripe for decision and needed
time for collective deliberation and decision, and for careful and per-
suasive exposition of the decision so necessary for its acceptance
by the country. Congress had responded most generously to the
Court's request for power to control and limit its own docket; to use
the power effectively required, so he thought, stern selectivity.
"'In 1939 Felix Frankfurter's life seemed firmly and happily settled
in its course at Harvard. Without hesitation he had declined Gov-
ernor Ely's offer of an appointment to the Supreme Judicial Court of
Massachusetts and without regret heard from President Roosevelt
that he could not appoint him to the vacancy on the Supreme Court
left by Justice Cardozo's death. Then without warning or explanation
Roosevelt reversed that decision and sent his nomination to the Sen-
ate. Curiously, for one so frequently in the storm center of con-
troversy, only a few cranks opposed the nomination. The Senate
unanimously confirmed it. The new Justice took his seat on January
30, 1939.
""The year was a turning point in history as well as in the history of
the Supreme Court. Time had just ended the thirty-year war between
judicial conceptions of the nineteenth century and social and economic
conditions of the twentieth, a war into which Professor Frankfurter
had thrown on the side of a modernity his professorial and polemical
powers. When Justice Roberts freed himself from the bonds of
stare decisis in West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U.S. 379 (1937),
the last of the minimum wage cases, "freedom of contract" became an
obsolete phrase and social legislation in the United States could move
forward again. Another powerful obstacle, the Commerce Clause,
200-278-65-

was outflanked by doctrines, not new but long neglected, which Pro-
fessor Frankfurter had advocated. See the chapter on Taney in The
Commerce Clause Under Marshall, Taney and Waite.

'Just as an epoch had ended in the history of the Court, one was
ending in the history of the world. The epoch of the nineteenth cen-
tury, long undermined and tottering, the epoch of One World, of Pax
Europa, which was about to come crashing down about our ears.
Whatever, the new issues of the post-war world and the post-war
Court would be, they would not be those in which the new Justice had
served with such zest under his great heroes and captains, Stimson,
Holmes, and Brandeis.
""The issues changed, but not the nature of the Court or the impera-
tives of its function and of its position in the American government,
and not the ultimates of the democratic faith. More specifically, the
separation of powers, federalism, the First Amendment, procedural
due process, and the integrity and independence of the act of judging,
and even a measure of substantive due process and equal protection―
for Justice Frankfurter as for Professor Frankfurter, these were
constants.
""There is a remarkable coherence and consistency in his outlook
before and after his change of title-most remarkable for one who, be-
for his accession, was so ardently engaged in the pursuit of immediate
practical ends, who before and after spoke so often on almost all im-
portant aspects of the Court's work, and whose professional lifetime
spanned two sharply divided periods in the Court's history. No doubt,
in his journalism especially, sparks were sometimes struck off which
were extinguished and vanished as they rose. But his basic con-
victions, and of course his temperamental inclinations, endured
and had decisive effect on issues old and new, because they were not.
drawn from the issues of the day.
""By nature an impatient man, and equally naturally a reformer, he
managed somehow not to be both together. The struggle to change
social, economic, and political conditions was for him the struggle to
conserve the institutions and the values of the society in changed
conditions. What is to be conserved must first be understood, and un-
derstood afresh, time and again, for its essence and its necessities are
not conveyed by verbal formulas; they reveal themselves only in the
full factual context of the past and present. History and a willingness
to know that the conditions of life change in response to forces that the
law does not create but must recognize-these are the tools of the true
conservative. They were Justice Frankfurter's, as they had been Jus-
tice Brandeis's. In using them, the conservative is a creative reformer.

'During the twenty-three years of Justice Frankfurter's tenure, the
Court not only abandoned old constitutional restraints on social and
economic reform, but adopted fresh and hospitable habits of statutory
construction. And it opened for itself new and important lines of in-
fluence under the First Amendment, in the administration of criminal
justice, and in effectuating equal treatment of the races. In these enter-
prises Justice Frankfurter participated and often led. The reappor-
tionment case of 1962, Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, was the only major
new departure against which the Justice wholly and firmly set his
face, and perhaps the final word has not yet been said.
""Justice Frankfurter participated and led, but after his fashion,
subject to the cautions and restraints that were deeply imbedded in his
view of the judicial function and in his philosophy of history and of
government. Whether he led or participated or dissented, he left his
mark on the evolution of the principles announced by the Court, and,
therefore, on their content, on the timing and manner of their an-
nouncement, and on the methods chosen to enforce them.
"'From the beginning to the end of his service, in an unrelenting line
of decisions, he faithfully realized the promise of the Fifteenth Amend-
ment. Lane v. Wilson, 307 U.S. 268 (1939); Terry v. Adams, 345 U.S.
461 (1953); Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339 (1960). His apt
sentence, in the first of these cases, "The Amendment nullifies sophis-
ticated as well as simple-minded modes of discrimination," (307
U.S., at 275) can serve as a chapter heading for the Court's achieve-
ments under both the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.
"In the field of criminal law, Justice Frankfurter insisted upon
civilized standards of justice in the federal courts, objecting to pro-
cedures which he believed impaired basic liberties. See Harris v.
United States, 331 U.S. 145, 155 (1947). He was not troubled that
constitutional safeguards were so often invoked by dubious characters
(id., at 156), insisting upon "conviction of the guilty by methods that
commend themselves to a progressive and self-confident society,"
McNabb v. United States, 318 U.S. 332, 344 (1943). In the McNabb
case and in Mallory v. United States, 354 U.S. 449 (1957), Justice
Frankfurter, speaking for the Court, held inadmissible confessions
obtained in protracted post-arrest interrogation before arraignment
and without counsel for the defense.
""The role of the Supreme Court in reviewing state-court criminal
proceedings he saw as limited to guaranteeing that "fundamental
principles of liberty and justice" are upheld. McNabb v. United
States, supra, p. 340. He acknowledged that there were many issues
on which sincere exponents of constitutional rights could differ; reso-
lution of these issues he believed to be the province of the state courts
in the exercise of their judgment. See id., at 340; Wolf v. Colorado,
338 U.S. 25 (1949). Where, however, state courts refused to protect

individuals from conduct offending the basic canons of decency and
fairness, Justice Frankfurter did not hesitate to act. Rochin v. Cali-
fornia, 342 U.S. 165 (1952).
""Courts in a democratic society, he thought, should defer to elected
officials who had resolved conflicting legislative policies, retaining only
the determination whether legislation is so unrelated to the experi-
ence and feelings of the community as to be destructive of popular
rights. American Federation of Labor v. American Sash & Door
Co., 335 U.S. 538, 542 (1949) (concurring opinion). Popular rule
he saw as a moral and practical imperative, a view which led him to
support the constitutionality of the Smith Act, Dennis v. United
States, 341 U.S. 494, 517 (1951) (concurring in affirmance), and of
the compulsory flag salute in West Virginia's public schools, required
without regard to religious scruples, Flag Salute Cases, 310 U.S. 586
(1940), 319 U.S. 624, 646 (1943) (dissenting opinion).
"He often said that "the most fundamental principle of consti-
tutional adjudication is not to face constitutional questions but to
avoid them, if at all possible." United States v. Lovett, 328 U.S. 303,
320 (1946) (concurring opinion). That this is not a negative prin-
ciple in the hands of a resourceful judge, the Justice showed when
he found a way to depart for the first time in over half a century from
the judicial practice of "hands off" congressional investigations.
United States v. Rumely, 345 U.S. 41 (1953).
"'Yet when time and occasion were ripe, he did not shrink from
the duty of judicial review. The historian of the Court will find
Justice Frankfurter solidly aligned in the great collegial effort of
school desegregation cases, Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S.
483 (1954), 349 U.S. 294 (1955); Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1, 20
(1958) (concurring opinion). He insisted that a mature and self-
reliant people were not meant to be insulated from the printed word
as if they were children, Butler v. Michigan, 352 U.S. 380 (1957);
and in the same spirit that the college classroom may not be the object
of official intrusion, Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234, 255
(1957).
""Idealist, optimist, and teacher, he found in Justice Holmes, his
hero, his inspiration, a joy and spur to his spirit. Justice Brandeis
was his mentor and guide. Like the latter he saw himself performing
an educational role. He was a teacher because of his faith in democ-
racy. With rare exceptions, he accepted the consequences of popular
rule, and did not lightly brandish the Constitution to ward them off.
If the people erred, the remedy for the most part was eduction.
""But he was a professor as well as a teacher, and could not shed
the habits of the classroom, which are not perhaps the most useful
or becoming for the teacher-at-large. He delighted in recounting how
more than once Chief Justice Hughes at Conference would begin to

MONDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1965
93
address him as "Professor Frankfurter" before quickly correcting
himself to "Justice Frankfurter." Characteristically this ended on
one occasion with the Justice telling the Chief Justice that he need
not apologize in correcting himself. "I know of no title that I deem
more honorable than that of Professor of the Harvard Law School."
(Of Law and Life and Other Things That Matter, p. 28.) It is a safe
surmise that the teacher and practitioner of communicable reason,
and the professor, manifested themselves not only in published opin-
ions but in Conference and in the other intimate relations of the Jus-
tices. An independent and even a surprisingly private person, he
had a religious respect for the independence of others. But the Court
is in its way a continuous seminar, in and out of session, and we may
be sure that Justice Frankfurter was a vigorous and continuous
participant.
"As much as any of the men who have sat here, no less than
Justices Brandeis or Van Devanter or Chief Justice Taft, he was
painstakingly interested in the Court's methods and routines of con-
ducting its business. In a small group of self-reliant men working
with very little staff, he thought nothing too trivial for improvement,
nor any effort too great to foster the most favorable atmosphere for
maturing the Court's deliberative process. Only those who served
with him can yet know the full value of his contribution to the inner
organization and procedure of the Court. Outsiders may speak how-
ever of Justice Frankfurter's deep attachment to an institution, which
was the focus of his professional life for over half a century.
""The attachment was passionate and idealistic. He loved the
Court not so much for what it was as for what it could be. If he
felt on occasion that it fell short of his ideal, he scolded, pointing to
what he believed to be faults and defects. For in the Court, the object
of his passion, he could find no shortcomings tolerable. He had a
vision, at once splendid and precise, restricted and magisterial, of
the greatness of the Court's calling. Greatness for this Court, he
held, was not a mere aspiration, but a duty and a necessity: Where-
fore, it is

'Resolved, That we, the Bar of the Supreme Court of the United
States, deeply saddened by the death of Mr. Justice Frankfurter,
record our loss of the guidance and inspiration of a mentor who led
some of us into the study of the law and whose influence from the
Bench has brought out the professional best in all of us, both by his
clear delight in it and by his impatience with less; of a judge who
joined learning in the law and its history with love and respect for
it, and added to his profound knowledge of this Court, its history
and its business, veneration for its unique and powerful place in our
government; of a fellow citizen whose intense love of our country
compelled complete devotion to its precious and unique values and to

the preservation of the institutions designed to safeguard them: It is
further
"Resolved, That the Chairman of our Committee on Resolutions
be directed to present these Resolutions to the Court with the prayer
that they be embodied in its permanent records." "
Mr. Attorney General Katzenbach addressed the Court as follows:
"Mr. Chief Justice, May It Please the Court:
"The Bar of this Court met this morning in memory of Felix
Frankfurter, who was an Associate Justice of the Court from January
30, 1939, until August 28, 1962, and who died on February 22, 1965.
Few men have devoted as much of themselves to this Court-it was,
as the Justice said in expressing to the President his reluctance at
leaving the Court, 'the institution whose concerns have been the abid-
ing interest of any life'-and few men have had so much of themselves
to give: His was a towering intellect; he had the keenest of minds and
the most facile of pens; he brought to the Court his boundless love of
life and his work; and his understanding of the Nation and respect for
its institutions could not have been more profound. Unquestionably,
his service here was the triumphant culmination of the life of one of
the great public men of the Century, as well as one of the brightest
chapters in this Court's distinguished history.
"I need not remind those who are gathered here of the emptiness
which his passing has left. In this room especially we recall the vivid
and crackling excitement which was inevitably generated when he
questioned counsel-challenged would perhaps be more appropriate—
or delivered an opinion. Those marks of the Justice are lost to us
except in memory. Nor shall I attempt to speak of his rich and varied
life and accomplishments outside the Court. Let me speak rather of
what I believe to be his principal legacy to this and later generations-
his forcefully articulated conception of the role of courts, and in
particular of this Court, in the American political system.
"We should first understand something of the background and ex-
perience of the man. As a poor immigrant boy who by sheer force of
intellect and character achieved great eminence in the public life of his
adopted country, he knew at first hand, and passionately believed in,
the promise of American life. The years before he came to the Court,
moreover, coincided with the great reform era of the first decades of
this century a period when Congress and the President, and even
more, perhaps, State legislatures, were embarking upon programs of
bold experimentation in social justice and reform. In that day,
judicial decisions which took a restrictive view of the regulatory powers
of the State and the Nation were a major stumbling block. Himself
an impassioned reformer, Justice Frankfurter saw that the American
experiment with democracy is a workable one-that government by
the people through their elected representatives can be vital and

MONDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1965
95
progressive; and he saw that the courts of that day, in contrast, were
remote from popular currents, and consequently ill adapted to func-
tion as an independent organ of social policy.
"His career in government and as a professor of law at Harvard
confirmed the lessons of his youth. He came into contact with Holmes,
Brandeis and Learned Hand, whom he revered and whose fundamental
views he shared, although he imbued those views both with his own
passionate nature and with his own unique sense of the values of
American institutions. His own researches added to his knowledge.
His brilliant pioneering study of the labor injunction, for example,
showed that there might be areas of social conflict to the resolution of
which the processes of the courts were inherently ill suited. More
important, at Harvard he became the first systematic student of the
Supreme Court as an institution. He acquired a scholar's understand-
ing of its strengths and limitations, and came to believe in the Court's
indispensable historic role as the arbiter of fundamental conflicts of
power within the American political system, concluding that its
success in this role depended in very significant measure upon scrupu-
lous adherence to the procedures and limitations of a court of law.
"Perhaps the most important result of his years as a law professor
specializing in the study of this Court was that he became imbued
with a tenacious faith in reason, and in this Court as its embodiment
in the political structure. Almost a quarter century of brilliant and
lively teaching, scholarship, and polemics did not fail to instill in
him a profound belief in the efficacy of the rational processes of the
law and a reverence for this Court as the institution of government
pre-eminently fitted to bring these processes to bear upon the nation's
fundamental problems-which, as de Tocqueville observed, are in-
evitably presented sooner or later in judicial questions.
"These themes-faith in the American democratic experiment and
reverence for this Court as the embodiment of reason applied to the
problems of government-explain, I think, much of Justice Frank-
furter's matured conception of the Court's role. Congress and the
State legislatures, the basic organs of representative government,
in his view, designed to make social policy; the Court was not.
The Court must, therefore, in Justice Frankfurter's view, be most
cautious in the exercise of its power to invalidate legislation on con-
stitutional grounds.
were,
"The same result followed by a slightly different route. If the
Court were truly to exemplify the application of reason to goverment,
it would have to respect the competencies of the other organs of gov-
ernment-Congress and the President; State courts and legislatures,
federal trial judges and the federal regulatory agencies. If it went
too far afield, in the long run it would only weaken itself. To the
same end of preserving the Court's prestige and effectiveness, he felt
v

MONDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1965
96
that it should adhere scrupulously to the procedures and traditions of
a court of law, declining to pass upon any but cases in which the issues
were focused and the facts digested in accordance with the strict re-
quirements of the adjudicative process, and discharging its duties at
all times with meticulous craftsmanship and impartiality.
"It is popular today to speak of Justice Frankfurter's philosophy of
the role of courts as one of ‘judicial self restraint.' Thus phrased,
the Justice's ideology becomes a negative conception and, indeed, a
most implausible one in light of the man. For Felix Frankfurter was
not a man who was either restrained or detached; he was, quite to the
contrary, both deeply passionate and consumingly involved. 'He was,’
as Professor Mansfield (a former law clerk) said on the occasion of
his death, 'the most unreserved of men.' His view of his proper role
as a judge did, it is true, require him more than once to sustain poli-
cies and results irreconcilably at war with his personal predilections,
and in this particular sense he may be said to have been restrained. A
sharp example of such a dilemma early in his judicial career occurred
in the second flag salute case, where the Justice found himself in dis-
sent from a decision holding that a member of Jehovah's witnesses
could not constitutionally be compelled by a State legislature to par-
ticipate in a patriotic ceremony contrary to his religious beliefs. Rec-
ognizing, with unusual candor and eloquence, the line between his per-
sonal views and those he believed to be imposed upon the State legis-
lature by the Constitution, the Justice said:
""One who belongs to the most vilified and persecuted minority
in history is not likely to be insensible to the freedom guaranteed by
our Constitution. Were my purely personal attitude relevant I should
wholeheartedly associate myself with the general libertarian views in
the Court's opinion, representing as they do the thought and action of
a lifetime. But as judges we are neither Jew nor Gentile, neither
Catholic nor agnostic. We owe equal attachment to the Constitution
and are equally bound by our judicial obligations whether we derive
our citizenship from the earliest or the latest immigrants to these
shores.'
"That he nevertheless did not veer from his conception of the proper
limitations of the Court bespeaks his fidelity to principle and his strong
intellectual self-discipline. But it relects much more as well—and I
come now to a second important aspect of his contribution to our politi-
cal and judicial philosophy. It was his belief that the Court's circum-
scribed role was a necessary corollary to the vigorous and progressive
exercise of the policy-making function by the political organs of gov-
ernment, to which that function has been primarily entrusted by the
Constitution, as it must be in a free society. To be sure, he did not
hesitate to invalidate laws fundamentally incompatible with democ-
racy; his consistent position in the civil rights area bears witness to

MONDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1965
97
that. He taught not a universal solvent for constitutional problems,
but, rather, a fundamental attitude: To equate strong distaste for a
statute with its unconstitutionality would unduly stifle, and might ulti-
mately destroy, the creative forces of democracy-upon which, re-
sponsibly exercised, we ultimately depend for progress and for liberty.
Courts cannot undertake comprehensively to exercise a policy-making
role, and they must take care not to destroy the responsibility of those
who do.
"These principles received a severe test near the close of Justice
Frankfurter's judicial career, in the reapportionment case (Baker v.
Carr). The ill which the Court was asked to confront was a malady
of representative government itself, a malady, moreover, of the utmost
gravity and nationwide in scope. Since a malapportioned legislature
could hardly be expected voluntarily to reapportion itself equitably,
Justice Frankfurter was faced with the hardest of choices: between
judicial action that in his view would only harm the Court without
promising a satisfactory solution to the problem of unequal represen-
tation (a problem that he considered political rather than judicial in
character); and judicial inaction which would leave the problem with-
out foreseeable solution. He chose the first horn of this dilemma. He
spoke in these words:
❝6*** (T) here is not under our Constitution a judicial remedy
for every political mischief, for every undesirable exercise of legis-
lative power. The framers carefully and with deliberate forethought
refused so to enthrone the judiciary. In this situation, as in others
of like nature, appeal for relief does not belong here. Appeal must
be to an informed, civically militant electorate. In a democratic
society like ours, relief must come through an aroused popular con-
science that sears the conscience of the people's representatives.'
"I shall not presume to appraise the choice made. My point is that
for him this was no empty rhetoric; the principles of separation of
power and federalism were living guidelines, not mere cliches.
"In short, Justice Frankfurter's conception of judicial self-restraint
was not solely, or even primarily, focused upon inhibiting judicial
power as such. To be sure, he was concerned that expanding the
Court's role beyond what he conceived to be its proper limits would
deflect the Court from more basic duties and impair its ability to
discharge them adequately, and also that, outside the limited sphere of
its competency, the Court would not be able to provide viable solutions
to social and political problems. But he viewed the problem, at the
same time, in the positive light of promoting a democratic and just
society. The choice to abstain in many vital areas was for him a prac-
tical and acceptable, and, if painful, still not intolerable, choice, be-
cause he believed that in the final reckoning the representative organs
of government must be relied upon to do, not shirk, their job. And
1

MONDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1965
98
he was convinced that the Court, if it took upon itself the task of
righting all of the nation's social wrongs, would find itself ill-equipped,
while at the same time encouraging the political organs to shed their
rightful burdens. They could be expected to act most responsibly only
if accorded the full and awesome responsibility for making policy and
political judgments; the best thing the Court could do, therefore, was
to place the responsibility squarely where it belonged.
"I have tried to suggest that Justice Frankfurter's view of the Court
as an institution constrained to act within rigorous limits rested not
so much on a negative view of the Court's power and competence, but
more on an affirmative faith in reason, democracy, and the genius and
fortune of the American political system to secure just solutions for
essentially social or political problems outside the judicial arena. This
faith did not exclude an important role for the Court. On the con-
trary, it suggested several important creative functions. Let me men-
tion, in the first place the Court's unique function as a teacher (as the
Justice himself had been) and exemplar. We see this in the form and
texture of his opinions. Written to instruct, explicit about their as-
sumptions and implications, freighted with history and learning, they
set a new style in judicical opinion-writing. We saw it too in his prob-
ing questions from the bench and his lively exchanges with counsel.
The Court, he said, is ‘a tribunal not designed as a dozing audience for
the rendering of soliloquies' but 'a questioning body, utilizing oral ar-
guments as a means for exposing the difficulties of a case with a view
towards meeting them.'
"As another example of the Court's creative role, consider his con-
sistent attitude toward the other organs of government whose actions
or enactments he was called upon to enforce and review. While vigor-
ously upholding their autonomy (as in his famous Pottsville opinion),
and reluctant to second-guess their substantive determinations, he was
aggressive in interpreting statutes so as to effectuate Congress' basic
purpose (however imperfectly expressed in the statutory language),
and in enforcing procedural regularity to compel the policy-making
organs to act responsibly.
"As a reader of statutes-really the bulk of the Court's business-
Justice Frankfurter drew upon his great understanding of the Nation
and its processes. He was impatient with mechanical literalism di-
vorced from the underlying purpose. In speaking of the Fourth
Amendment, he once wrote: "These words are not just a literary com-
position. They are not to be read as they might be read by a man who
knows English but has no knowledge of the history that gave rise to
the words.' He was realistic in his assessment of the practical limita-
tions of the legislative process-the inabililty to provide for every con-
tingency of statutory application; the difficulty of verbal precision in
instruments whose phrasing is inevitably a product of compromise.

MONDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1965
99
He also refused to abandon hope of finding behind a statute a coherent
legislative design that would give meaning and direction to the search
for the 'intent' of Congress. This quest for purpose involved much
more, of course, than resort to the committee reports and the record of
debate. To him the legislative history of an Act comprised the history
of prior enactments in the field, the mood and temper of the legislators,
the events that gave rise to the legislative proposals, the changes the
bill underwent before it assumed its final enacted form. Above all, he
tried to understand the nature of the problem that had called forth the
legislative response. If the Court could divine the legislators' prob-
lem and trace in the rough the indicated lines of their solution, it was
obligated to give the statute a construction that would help to achieve
their end.
"This creative and masterful sensitivity in the interpretation of
statutes was surely one of the most fruitful products of his conception
of the Court's role. I emphasize that it was, indeed, rooted in that
conception. His faith in representative government implied to him a
commitment to use the special resources of the judiciary-power and
skill in analysis and clarification-to help make the legislative process
viable and productive, and his faith in Reason committed him to bring
to the task of meaningful statutory construction all the tools of cogent
analysis; history and scholarship, imagination and understanding,
practical experience and common sense. The bold results of his ap-
proach are particularly evident in his famous opinions in the labor
field, from Phelps Dodge to the second Garmon case.
"Justice Frankfurter's view of the Court's role also underlay his
pioneering approach to cases involving a challenge to the validity of
official action. He showed that the Court had a salutary role to play in
encouraging responsible action. We see this most clearly in his opin-
ions reviewing administrative decisions. In the early years of his
career on the Court, such review had already gone through two phases.
In the first, agency action that seemed to exceed lawful bounds had
been unhesitatingly struck down, without more. In the second phase-
a reaction to the first-the tendency had been to uphold agency action
almost as a matter of course, and to exercise little judicial control over
the administrative process. Justice Frankfurter found a middle
ground between the extremes of judicial supervision and abdication-
requiring that the agencies conform to procedures calculated to maxi-
mize the prospects for wise and rational decisions, while refusing in
general to review the substantive wisdom of a decision responsibly
made.
"His view of the Court's function in such cases is exemplified by his
landmark opinion in the first Chenery case. The agency, in its opinion,
had placed decision on one ground; in defending the decision in the
Supreme Court, the agency's appellate staff relied heavily on a differ-

MONDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1965
100
ent ground. Speaking for the Court, Mr. Justice Frankfurter held
such a procedure impermissible. Congress had lodged the respon-
sibility for decision in the members of the agency, and not in their
appellate lawyers. If agency action was to be upheld, it should be on
a ground considered and adopted by the agency itself. Only then
would there be assurance that agency policy was being formulated.
deliberately and that responsibility was being assumed, not evaded,
by those whom Congress made responsible.
"This notion is epitomized in a memorable sentence from Justice
Frankfurter's McNabb opinion: 'The history of liberty has largely
been the history of observance of procedural safeguards.' What he
meant, I believe, was that if the courts did no more than compel offi-
cials to follow fair and proper procedures in enforcing the law-
procedures that would require them to reason before deciding and to
explain the basis of their actions-substantive rights would inevitably
flourish.
"Consider also Justice Frankfurter's devout insistence that the Court
must never permit itself to become a party to injustice; never allow
its image as an institution of reason and conscience to become tar-
nished. This lies at the root of the Justice's steadfast stand against the
admission of confessions obtained by the third degree or other illegal
means. A conviction based on such methods could not be upheld
without condoning wilful disregard of our society's basic norms of
fair procedure, and hence should not, he reasoned, be tolerated by the
Court. The same idea explains his frank refusal to uphold convictions
based on methods shocking to the conscience. His standard in the
famous stomach-pump case (Rochin v. California) rested on a bold
and forthright, not a negative or passive, view of the Court's role in
the American governmental system-as the keeper of the public con-
science.
"His emphasis on procedure and on the Court's duty to avoid injus-
tice led him to play an active and forward role in the area of federal
criminal justice. For example, it was Justice Frankfurter who, in the
McNabb case, significantly advanced the fertile concept that this Court
has a broad 'supervisory authority' over the procedures of the lower
federal courts in criminal cases. And in other areas where the elabora-
tion of policy was peculiarly appropriate for courts-such as the en-
forcement of the Fourth Amendment-he was also in the forefront.
"In these remarks, I have made no effort to encompass or evaluate
all of Justice Frankfurter's rich contributions to the law, this Court,
and the Nation. I have concentrated on his view of the Court's role
in society because it seems to me that there may be a particular value
in reminding ourselves of the fullness, the maturity, and the affirma-
tiveness of his view. To be sure, his philosophy is open to challenge
both generally and in its application to specific cases. Men of original-

ity and greatness are inevitably men of controversy, and the Justice
relished such battles. The heart of the matter lies beyond agreement.
or disagreement. Justice Frankfurter contributed to the jurispru-
dence of this Court a coherent, articulate, and rounded conception of
its place and function in the firmament of the American system. And
to the law as a whole he brought a devotion to the process of achieving
justice through reason. Few have left so rich a legacy.
"May it please this Honorable Court: In the name of the lawyers of
this Nation, and particularly of the Bar of this Court, I respectfully
request that the resolution presented to you in memory of the late
Justice Felix Frankfurter be accepted by you, and that it, together
with the chronicle of these proceedings, be ordered kept for all time
in the records of this Court.”
The Chief Justice said:
"MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL:
"You and Mr. Acheson honor the Court in presenting to us these
Resolutions of the Bar concerning the life and passing of our late
lamented Brother, Felix Frankfurter, and your felicitous words honor
the profession of which we are all a part and in which he so greatly
distinguished himself for more than a half century as scholar, teacher,
advocate, administrator and jurist.
"Felix Frankfurter was the 78th Justice appointed to this Court.
Only 18 Justices served longer than did he, and none with greater
devotion or distinction. In the 23 years he graced this Bench, he
wrote 263 opinions for the Court, 171 concurring opinions, and 291
dissenting opinions, making a total of 725, thus bringing into sharp
focus, as he was admirably equipped to do, the argumentative issues
in the problems which confront us. These opinions cover a myriad
of facets of American jurisprudence and are to be found in Volumes
306 to 369 of the United States Reports. Some of these have already
been noted in the Resolutions which you present and still others in
your personal remarks. You have pointed up sharply both his legal
philosophy and his application of it to the problems of his day.
"It would serve no good purpose to elaborate on them further at
these proceedings because they are already recorded with us in a man-
ner that will make them available to the Bench, the Bar, and legal
scholars so long as constitutional principles are a matter of concern
in this and other lands. And so long as they are scrutinized, they will
command respect and strike sparks of interest that otherwise might be
overlooked. It should, therefore, be sufficient to say that in com-
posite they portray his profound belief in and knowledge of constitu-
tional principles, his deep sense of patriotism, and his lifelong devotion
to the Court as an institution.
"His patriotism was of a passionate kind. Like many others who
have come here from other lands to live their lives in freedom, he
'

MONDAY, OCTOBER 25, 1965
102
had the deep-seated and abiding appreciation of the institutions of his
adopted country. While so many others who are born here accept
freedom as their birthright and fail to appreciate the necessity of
guarding it zealously, he acted always as a sentinel on watch. Felix
Frankfurter was ever grateful for his citizenship.
"He was accustomed to telling young people that they, too, should be
grateful for it and that, like the Romans, they should consider citizen-
ship as an office. He always asserted that the basis of good citizenship
is discipline self-discipline and that Government, like individuals,
should be self-disciplined. He believed fervently in the separa-
tion of powers and in the division of powers, and that every Branch
of the Government as well as every level of Government should respect
the others, and that by self-discipline each should confine its own
activities strictly to its assigned functions. He believed that trouble-
some as some of the problems inherent in it are, Federalism is the
genius of our institutions, and that it must be preserved in pristine
form.
"Justice Frankfurter started early in life to discipline himself for
citizenship. Two years after his arrival in this country at the age of
twelve, he mastered the English language, and in due time graduated
from College and Harvard School of Law. He was an assiduous
student and an indefatigable reader. In neither capacity did he con-
fine himself to the law; in neither did he have any bounds for his
research. The economic, social and political problems of the day, the
history behind them, as well as the current news were of equal interest
to him. All of this later was reflected in his work on the Court.
"He believed citizens should serve their Government, and he did so
avidly whenever called upon to do so, either full time or part time, both
before and during the quarter of a century he was a Professor at
Harvard. His governmental assignments were many and varied. The
subjects he taught at the Law School and his writings were equally
varied, but he always focused on the Supreme Court, its jurisprudence,
its procedures, and its place in our Government. It is doubtful if
anyone who has sat on this Court came to it better prepared for his
task. In his twenty-three years here, his interest in our problems and
all of life never flagged.
"How he loved knotty problems! He liked to research them; he
delighted in enlightening the Court with his memoranda on difficult
questions; he reveled in discussing them at Conference. His last active
hour on the Court was spent lecturing on the history of the Interstate
Commerce Commission on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of
that agency. He never ceased to be a teacher. He believed implicitly
in Mr. Justice Holmes' statement that a page in history is worth a
volume of logic.

"Yes, we miss him greatly. We miss his spontaneity; we miss his
wit, his charm, and his fellowship. We also miss his occasional impa-
tience when he thought the Court was departing from the standards
he conceived for it. It was always therapeutic. He was a genial col-
league as well as a great Justice.
"I believe Justice Frankfurter would have approved of this kind
of Memorial Session of the Court where his friends are gathered in
such numbers and where they not only deplore his loss to the Nation as
one of its great public servants, but also where they give vent to their
joy and satisfaction of having the privilege of knowing him and bask-
ing in the warm glow of his friendship.
"Mr. Attorney General; Mr. Acheson: On behalf of the Court, I
thank you for your fine presentations today, and I ask you to convey,
if you will, please, to all the friends of Mr. Justice Frankfurter and
his family our concurrence with them in their devotion to his memory.
"Let the Resolutions be spread upon the Minutes of this Court."
Adjourned until Monday, November 8, 1965, at 10 o'clock.
The day call for Monday, November 8, 1965, will be as follows:
Nos. 20, 59 (and 60), and 65.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Present: Mr. Chief Justice Warren, Mr. Justice Black, Mr. Justice
Douglas, Mr. Justice Clark, Mr. Justice Harlan, Mr. Justice Brennan,
Mr. Justice Stewart, Mr. Justice White, and Mr. Justice Fortas.
The Chief Justice said:
"On behalf of the Court, I announce with deep regret the death of
our Librarian, Miss Helen Catherine Newman, on July 21, 1965.
"Miss Newman, a native Washingtonian, received her bachelor of
laws and master of laws degrees from George Washington University
Law School. After her graduation, she served for 15 years as Law
Librarian at her Alma Mater. In 1942, she came to the Court as an
Assistant Librarian. Five years later, on March 31, 1947, she was
appointed Librarian, and in 1948 became an officer of the Court by
law.
"During her long service with the Court and prior thereto, Miss
Newman was active in library, legal, and academic affairs, and partic-
ularly in matters concerning the American Association of Law
Libraries. She was in every sense of the word a professional librarian,
and in her quiet, dignified manner rendered loyal and efficient service
to the Court. She was devoted to the Court, and brought to it many
fine qualities which won for her the respect of the Justices under whom
she served as well as the admiration and friendship of those with whom
she came in contact in the course of her varied duties.
"The Court records its appreciation of Miss Newman's able and con-
scientious service and extends to her surviving relatives its sincere
sympathy.
"On a happier note, I am pleased to announce for the Court the
appointment of Henry Charles Hallam, Jr., to be Librarian of the
Court succeeding Miss Newman.
"Mr. Hallam has long been a trusted and faithful employee of the
Court. He first came here as a Page in 1928, and began his service
with our Library as a Junior Library Assistant in 1935. In 1947, he
was appointed Associate Librarian and has served in that capacity to
the present time. We are confident that Mr. Hallam will continue to
serve efficiently and effectively and that he will be a worthy successor
to the four other individuals who have preceded him in this very
important position with the Court."

of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and our decisions in Cone v.
West Virginia Pulp & Paper Co., 330 U.S. 212; Globe Liquor Co. v.
San Roman, 332 U.S. 571; and Weade v. Dichmann, Wright & Pugh,
337 U.S. 801, to order the case dismissed and thereby deprive peti-
tioner of any opportunity to invoke the trial court's discretion on the
issue of whether petitioner should have a new trial?
"2. Whether the Court of Appeals erred in ordering the District
Court not merely to enter a judgment n.o.v. for respondent but to
dismiss plaintiff's case in view of Rule 50 (c) (2) of the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure which gives a party whose verdict has been set aside
the right to make a motion for a new trial not later than 10 days after
entry of the judgment notwithstanding the verdict?"

respondents, petitioner can then make a motion for a new trial under
Rule 50 (c) (2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure within 10 days
of the District Court's entry of judgment for respondents?

cannot make a motion for new trial under Rule 50 (c) (2) within 10
days of the District Court's entry of judgment against him, the order
of the Court of Appeals directing the District Court to enter judgment
for respondents is compatible with Rule 50(b) as interpreted by this
Court in Cone v. West Virginia Pulp & Paper Co., 330 U.S. 312;
Globe Liquor Co. v. San Roman, 332 U.S. 571; and Weade v. Dich-
mann, Wright & Pugh, 337 U.S. 801?

of judgment for respondents?"

No. 508. Clem McClelland, petitioner, v. Texas. Petitions for
writs of certiorari to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas denied.
Mr. Justice Douglas is of the opinion that certiorari should be granted.
Memorandum of Mr. Chief Justice Warren:
Each of these three cases stems from the following factual
setting:
The Grand Jury of Harris County, Texas, was impaneled on
May 7, 1962, to investigate irregularities in the administration of
the Probate Court. While Grand Jury sessions were proceeding,
the District Attorney of the County, in cooperation with the
Justice of the Peace, took the virtually unprecedented step of
obtaining an order to institute a "Court of Inquiry."
This body, formerly sanctioned by Vernon's Texas Code of
Criminal Procedure, arts. 886, 887, permits a justice of the peace
to summon and examine witnesses and take sworn testimony.
Those who fail to comply with his summons or refuse to make
statements under oath may be fined and imprisoned. From the
year of its enactment-1876-to this date, it appears that the
procedure had been seldom invoked.
The secret Grand Jury deliberations were postponed while the
District Attorney pursued the Court of Inquiry publicly, in front
of the press, radio recorders and television cameras. In this in-
flamed atmosphere, the petitioners were questioned for some four
days, although they objected to testifying. They were not per-
mitted to consult with their attorneys during the proceedings,
to defend themselves, to cross-examine or confront the witnesses
against them, to call witnesses on their behalf, to rebut or to con-
tradict the evidence produced by the prosecution. Two days later,
the Grand Jury was reconvened and brought in indictments
against the petitioners.
Due to a change of venue and continuances secured by the peti-
tioners, their trials did not take place until more than two years
later in a neighboring county. Their pretrial motions to quash
the indictments were denied, in two cases without hearings, and
they were found guilty of the offenses charged.
The Texas Legislature has since repealed the "Court of Inquiry"
proceeding through the adoption of a new Code of Criminal Pro-

It is clear that grave constitutional questions are raised by con-
ducting such a proceeding. See, e.g., Estes v. Texas, 381 U.S.
532; Moore v. Dempsey, 261 U.S. 86, 90-91. Against the back-
ground of the factors mentioned above, the Court has declined
review. Our denial of the petitions for certiorari in these cases
should not be taken in any way as sanctioning the proceedings or
of approving of the judgments below. It means only that "for
one reason or another these cases did not commend themselves to
at least four members of the Court as falling within those con-
siderations which should lead this Court to exercise its discretion
in reviewing a lower court's decision." Memorandum of Mr. Jus-
tice Frankfurter, Sheppard v. Ohio, 352 U.S. 910, 911; see also,

ORDER IN PENDING CASE
No. 1111, Misc. Stephen S. Chandler, United States District
Judge for the Western District of Oklahoma, petitioner, v. Judicial
Council of the Tenth Circuit of the United States. Petitioner applied
to Mr. Justice White, Circuit Justice for the Tenth Circuit, for "Stay
of Order of Judicial Council of the Tenth Circuit of the United States"
in the above matter, and the application was by him referred to the
Court for its consideration and action.
It appearing to the Court from the response of the Solicitor General
to the application that the order from which relief is sought is entirely
interlocutory in character pending prompt further proceedings inquir-
ing into the administration of Judge Chandler of judicial business in
the Western District of Oklahoma, and that at such proceedings Judge
Chandler will be permitted to appear before the Council, with counsel,
and that after such proceedings the Council will, as soon as possible,
undertake to decide what use, if any, should be made of such powers
as it may have in the premises, it is hereby ordered that the applica-
tion for stay be denied pending this contemplated prompt action of
the Judicial Council. The Court expresses no opinion concerning the
propriety of the interlocutory action taken.
Dissenting opinion by Mr. Justice Black with whom Mr. Justice
Douglas joins:
United States District Judge Stephen S. Chandler here asks for
a stay of an "Order" of the Judicial Council of the Tenth Circuit
directing that until further order of the Council, Judge Chandler
"take no action whatsoever in any case or proceeding now or here-
after pending" in his court, that cases now assigned to him be
assigned to other judges, and that no new actions filed be assigned
to him. If this order is not stayed and if the Judicial Council
has some way to enforce it, the order means that Judge Chandler
is completely barred from performing any of his official duties
and in effect is removed or ousted from office pending further
orders of the Council. The reason given by the Council for this
drastic action is that it "finds that Judge Chandler is presently
unable, or unwilling to discharge efficiently the duties of his
200-278-66-45
し

FRIDAY, JANUARY 21, 1966
206
office..." By refusing to stay the Council's order, the Court
necessarily acts on the premise that the Council has a legal right
to remove Judge Chandler from office at least temporarily.
Though the Court tries to soft-pedal its refusal to stay the order
by referring to it as "interlocutory in character," the stark fact
which cannot be disguised is that a United States District Judge,
duly appointed by the President and approved by the Senate, is
with this Court's imprimatur locked out of his office pending
"further proceedings" by the Judicial Council. I think the
Council is completely without legal authority to issue any such
order, either temporary or permanent, with or without a hearing,
that no statute purports to authorize it, and that the Constitution
forbids it. Nor can the effect of the order be softened by asserting
that Judge Chandler will be permitted to have a lawyer represent
him before his fellow judges. Assuming that we have jurisdiction
to stay an order from a governmental agency that has no power
at all to do what this Council has done, I would stay this "Order"
instanter.
The Council states that its order was made "pursuant to the
power and authority vested in the Judicial Council by the Act
of June 25, 1948, p. 646, § 332, 62 Stat. 902, 28 U. S. C. § 332."
That section so far as relevant reads:
"Each judicial council shall make all necessary orders for
the effective and expeditious administration of the business.
of the courts within its circuit. The district courts shall
promptly carry into effect all orders of the judicial council."
There is no language whatever in this or any other Act which can
by any reasonable interpretation be read as giving the Council a
power to pass upon the work of district judges, declare them
inefficient and strip them of their power to act as judges. The
language of Congress indicates a purpose to vest the Judicial
Council with limited administrative powers; nothing in this lan-
guage, or the history behind it, indicates that a Council of Circuit
Court Judges was to be vested with power to discipline district
judges, and in effect remove them from office. This is clearly and
simply a proceeding by circuit judges to inquire into the fitness
of a district judge to hold his office and to remove him if they
so desire. I do not believe Congress could, even if it wished, vest
any such power in the circuit judges.
One of the great advances made in the structure of government
by our Constitution was its provision for an independent judici-
ary-for judges who could do their duty as they saw it without
having to account to superior court judges or to any one else
except the Senate sitting as a court of impeachment. Article II,
}
'

FRIDAY, JANUARY 21, 1966
207
§4 of the Constitution provides that "Officers of the United
States," which include judges, "shall be removed from Office on
Impeachment for, and Conviction of Treason, Bribery, or other
high Crimes and Misdemeanors," and Art. I, §§ 2 and 3 state
that impeachment can be instituted only on recommendation of
the House of Representatives and that trial can be held only by
the Senate. To hold that judges can do what this Judicial Council
has tried to do to Judge Chandler here would in my judgment.
violate the plan of our Constitution to preserve, as far as possi-
ble, the liberty of the people by guaranteeing that they have
judges wholly independent of the Government or any of its agents
with the exception of the United States Congress acting under
its limited power of impeachment. We should stop in its infancy,
before it has any growth at all, this idea that the United States
district judges can be made accountable for their efficiency or lack
of it to the judges just over them in the federal judicial system.
The only way to do that is to grant this stay and I am in favor
of granting it.

by including therein Rules 23.1, 23.2, 44.1 and 65.1,
Supplemental Rules A, B, C, D, E and F for Certain

262

'
AMENDMENTS TO RULES OF CIVIL
PROCEDURE
FOR THE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURTS
RULE 1. SCOPE OF RULES
These rules govern the procedure in the United States
district courts in all suits of a civil nature whether cog-
nizable as cases at law or in equity or in admiralty, with·
the exceptions stated in Rule 81. They shall be con-
strued to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive
determination of every action.
RULE 4. PROCESS
(f) TERRITORIAL LIMITS OF EFFECTIVE SERVICE. All
process other than a subpoena may be served anywhere
within the territorial limits of the state in which the
district court is held, and, when authorized by a statute
of the United States or by these rules, beyond the terri-
torial limits of that state. In addition, persons who are
brought in as parties pursuant to Rule 14, or as addi-
tional parties to a pending action or a counterclaim or
cross-claim therein pursuant to Rule 19, may be served
in the manner stated in paragraphs (1)-(6) of subdi-
vision (d) of this rule at all places outside the state but
within the United States that are not more than 100
miles from the place in which the action is commenced,
or to which it is assigned or transferred for trial; and
persons required to respond to an order of commitment
for civil contempt may be served at the same places. A
subpoena may be served within the territorial limits
provided in Rule 45.

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
264
RULE 8. GENERAL RULES OF PLEADING
(e) PLEADING TO BE CONCISE AND DIRECT; CONSIST-
ENCY.
(2) A party may set forth two or more statements
of a claim or defense alternately or hypothetically,
either in one count or defense or in separate counts
or defenses. When two or more statements are
made in the alternative and one of them if made
independently would be sufficient, the pleading is
not made insufficient by the insufficiency of one or
more of the alternative statements. A party may
also state as many separate claims or defenses as he
has regardless of consistency and whether based on
legal, equitable, or maritime grounds. All state-
ments shall be made subject to the obligations set
forth in Rule 11.
RULE 9. PLEADING SPECIAL MATTERS
(h) ADMIRALTY AND MARITIME CLAIMS. A pleading
or count setting forth a claim for relief within the ad-
miralty and maritime jurisdiction that is also within the
jurisdiction of the district court on some other ground
may contain a statement identifying the claim as an
admiralty or maritime claim for the purposes of Rules
14 (c), 26 (a), 38 (e), 73 (h), 82, and the Supplemental
Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims. If
the claim is cognizable only in admiralty it is an ad-
miralty or maritime claim for those purposes whether
so identified or not. The amendment of a pleading to
add or withdraw an identifying statement is governed by
the principles of Rule 15.
RULE 12. DEFENSES AND OBJECTIONS-WHEN AND HOW
PRESENTED BY PLEADING OR MOTION-MOTION
FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS
(b) How PRESENTED. Every defense, in law or fact,
to a claim for relief in any pleading, whether a claim,

1
RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
265
counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, shall be
asserted in the responsive pleading thereto if one is re-
quired, except that the following defenses may at the
option of the pleader be made by motion: (1) lack of
jurisdiction over the subject matter, (2) lack of juris-
diction over the person, (3) improper venue, (4) insuffi-
ciency of process, (5) insufficiency of service of process,
(6) failure to state a claim upon which relief can be
granted, (7) failure to join a party under Rule 19. A
motion making any of these defenses shall be made before
pleading if a further pleading is permitted. No defense
or objection is waived by being joined with one or more
other defenses or objections in a responsive pleading or
motion. If a pleading sets forth a claim for relief to
which the adverse party is not required to serve a respon-
sive pleading, he may assert at the trial any defense in
law or fact to that claim for relief. If, on a motion
asserting the defense numbered (6) to dismiss for failure
of the pleading to state a claim upon which relief can
be granted, matters outside the pleading are presented
to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be
treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of
as provided in Rule 56, and all parties shall be given
reasonable opportunity to present all material made
pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.
(g) CONSOLIDATION OF DEFENSES IN MOTION. A
party who makes a motion under this rule may join with
it any other motions herein provided for and then avail-
able to him. If a party makes a motion under this rule
but omits therefrom any defense or objection then avail-
able to him which this rule permits to be raised by mo-
tion, he shall not thereafter make a motion based on the
defense or objection so omitted, except a motion as pro-
vided in subdivision (h) (2) hereof on any of the grounds.
there stated.
(h) WAIVER OR PRESERVATION OF CERTAIN DEFENSES.
(1) A defense of lack of jurisdiction over the per-
son, improper venue, insufficiency of process, or
भ
די

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
266
insufficiency of service of process is waived (A) if
omitted from a motion in the circumstances de-
scribed in subdivision (g), or (B) if it is neither
made by motion under this rule nor included in a
responsive pleading or an amendment thereof per-
mitted by Rule 15 (a) to be made as a matter of
course.
(2) A defense of failure to state a claim upon
which relief can be granted, a defense of failure to
join a party indispensable under Rule 19, and an
objection of failure to state a legal defense to a
claim may be made in any pleading permitted or
ordered under Rule 7 (a), or by motion for judg-
ment on the pleadings, or at the trial on the merits.
(3) Whenever it appears by suggestion of the
parties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction
of the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the
action.
RULE 13. COUNTERCLAIM AND CROSS-CLAIM
(h) JOINDER OF ADDITIONAL PARTIES. Persons other
than those made parties to the original action may be
made parties to a counterclaim or cross-claim in accord-
ance with the provisions of Rules 19 and 20.
RULE 14. THIRD-PARTY PRACTICE
(a) WHEN DEFENDANT MAY BRING IN THIRD PARTY.
At any time after commencement of the action a defend-
ing party, as a third-party plaintiff, may cause a sum-
mons and complaint to be served upon a person not a
party to the action who is or may be liable to him for
all or part of the plaintiff's claim against him. The
third-party plaintiff need not obtain leave to make the
service if he files the third-party complaint not later than
10 days after he serves his original answer. Otherwise
he must obtain leave on motion upon notice to all parties
to the action. The person served with the summons and
third-party complaint, hereinafter called the third-party
1

1
RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
267
defendant, shall make his defenses to the third-party
plaintiff's claim as provided in Rule 12 and his counter-
claims against the third-party plaintiff and cross-claims
against other third-party defendants as provided in Rule
13. The third-party defendant may assert against the
plaintiff any defenses which the third-party plaintiff has
to the plaintiff's claim. The third-party defendant may
also assert any claim against the plaintiff arising out of
the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter
of the plaintiff's claim against the third-party plaintiff.
The plaintiff may assert any claim against the third-
party defendant arising out of the transaction or occur-
rence that is the subject matter of the plaintiff's claim
against the third-party plaintiff, and the third-party
defendant thereupon shall assert his defenses as provided
in Rule 12 and his counterclaims and cross-claims as pro-
vided in Rule 13. Any party may move to strike the
third-party claim, or for its severance or separate trial.
A third-party defendant may proceed under this rule
against any person not a party to the action who is or
may be liable to him for all or part of the claim made
in the action against the third-party defendant. The
third-party complaint, if within the admiralty and mari-
time jurisdiction, may be in rem against a vessel, cargo,
or other property subject to admiralty or maritime proc-
ess in rem, in which case references in this rule to the
summons include the warrant of arrest, and references
to the third-party plaintiff or defendant include, where
appropriate, the claimant of the property arrested.
(c) ADMIRALTY AND MARITIME CLAIMS. When a
plaintiff asserts an admiralty or maritime claim within
the meaning of Rule 9 (h), the defendant or claimant,
as a third-party plaintiff, may bring in a third-party
defendant who may be wholly or partly liable, either to
the plaintiff or to the third-party plaintiff, by way of
remedy over, contribution, or otherwise on account of
the same transaction, occurrence, or series of transactions
or occurrences. In such a case the third-party plaintiff
1

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
268
may also demand judgment against the third-party de-
fendant in favor of the plaintiff, in which event the third-
party defendant shall make his defenses to the claim of
the plaintiff as well as to that of the third-party plaintiff
in the manner provided in Rule 12 and the action shall
proceed as if the plaintiff had commenced it against the
third-party defendant as well as the third-party plaintiff.
RULE 15. AMENDED AND SUPPLEMENTAL PLEADINGS
(c) RELATION BACK OF AMENDMENTS. Whenever the
claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose
out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or
attempted to be set forth in the original pleading, the
amendment relates back to the date of the original plead-
ing. An amendment changing the party against whom
a claim is asserted relates back if the foregoing provision
is satisfied and, within the period provided by law for
commencing the action against him, the party to be
brought in by amendment (1) has received such notice
of the institution of the action that he will not be preju-.
diced in maintaining his defense on the merits, and
(2) knew or should have known that, but for a mistake
concerning the identity of the proper party, the action
would have been brought against him.
The delivery or mailing of process to the United States
attorney, or his designee, or the Attorney General of the
United States, or an agency or officer who would have
been a proper defendant if named, satisfies the require-
ment of clauses (1) and (2) hereof with respect to the
United States or any agency or officer thereof to be
brought into the action as a defendant.
RULE 17. PARTIES PLAINTIFF AND DEFENDANT;
CAPACITY
(a) REAL PARTY IN INTEREST. Every action shall be
prosecuted in the name of the real party in interest. An
executor, administrator, guardian, bailee, trustee of an
express trust, a party with whom or in whose name a

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
269
contract has been made for the benefit of another, or a
party authorized by statute may sue in his own name
without joining with him the party for whose benefit the
action is brought; and when a statute of the United
States so provides, an action for the use or benefit of
another shall be brought in the name of the United
States. No action shall be dismissed on the ground that
it is not prosecuted in the name of the real party in
interest until a reasonable time has been allowed after
objection for ratification of commencement of the action
by, or joinder or substitution of, the real party in inter-
est; and such ratification, joinder, or substitution shall
have the same effect as if the action had been commenced
in the name of the real party in interest.
RULE 18. JOINDER OF CLAIMS AND REMEDIES
(a) JOINDER OF CLAIMS. A party asserting a claim to
relief as an original claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or
third-party claim, may join, either as independent or as
alternate claims, as many claims, legal, equitable, or
maritime, as he has against an opposing party.
RULE 19. JOINDER OF PERSONS NEEDED FOR JUST
ADJUDICATION
(a) PERSONS TO BE JOINED IF FEASIBLE. A person
who is subject to service of process and whose joinder
will not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the subject
matter of the action shall be joined as a party in the
action if (1) in his absence complete relief cannot be
accorded among those already parties, or (2) he claims
an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so
situated that the disposition of the action in his absence
may (i) as a practical matter impair or impede his ability
to protect that interest or (ii) leave any of the persons
already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring
double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations by
reason of his claimed interest. If he has not been so
joined, the court shall order that he be made a party.
200-278 0-66-60

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
270
If he should join as a plaintiff but refuses to do so, he
may be made a defendant, or, in a proper case, an invol-
untary plaintiff. If the joined party objects to venue.
and his joinder would render the venue of the action
improper, he shall be dismissed from the action.
(b) DETERMINATION BY COURT WHENEVER JOINDER
NOT FEASIBLE. If a person as described in subdivision
(a) (1)-(2) hereof cannot be made a party, the court
shall determine whether in equity and good conscience
the action should proceed among the parties before it,
or should be dismissed, the absent person being thus
regarded as indispensable. The factors to be considered
by the court include: first, to what extent a judgment
rendered in the person's absence might be prejudicial to
him or those already parties; second, the extent to which,
by protective provisions in the judgment, by the shaping
of relief, or other measures, the prejudice can be lessened
or avoided; third, whether a judgment rendered in the
person's absence will be adequate; fourth, whether the
plaintiff will have an adequate remedy if the action is
dismissed for nonjoinder.
(c) PLEADING REASONS FOR NONJOINDER. A pleading
asserting a claim for relief shall state the names, if known.
to the pleader, of any persons as described in subdivision
(a)(1)-(2) hereof who are not joined, and the reasons
why they are not joined.
(d) EXCEPTION OF CLASS ACTIONS. This rule is sub-
ject to the provisions of Rule 23.
RULE 20. PERMISSIVE JOINDER OF PARTIES
(a) PERMISSIVE JOINDER. All persons may join in
one action as plaintiffs if they assert any right to relief
jointly, severally, or in the alternative in respect of or
arising out of the same transaction, occurrence, or series
of transactions or occurrences and if any question of law
or fact common to all these persons will arise in the
action. All persons (and any vessel, cargo or other prop-
erty subject to admiralty process in rem) may be joined

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
271
in one action as defendants if there is asserted against
them jointly, severally, or in the alternative, any right.
to relief in respect of or arising out of the same trans-
action, occurrence, or series of transactions or occurrences
and if any question of law or fact common to all defend-
ants will arise in the action. A plaintiff or defendant
need not be interested in obtaining or defending against
all the relief demanded. Judgment may be given for
one or more of the plaintiffs according to their respective
rights to relief, and against one or more defendants
according to their respective liabilities.
**
RULE 23. CLASS ACTIONS
(a) PREREQUISITES TO A CLASS ACTION. One or more
members of a class may sue or be sued as representative
parties on behalf of all only if (1) the class is so numer-
ous that joinder of all members is impracticable, (2) there
are questions of law or fact common to the class,
(3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties
are typical of the claims or defenses of the class, and
(4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately
protect the interests of the class.
(b) CLASS ACTIONS MAINTAINABLE. An action may
be maintained as a class action if the prerequisites of
subdivision (a) are satisfied, and in addition:
(1) the prosecution of separate actions by or
against individual members of the class would create
a risk of
(A) inconsistent or varying adjudications
with respect to individual members of the class
which would establish incompatible standards
of conduct for the party opposing the class, or
(B) adjudications with respect to individual
members of the class which would as a practi-
cal matter be dispositive of the interests of the
other members not parties to the adjudications
or substantially impair or impede their ability
to protect their interests; or
h

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
272
(2) the party opposing the class has acted or
refused to act on grounds generally applicable to
the class, thereby making appropriate final injunc-
tive relief or corresponding declaratory relief with
respect to the class as a whole; or
(3) the court finds that the questions of law or
fact common to the members of the class predomi-
nate over any questions affecting only individual
members, and that a class action is superior to other
available methods for the fair and efficient adjudi-
cation of the controversy. The matters pertinent to
the findings include: (A) the interest of members of
the class in individually controlling the prosecution
or defense of separate actions%; (B) the extent and
nature of any litigation concerning the controversy
already commenced by or against members of the
class; (C) the desirability or undesirability of con-
centrating the litigation of the claims in the par-
ticular forum; (D) the difficulties likely to be
encountered in the management of a class action.
(c) DETERMINATION BY ORDER WHETHER CLASS AC-
TION TO BE MAINTAINED; NOTICE; JUDGMENT; ACTIONS
CONDUCTED PARTIALLY AS CLASS ACTIONS.
(1) As soon as practicable after the commence-
ment of an action brought as a class action, the court
shall determine by order whether it is to be so main-
tained. An order under this subdivision may be
conditional, and may be altered or amended before
the decision on the merits.
(2) In any class action maintained under sub-
division (b)(3), the court shall direct to the mem-
bers of the class the best notice practicable under
the circumstances, including individual notice to all
members who can be identified through reasonable
effort. The notice shall advise each member that
(A) the court will exclude him from the class if he
so requests by a specified date; (B) the judgment,

+
RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
273
whether favorable or not, will include all members.
who do not request exclusion; and (C) any member
who does not request exclusion may, if he desires,
enter an appearance through his counsel.
(3) The judgment in an action maintained as a
class action under subdivision (b) (1) or (b)(2),
whether or not favorable to the class, shall include
and describe those whom the court finds to be mem-
bers of the class. The judgment in an action main-
tained as a class action under subdivision (b)(3),
whether or not favorable to the class, shall include
and specify or describe those to whom the notice
provided in subdivision (c) (2) was directed, and
who have not requested exclusion, and whom the
court finds to be members of the class.
(4) When appropriate (A) an action may be
brought or maintained as a class action with respect
to particular issues, or (B) a class may be divided
into subclasses and each subclass treated as a class,
and the provisions of this rule shall then be con-
strued and applied accordingly.
(d) ORDERS IN CONDUCT OF ACTIONS. In the conduct
of actions to which this rule applies, the court may make
appropriate orders: (1) determining the course of pro-
ceedings or prescribing measures to prevent undue repe-
tition or complication in the presentation of evidence or
argument; (2) requiring, for the protection of the mem-
bers of the class or otherwise for the fair conduct of the
action, that notice be given in such manner as the court
may direct to some or all of the members of any step in
the action, or of the proposed extent of the judgment, or
of the opportunity of members to signify whether they
consider the representation fair and adequate, to inter-
vene and present claims or defenses, or otherwise to come
into the action; (3) imposing conditions on the repre-
sentative parties or on intervenors; (4) requiring that
the pleadings be amended to eliminate therefrom allega-
W

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
274
tions as to representation of absent persons, and that the
action proceed accordingly; (5) dealing with similar pro-
cedural matters. The orders may be combined with an
order under Rule 16, and may be altered or amended as
may be desirable from time to time.
(e) DISMISSAL OR COMPROMISE. A class action shall
not be dismissed or compromised without the approval
of the court, and notice of the proposed dismissal or com-
promise shall be given to all members of the class in such
manner as the court directs.
RULE 23.1. DERIVATIVE ACTIONS BY SHAREHOLDERS
In a derivative action brought by one or more share-
holders or members to enforce a right of a corporation or
of an unincorporated association, the corporation or asso-
ciation having failed to enforce a right which may prop-
erly be asserted by it, the complaint shall be verified and
shall allege (1) that the plaintiff was a shareholder or
member at the time of the transaction of which he com-
plains or that his share or membership thereafter de-
volved on him by operation of law, and (2) that the
action is not a collusive one to confer jurisdiction on a
court of the United States which it would not otherwise
have. The complaint shall also allege with particularity
the efforts, if any, made by the plaintiff to obtain the
action he desires from the directors or comparable author-
ity and, if necessary, from the shareholders or members,
and the reasons for his failure to obtain the action or for
not making the effort. The derivative action may not
be maintained if it appears that the plaintiff does not
fairly and adequately represent the interests of the share-
holders or members similarly situated in enforcing the
right of the corporation or association. The action shall
not be dismissed or compromised without the approval of
the court, and notice of the proposed dismissal or com-
promise shall be given to shareholders or members in
such manner as the court directs.

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
RULE 23.2. ACTIONS RELATING TO UNINCORPO-
RATED ASSOCIATIONS
275
An action brought by or against the members of an
unincorporated association as a class by naming certain
members as representative parties may be maintained
only if it appears that the representative parties will
fairly and adequately protect the interests of the asso-
ciation and its members. In the conduct of the action
the court may make appropriate orders corresponding
with those described in Rule 23 (d), and the procedure
for dismissal or compromise of the action shall correspond
with that provided in Rule 23 (e).
RULE 24. INTERVENTION
(a) INTERVENTION OF RIGHT. Upon timely applica-
tion anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action:
(1) when a statute of the United States confers an
unconditional right to intervene; or (2) when the appli-
cant claims an interest relating to the property or trans-
action which is the subject of the action and he is so
situated that the disposition of the action may as a prac-
tical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that
interest, unless the applicant's interest is adequately
represented by existing parties.
RULE 26. DEPOSITIONS PENDING ACTION
(a) WHEN DEPOSITIONS MAY BE TAKEN. Any party
may take the testimony of any person, including a party,
by deposition upon oral examination or written interrog-
atories for the purpose of discovery or for use as evidence
in the action or for both purposes. After commencement
of the action the deposition may be taken without leave
of court, except that leave, granted with or without
notice, must be obtained if notice of the taking is served.
by the plaintiff within 20 days after commencement of
the action. The attendance of witnesses may be com-
pelled by the use of subpoena as provided in Rule 45.
"

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
276
Depositions shall be taken only in accordance with these
rules, except that in admiralty and maritime claims
within the meaning of Rule 9 (h) depositions may also
be taken under and used in accordance with sections 863,
864, and 865 of the Revised Statutes (see note preceding
28 U. S. C. § 1781). The deposition of a person confined
in prison may be taken only by leave of court on such
terms as the court prescribes.
RULE 38. JURY TRIAL OF RIGHT
(e) ADMIRALTY AND MARITIME CLAIMS. These rules
shall not be construed to create a right to trial by jury
of the issues in an admiralty or maritime claim within
the meaning of Rule 9 (h).
RULE 41. DISMISSAL OF ACTIONS
(b) INVOLUNTARY DISMISSAL: EFFECT THEREOF. For
failure of the plaintiff to prosecute or to comply with
these rules or any order of court, a defendant may move
for dismissal of an action or of any claim against him.
After the plaintiff, in an action tried by the court with-
out a jury, has completed the presentation of his evi-
dence, the defendant, without waiving his right to offer
evidence in the event the motion is not granted, may
move for a dismissal on the ground that upon the facts
and the law the plaintiff has shown no right to relief.
The court as trier of the facts may then determine them
and render judgment against the plaintiff or may decline
to render any judgment until the close of all the evidence.
If the court renders judgment on the merits against the
plaintiff, the court shall make findings as provided in
Rule 52 (a). Unless the court in its order for dismissal
otherwise specifies, a dismissal under this subdivision and
any dismissal not provided for in this rule, other than a
dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, for improper venue, or
for failure to join a party under Rule 19, operates as an
adjudication upon the merits.

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
RULE 42. CONSOLIDATION; SEPARATE TRIALS
277
(b) SEPARATE TRIALS. The court, in furtherance of
convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials
will be conducive to expedition and economy, may order
a separate trial of any claim, cross-claim, counterclaim,
or third-party claim, or of any separate issue or of any
number of claims, cross-claims, counterclaims, third-
party claims, or issues, always preserving inviolate the
right of trial by jury as declared by the Seventh Amend-
ment to the Constitution or as given by a statute of the
United States.
RULE 43. EVIDENCE
(f) INTERPRETERS. The court may appoint an inter-
preter of its own selection and may fix his reasonable
compensation. The compensation shall be paid out of
funds provided by law or by one or more of the parties as
the court may direct, and may be taxed ultimately as
costs, in the discretion of the court.
RULE 44. PROOF OF OFFICIAL RECORD
(a) AUTHENTICATION.
(1) DOMESTIC. An official record kept within
the United States, or any state, district, common-
wealth, territory, or insular possession thereof, or
within the Panama Canal Zone, the Trust Territory
of the Pacific Islands, or the Ryukyu Islands, or
an entry therein, when admissible for any purpose,
may be evidenced by an official publication thereof
or by a copy attested by the officer having the legal
custody of the record, or by his deputy, and accom-
panied by a certificate that such officer has the cus-
tody. The certificate may be made by a judge of a
court of record of the district or political subdivision
in which the record is kept, authenticated by the
seal of the court, or may be made by any public
officer having a seal of office and having official
1
200-278 0-66--61

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
278
duties in the district or political subdivision in which
the record is kept, authenticated by the seal of his
office.
(2) FOREIGN. A foreign official record, or an
entry therein, when admissible for any purpose, may
be evidenced by an official publication thereof; or a
copy thereof, attested by a person authorized to
make the attestation, and accompanied by a final
certification as to the genuineness of the signature
and official position (i) of the attesting person, or
(ii) of any foreign official whose certificate of gen-
uineness of signature and official position relates to
the attestation or is in a chain of certificates of
genuineness of signature and official position relat-
ing to the attestation. A final certification may be
made by a secretary of embassy or legation, consul
general, consul, vice consul, or consular agent of the
United States, or a diplomatic or consular official of
the foreign country assigned or accredited to the
United States. If reasonable opportunity has been
given to all parties to investigate the authenticity
and accuracy of the documents, the court may, for
good cause shown, (i) admit an attested copy with-
out final certification or (ii) permit the foreign
official record to be evidenced by an attested sum-
mary with or without a final certification.
(b) LACK OF RECORD. A written statement that after
diligent search no record or entry of a specified tenor is
found to exist in the records designated by the statement,
authenticated as provided in subdivision (a)(1) of this
rule in the case of a domestic record, or complying with
the requirements of subdivision (a)(2) of this rule for a
summary in the case of a foreign record, is admissible as
evidence that the records contain no such record or entry.
(c) OTHER PROOF. This rule does not prevent the
proof of official records or of entry or lack of entry
therein by any other method authorized by law.

1
RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
RULE 44.1. DETERMINATION OF FOREIGN LAW
279
A party who intends to raise an issue concerning the
law of a foreign country shall give notice in his pleadings
or other reasonable written notice. The court, in deter-
mining foreign law, may consider any relevant material
or source, including testimony, whether or not submitted
by a party or admissible under Rule 43. The court's
determination shall be treated as a ruling on a question
of law.
RULE 47. JURORS
(b) ALTERNATE JURORS. The court may direct that
not more than six jurors in addition to the regular jury
be called and impanelled to sit as alternate jurors. Alter-
nate jurors in the order in which they are called shall
replace jurors who, prior to the time the jury retires to
consider its verdict, become or are found to be unable or
disqualified to perform their duties. Alternate jurors
shall be drawn in the same manner, shall have the same
qualifications, shall be subject to the same examination
and challenges, shall take the same oath, and shall have
the same functions, powers, facilities, and privileges as
the regular jurors. An alternate juror who does not
replace a regular juror shall be discharged after the jury
retires to consider its verdict. Each side is entitled to 1
peremptory challenge in addition to those otherwise
allowed by law if 1 or 2 alternate jurors are to be im-
panelled, 2 peremptory challenges if 3 or 4 alternate
jurors are to be impanelled, and 3 peremptory challenges
if 5 or 6 alternate jurors are to be impanelled. The addi-
tional peremptory challenges may be used against an
alternate juror only, and the other peremptory challenges
allowed by law shall not be used against an alternate
juror.
RULE 53. MASTERS
(a) APPOINTMENT AND COMPENSATION. Each district
court with the concurrence of a majority of all the judges

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
280
thereof may appoint one or more standing masters for
its district, and the court in which any action is pending
may appoint a special master therein. As used in these
rules the word "master" includes a referee, an auditor,
an examiner, a commissioner, and an assessor. The com-
pensation to be allowed to a master shall be fixed by the
court, and shall be charged upon such of the parties or
paid out of any fund or subject matter of the action,
which is in the custody and control of the court as the
court may direct. The master shall not retain his report
as security for his compensation; but when the party
ordered to pay the compensation allowed by the court
does not pay it after notice and within the time pre-
scribed by the court, the master is entitled to a writ of
execution against the delinquent party.
(b) REFERENCE. A reference to a master shall be the
exception and not the rule. In actions to be tried by a
jury, a reference shall be made only when the issues are
complicated; in actions to be tried without a jury, save
in matters of account and of difficult computation of
damages, a reference shall be made only upon a showing
that some exceptional condition requires it.
RULE 59. NEW TRIALS; AMENDMENT
OF JUDGMENTS
(d) ON INITIATIVE OF COURT. Not later than 10 days
after entry of judgment the court of its own initiative
may order a new trial for any reason for which it might
have granted a new trial on motion of a party. After
giving the parties notice and an opportunity to be heard
on the matter, the court may grant a motion for a new
trial, timely served, for a reason not stated in the motion.
In either case, the court shall specify in the order the
grounds therefor.
RULE 65. INJUNCTIONS
(a) PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION.
(1) NOTICE. No preliminary injunction shall be
issued without notice to the adverse party.

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
281
(2) CONSOLIDATION OF HEARING WITH TRIAL ON
MERITS. Before or after the commencement of the
hearing of an application for a preliminary injunc-
tion, the court may order the trial of the action on
the merits to be advanced and consolidated with the
hearing of the application. Even when this consoli-
dation is not ordered, any evidence received upon an
application for a preliminary injunction which would
be admissible upon the trial on the merits becomes
part of the record on the trial and need not be
repeated upon the trial. This subdivision (a)(2)
shall be so construed and applied as to save to the
parties any rights they may have to trial by jury.
(b) TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER; NOTICE; HEAR-
ING; DURATION. A temporary restraining order may be
granted without written or oral notice to the adverse
party or his attorney only if (1) it clearly appears from
specific facts shown by affidavit or by the verified com-
plaint that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or
damage will result to the applicant before the adverse
party or his attorney can be heard in opposition, and
(2) the applicant's attorney certifies to the court in
writing the efforts, if any, which have been made to give
the notice and the reasons supporting his claim that
notice should not be required. Every temporary re-
straining order granted without notice shall be indorsed
with the date and hour of issuance; shall be filed forth-
with in the clerk's office and entered of record; shall de-
fine the injury and state why it is irreparable and why
the order was granted without notice; and shall expire by
its terms within such time after entry, not to exceed 10
days, as the court fixes, unless within the time so fixed
the order, for good cause shown, is extended for a like
period or unless the party against whom the order is
directed consents that it may be extended for a longer
period. The reasons for the extension shall be entered
of record. In case a temporary restraining order is
granted without notice, the motion for a preliminary
5

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
282
injunction shall be set down for hearing at the earliest
possible time and takes precedence of all matters except
older matters of the same character; and when the
motion comes on for hearing the party who obtained the
temporary restraining order shall proceed with the appli-
cation for a preliminary injunction and, if he does not
do so, the court shall dissolve the temporary restraining
order. On 2 days' notice to the party who obtained the
temporary restraining order without notice or on such
shorter notice to that party as the court may prescribe,
the adverse party may appear and move its dissolution
or modification and in that event the court shall proceed
to hear and determine such motion as expeditiously as
the ends of justice require.
(c) SECURITY. No restraining order or preliminary
injunction shall issue except upon the giving of security
by the applicant, in such sum as the court deems proper,
for the payment of such costs and damages as may be
incurred or suffered by any party who is found to have
been wrongfully enjoined or restrained. No such secu-
rity shall be required of the United States or of an officer
or agency thereof.
The provisions of Rule 65.1 apply to a surety upon a
bond or undertaking under this rule.
RULE 65.1. SECURITY: PROCEEDINGS AGAINST
SURETIES
Whenever these rules, including the Supplemental
Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims, re-
quire or permit the giving of security by a party, and
security is given in the form of a bond or stipulation or
other undertaking with one or more sureties, each surety
submits himself to the jurisdiction of the court and irrev-
ocably appoints the clerk of the court as his agent upon
whom any papers affecting his liability on the bond or
undertaking may be served. His liability may be en-
forced on motion without the necessity of an independ-
ent action. The motion and such notice of the motion
વ

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
283
as the court prescribes may be served on the clerk of
the court, who shall forthwith mail copies to the sureties
if their addresses are known.
RULE 68. OFFER OF JUDGMENT
At any time more than 10 days before the trial begins,
a party defending against a claim may serve upon the
adverse party an offer to allow judgment to be taken
against him for the money or property or to the effect
specified in his offer, with costs then accrued. If within
10 days after the service of the offer the adverse party
serves written notice that the offer is accepted, either
party may then file the offer and notice of acceptance
together with proof of service thereof and thereupon
the clerk shall enter judgment. An offer not accepted
shall be deemed withdrawn and evidence thereof is not
admissible except in a proceeding to determine costs.
If the judgment finally obtained by the offeree is not
more favorable than the offer, the offeree must pay the
costs incurred after the making of the offer. The fact
that an offer is made but not accepted does not preclude
a subsequent offer. When the liability of one party to
another has been determined by verdict or order or judg-
ment, but the amount or extent of the liability remains
to be determined by further proceedings, the party ad-
judged liable may make an offer of judgment, which
shall have the same effect as an offer made before trial
if it is served within a reasonable time not less than 10
days prior to the commencement of hearings to determine
the amount or extent of liability.
RULE 73. APPEAL TO A COURT OF APPEALS
(a) How AND WHEN TAKEN. An appeal permitted
by law from a district court to a court of appeals shall
be taken by filing a notice of appeal with the district
court within 30 days from the entry of the judgment
appealed from, except that: (1) in any action in which
the United States or an officer or agency thereof is a

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
284
party, the notice of appeal may be filed by any party
within 60 days from such entry; (2) upon a showing of
excusable neglect the district court in any action may
extend the time for filing the notice of appeal not exceed-
ing 30 days from the expiration of the original time
herein prescribed; (3) if a timely notice of appeal is
filed by a party, any other party may file a notice of
appeal within 14 days of the date on which the first
notice of appeal was filed, or within the time otherwise
herein prescribed, whichever period last expires; (4) an
appeal by permission of a court of appeals obtained
under Title 28, U. S. C., § 1292 (b) shall be taken in
accordance with the rules of the court of appeals. The
running of the time for appeal is terminated as to all
parties by a timely motion made by any party pursuant
to any of the rules hereinafter enumerated, and the full
time for appeal fixed in this subdivision commences to
run and is to be computed from the entry of any of the
following orders made upon a timely motion under such
rules: granting or denying a motion for judgment under
Rule 50 (b); or granting or denying a motion under Rule
52 (b) to amend or make additional findings of fact,
whether or not an alteration of the judgment would be
required if the motion is granted; or granting or denying
a motion under Rule 59 to alter or amend the judgment;
or denying a motion for a new trial under Rule 59.
Failure of an appellant to take any step other than
the timely filing of a notice of appeal does not affect the
validity of the appeal, but is ground only for such action
as the court of appeals deems appropriate, which may
include dismissal of the appeal. If an appeal has not
been docketed, the parties, with the approval of the dis-
trict court, may dismiss the appeal by stipulation, filed
in that court, or that court may dismiss the appeal upon
motion and notice by the appellant.
(b) NOTICE OF APPEAL. The notice of appeal shall
specify the parties taking the appeal; shall designate
the judgment or part thereof appealed from; and shall

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
285
name the court to which the appeal is taken. The clerk
shall serve notice of the filing of the notice of appeal by
mailing a copy thereof to the attorney of record of each
party other than the appellant, or, if a party is not rep-
resented by an attorney, then to the party at his last
known address, but his failure to do so does not affect
the validity of the appeal, and such notification is suffi-
cient notwithstanding the death of the party or of his
attorney prior to the giving of the notification. The
clerk shall note on each copy thus served the date on
which the notice of appeal was filed, and shall note in
the civil docket the names of the parties to whom he
mails the copies, with date of mailing.
(c) BOND ON APPEAL. Unless an appellant is ex-
empted by law, or has filed a supersedeas bond or other
undertaking which includes security for the payment of
costs on appeal, he shall file a bond for such costs or de-
posit equivalent security therefor with the notice of
appeal, but security shall not be required of an appellant
who is not subject to costs. The bond or equivalent
security shall be in the sum of two hundred and fifty
dollars, unless the court fixes a different amount. The
bond on appeal shall have sufficient surety and shall be
conditioned to secure the payment of costs if the appeal
is dismissed or the judgment affirmed, or of such costs
as the court of appeals may award if the judgment is
modified. If a bond on appeal or equivalent security
in the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars is given, no
approval thereof is necessary. After a bond on appeal
is filed an appellee may raise objections to the form of
the bond or to the sufficiency of the surety for determi-
nation by the clerk.
(d) SUPERSEDEAS BOND. Whenever an appellant en-
titled thereto desires a stay on appeal, he may present.
to the court for its approval a supersedeas bond which
shall have such surety or sureties as the court requires.
The bond shall be conditioned for the satisfaction of the
judgment in full together with costs, interest, and dam-
1
200-278 0-66--62

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
286
ages for delay, if for any reason the appeal is dismissed
or if the judgment is affirmed, and to satisfy in full such
modification of the judgment and such costs, interest,
and damages as the appellate court may adjudge and
award. When the judgment is for the recovery of
money not otherwise secured, the amount of the bond
shall be fixed at such sum as will cover the whole amount
of the judgment remaining unsatisfied, costs on the
appeal, interest, and damages for delay, unless the court
after notice and hearing and for good cause shown fixes
a different amount or orders security other than the bond.
When the judgment determines the disposition of the
property in controversy as in real actions, replevin, and
actions to foreclose mortgages or when such property is
in the custody of the marshal or when the proceeds of
such property or a bond for its value is in the custody or
control of the court, the amount of the supersedeas bond
shall be fixed at such sum only as will secure the amount
recovered for the use and detention of the property, the
costs of the action, costs on appeal, interest, and dam-
ages for delay. A separate supersedeas bond need not
be given, unless otherwise ordered, when the appellant
has already filed in the district court security including
the event of appeal, except for the difference in amount,
if any.
(f) JUDGMENTS AGAINST SURETY. The provisions of
Rule 65.1 apply to a surety upon an appeal or supersedeas
bond given pursuant to subdivisions (c) and (d) of this
rule.
(g) DOCKETING THE APPEAL; FILING OF THE RECORD
ON APPEAL. The appellant shall cause the record on
appeal as provided for in Rules 75 and 76 to be filed
with the court of appeals and the appeal to be docketed
there within 40 days from the date of filing the notice of
appeal. The record will be filed and the appeal docketed
upon receipt by the clerk of the court of appeals, within
the 40 days herein provided or within such shorter or
longer period as the court may prescribe, of the record

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
287
on appeal and, unless the appellant is authorized to pro-
ceed without prepayment of fees, of the docket fee fixed
by the Judicial Conference of the United States. When
more than one appeal is taken from the same judgment
to the same court of appeals, the district court may pre-
scribe the time for filing and docketing, which in no
event shall be less than 40 days from the date of filing
the first notice of appeal. In all cases the district court
may extend the time for filing the record and docketing
the appeal upon motion of an appellant made within the
period for filing and docketing as originally prescribed or
as extended by a previous order, or upon its own motion
by order entered within such period; but the district
court shall not extend the time to a day more than 90
days from the date of filing the first notice of appeal.
The motion of an appellant for an extension shall show
that his inability to effect timely filing and docketing is
due to causes beyond his control or to circumstances
which may be deemed excusable neglect. The district
court or the court of appeals may require the record to
be filed and the appeal to be docketed at any time within
the time otherwise provided or fixed.
(h) INTERLOCUTORY APPEALS IN ADMIRALTY AND
MARITIME CASES. These rules do not affect the appeal-
ability of interlocutory judgments in admiralty cases.
pursuant to Title 28, U. S. C., § 1292 (a) (3). The ref-
erence in that statute to admiralty cases shall be con-
strued to mean admiralty and maritime claims within
the meaning of Rule 9 (h).
RULE 74. JOINT APPEALS TO THE SUPREME COURT
OR TO A COURT OF APPEALS
If two or more persons are entitled to appeal from a
judgment or order and their interests are such as to make
joinder practicable, they may file a joint notice of appeal,
or may join in appeal after filing separate notices of
appeal, and they may thereafter proceed on appeal as a
single appellant.

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
RULE 75. RECORD ON APPEAL TO A COURT OF
APPEALS
288
(a) COMPOSITION OF THE RECORD ON APPEAL. The
original papers and exhibits filed in the district court,
the transcript of proceedings, if any, and a certified copy
of the docket entries prepared by the clerk of the district
court shall constitute the record on appeal in all cases.
The parties may agree by written stipulation filed in the
district court that designated parts of the record need
not be transmitted to the court of appeals, in which
event the parts shall be retained in the district court
unless thereafter the court of appeals shall order or any
party shall request their transmission, but the parts thus
designated shall nevertheless be a part of the record on
appeal for all purposes.
(b) THE TRANSCRIPT OF PROCEEDINGS; DUTY OF
APPELLANT TO ORDER; NOTICE TO APPELLEE IF PARTIAL
TRANSCRIPT IS ORDERED. Within 10 days after filing
the notice of appeal the appellant shall order from the
reporter a transcript of such parts of the proceedings not
already on file as he deems necessary for inclusion in the
record. Unless the entire transcript is to be included,
the appellant shall, within the time above provided, file
and serve on the appellee a description of the parts of
the transcript which he intends to include in the record
and a statement of the issues he intends to present on
the appeal. If an appellant intends to urge on appeal
that a finding or conclusion is unsupported by the evi-
dence or contrary to the evidence, he shall include in the
record a transcript of all evidence relevant to such find-
ing or conclusion. If the appellee deems a transcript
of other parts of the proceedings to be necessary he shall,
within 10 days after the service of the statement of the
issues by the appellant, order such parts from the reporter
or procure an order from the district court requiring the
appellant to do so. At the time of ordering, a party
must make satisfactory arrangements with the reporter
for payment of the cost of the transcript.

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
289
(c) STATEMENT OF THE EVIDENCE OR PROCEEDINGS
WHEN NO REPORT WAS MADE OR WHEN THE TRAN-
SCRIPT IS UNAVAILABLE. If no report of the evidence or
proceedings at a hearing or trial was made, or if a tran-
script is unavailable, the appellant may prepare a state-
ment of the evidence or proceedings from the best avail-
able means, including his recollection. The statement
shall be served on the appellee, who may serve objections
or propose amendments thereto within 10 days after
service. Thereupon the statement and any objections
or proposed amendments shall be submitted to the dis-
trict court for settlement and approval and as settled
and approved shall be included by the clerk of the district
court in the record on appeal.
(d) CORRECTION OR MODIFICATION OF THE RECORD. If
any difference arises as to whether the record truly dis-
closes what occurred in the district court, the difference.
shall be submitted to and settled by that court and the
record made to conform to the truth. If anything mate-
rial to either party is omitted from the record by error or
accident or is misstated therein, the parties by stipula-
tion, or the district court, either before or after the record
is transmitted to the court of appeals, or the court of
appeals, on proper suggestion or of its own initiative,
may direct that the omission or misstatement be cor-
rected, and if necessary that a supplemental record be
certified and transmitted. All other questions as to the
form and content of the record shall be presented to the
court of appeals.
(e) TRANSMISSION OF THE RECORD. Within the time
provided or fixed under the provisions of Rule 73 (g).
for filing the record and docketing the appeal, the clerk
of the district court shall transmit the record to the clerk
of the court of appeals. The appellant shall comply
with the provisions of subdivision (b) of this rule and
shall take any other action necessary to enable the clerk
to assemble and transmit the record. If more than one
appeal is taken, each appellant shall comply with the

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
290
provisions of subdivision (b) and of this subdivision, and
a single record shall be transmitted. Documents of un-
usual bulk or weight and physical exhibits other than
documents shall not be transmitted by the clerk unless
he is directed to do so by a party or by the clerk of
the court of appeals. A party must make advance
arrangements with the clerks of both courts for the
transportation and receipt of bulky or weighty exhibits.
Upon stipulation of the parties, or by order of the
district court at the request of any party, the clerk shall
retain the record for use by the parties in preparing
appellate papers. In that event, the appellant shall
cause the record to be filed and the appeal to be docketed
in the court of appeals within the time provided or fixed
under the provisions of Rule 73 (g) by presenting to the
clerk of the court of appeals a partial record in the form
of a copy of the docket entries, accompanied by a cer-
tificate of counsel for the appellant, or of the appellant
if he is without counsel, reciting that the record, includ-
ing the transcript or parts thereof designated for inclu-
sion and all necessary exhibits, is complete for purposes.
of the appeal. Upon receipt of the brief of the appellee,
or at such earlier time as the parties may agree, or as
the court may order, the appellant shall request the
clerk of the district court to transmit the record.
(f) RETENTION OF THE RECORD IN THE DISTRICT
COURT BY ORDER OF COURT. The court of appeals may
provide by rule or order that a certified copy of the
docket entries shall be transmitted in lieu of the record,
subject to the right of any party to request at any time
during the pendency of the appeal that designated parts
of the record be transmitted. If the record is required
in the district court for use there pending the appeal, the
district court may make an order to that effect, and the
clerk shall retain the record and shall transmit a copy
of the order and of the docket entries together with such
parts of the record as the district court shall allow and
copies of such parts as the parties may designate. If the

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
291
record is retained in the district court by order of either
court, the clerk shall retain it subject to the order of the
court of appeals, and transmission of the copy of the
docket entries shall constitute transmission of the record.
(g) RECORD FOR PRELIMINARY HEARING IN THE COURT
OF APPEALS. If prior to the time the record is trans-
mitted a party desires to make in the court of appeals a
motion for dismissal, for admission to bail, for a stay
pending appeal, for additional security on the bond on
appeal or on a supersedeas bond, or for any intermediate
order, the clerk at the request of any party shall transmit
to the court of appeals such parts of the original record
as the parties shall designate.
(h) RETURN OF THE RECORD TO THE DISTRICT COURT.
After an appeal has been disposed of, the original papers
comprising the record on appeal shall be returned to the
custody of the district court.
RULE 81. APPLICABILITY IN GENERAL
(a) To WHAT PROCEEDINGS APPLICABLE.
(1) These rules do not apply to prize proceed-
ings in admiralty governed by Title 10, U. S. C.,

relating to boards of arbitration of railway labor dis-
putes, these rules apply only to the extent that mat-
ters of procedure are not provided for in those
statutes. These rules apply (1) to proceedings to
compel the giving of testimony or production of

an officer or agency of the United States under any
statute of the United States except as otherwise pro-
vided by statute or by rules of the district court or
by order of the court in the proceedings, and (2) to

SUPPLEMENTAL RULES FOR CERTAIN
ADMIRALTY AND MARITIME CLAIMS
RULE A. SCOPE OF RULES
These Supplemental Rules apply to the procedure in
admiralty and maritime claims within the meaning of
Rule 9 (h) with respect to the following remedies:
(1) Maritime attachment and garnishment;
(2) Actions in rem;
(3) Possessory, petitory, and partition actions;
(4) Actions for exoneration from or limitation of
liability.
These rules also apply to the procedure in statutory
condemnation proceedings analogous to maritime actions
in rem, whether within the admiralty and maritime juris-
diction or not. Except as otherwise provided, references
in these Supplemental Rules to actions in rem include
such analogous statutory condemnation proceedings.
The general Rules of Civil Procedure for the United
States District Courts are also applicable to the fore-
going proceedings except to the extent that they are
inconsistent with these Supplemental Rules.
RULE B. ATTACHMENT AND GARNISHMENT:
SPECIAL PROVISIONS
(1) WHEN AVAILABLE; COMPLAINT, AFFIDAVIT, AND
PROCESS. With respect to any admiralty or maritime
claim in personam a verified complaint may contain a
prayer for process to attach the defendant's goods and
chattels, or credits and effects in the hands of garnishees
named in the complaint to the amount sued for, if the
defendant shall not be found within the district. Such
a complaint shall be accompanied by an affidavit signed
by the plaintiff or his attorney that, to the affiant's
295
1

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
296
knowledge, or to the best of his information and belief,
the defendant cannot be found within the district. When
a verified complaint is supported by such an affidavit the
clerk shall forthwith issue a summons and process of
attachment and garnishment. In addition, or in the
alternative, the plaintiff may, pursuant to Rule 4 (e),
invoke the remedies provided by state law for attach-
ment and garnishment or similar seizure of the defend-
ant's property. Except for Rule E (8) these Supple-
mental Rules do not apply to state remedies so invoked.
(2) NOTICE TO DEFENDANT. No judgment by default
shall be entered except upon proof, which may be by
affidavit, (a) that the plaintiff or the garnishee has given
notice of the action to the defendant by mailing to him
a copy of the complaint, summons, and process of attach-
ment or garnishment, using any form of mail requiring
a return receipt, or (b) that the complaint, summons,
and process of attachment or garnishment have been
served on the defendant in a manner authorized by Rule
4 (d) or (i), or (c) that the plaintiff or the garnishee has
made diligent efforts to give notice of the action to the
defendant and has been unable to do so.
(3) ANSWER.
(a) BY GARNISHEE. The garnishee shall serve
his answer, together with answers to any interroga-
tories served with the complaint, within 20 days
after service of process upon him. Interrogatories
to the garnishee may be served with the complaint.
without leave of court. If the garnishee refuses or
neglects to answer on oath as to the debts, credits,
or effects of the defendant in his hands, or any inter-
rogatories concerning such debts, credits, and effects
that may be propounded by the plaintiff, the court
may award compulsory process against him. If he
admits any debts, credits, or effects, they shall be
held in his hands or paid into the registry of the
court, and shall be held in either case subject to the
further order of the court.

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
297
(b) BY DEFENDANT. The defendant shall serve
his answer within 30 days after process has been
executed, whether by attachment of property or
service on the garnishee.
RULE C. ACTIONS IN REM: SPECIAL
PROVISIONS
(1) WHEN AVAILABLE. An action in rem may be
brought:
(a) To enforce any maritime lien;
(b) Whenever a statute of the United States pro-
vides for a maritime action in rem or a proceeding
analogous thereto.
Except as otherwise provided by law a party who may
proceed in rem may also, or in the alternative, proceed
in personam against any person who may be liable.
Statutory provisions exempting vessels or other prop-
erty owned or possessed by or operated by or for the
United States from arrest or seizure are not affected by
this rule. When a statute so provides, an action against
the United States or an instrumentality thereof may pro-
ceed on in rem principles.
(2) COMPLAINT. In actions in rem the complaint
shall be verified on oath or solemn affirmation. It shall
describe with reasonable particularity the property that
is the subject of the action and state that it is within the
district or will be during the pendency of the action. In
actions for the enforcement of forfeitures for violation of
any statute of the United States the complaint shall state
the place of seizure and whether it was on land or on
navigable waters, and shall contain such allegations as
may be required by the statute pursuant to which the
action is brought.
(3) PROCESS. Upon the filing of the complaint the
clerk shall forthwith issue a warrant for the arrest of the
vessel or other property that is the subject of the action
and deliver it to the marshal for service. If the property
that is the subject of the action consists in whole or in
"

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
298
part of freight, or the proceeds of property sold, or other
intangible property, the clerk shall issue a summons.
directing any person having control of the funds to show
cause why they should not be paid into court to abide
the judgment.
(4) NOTICE. No notice other than the execution of
the process is required when the property that is the sub-
ject of the action has been released in accordance with
Rule E (5). If the property is not released within 10.
days after execution of process, the plaintiff shall
promptly or within such time as may be allowed by the
court cause public notice of the action and arrest to be
given in a newspaper of general circulation in the dis-
trict, designated by order of the court. Such notice shall
specify the time within which the answer is required to
be filed as provided by subdivision (6) of this rule. This
rule does not affect the requirements of notice in actions
to foreclose a preferred ship mortgage pursuant to the
Act of June 5, 1920, ch. 250, § 30, as amended.
(5) ANCILLARY PROCESS. In any action in rem in
which process has been served as provided by this rule,
if any part of the property that is the subject of the
action has not been brought within the control of the
court because it has been removed or sold, or because it
is intangible property in the hands of a person who has
not been served with process, the court may, on motion,
order any person having possession or control of such
property or its proceeds to show cause why it should not
be delivered into the custody of the marshal or paid into
court to abide the judgment; and, after hearing, the
court may enter such judgment as law and justice may
require.
(6) CLAIM
AND ANSWER; INTERROGATORIES. The
claimant of property that is the subject of an action in
rem shall file his claim within 10 days after process has
been executed, or within such additional time as may be
allowed by the court, and shall serve his answer within
20 days after the filing of the claim. The claim shall be

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
299
verified on oath or solemn affirmation, and shall state the
interest in the property by virtue of which the claimant
demands its restitution and the right to defend the
action. If the claim is made on behalf of the person
entitled to possession by an agent, bailee, or attorney,
it shall state that he is duly authorized to make the
claim. At the time of answering the claimant shall also
serve answers to any interrogatories served with the com-
plaint. In actions in rem interrogatories may be so
served without leave of court.
RULE D. POSSESSORY, PETITORY, AND PARTITION
ACTIONS
In all actions for possession, partition, and to try title
maintainable according to the course of the admiralty
practice with respect to a vessel, in all actions so main-
tainable with respect to the possession of cargo or other
maritime property, and in all actions by one or more part
owners against the others to obtain security for the re-
turn of the vessel from any voyage undertaken without
their consent, or by one or more part owners against the
others to obtain possession of the vessel for any voyage
on giving security for its safe return, the process shall be
by a warrant of arrest of the vessel, cargo, or other prop-
erty, and by notice in the manner provided by Rule B (2)
to the adverse party or parties.
RULE E. ACTIONS IN REM AND QUASI IN REM:
GENERAL PROVISIONS
(1) APPLICABILITY. Except as otherwise provided,
this rule applies to actions in personam with process of
maritime attachment and garnishment, actions in rem,
and petitory, possessory, and partition actions, supple-
menting Rules B, C, and D.
(2) COMPLAINT; SECURITY.
(a) COMPLAINT. In actions to which this rule is
applicable the complaint shall state the circum-
stances from which the claim arises with such par-

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
300
ticularity that the defendant or claimant will be
able, without moving for a more definite statement,
to commence an investigation of the facts and to
frame a responsive pleading.
(b) SECURITY FOR COSTS. Subject to the provi-
sions of Rule 54 (d) and of relevant statutes, the
court may, on the filing of the complaint or on the
appearance of any defendant, claimant, or any other
party, or at any later time, require the plaintiff,
defendant, claimant, or other party to give security,
or additional security, in such sum as the court shall
direct to pay all costs and expenses that shall be
awarded against him by any interlocutory order or
by the final judgment, or on appeal by any appellate
court.
(3) PROCESS.
(a) TERRITORIAL LIMITS OF EFFECTIVE SERVICE.
Process in rem and of maritime attachment and
garnishment shall be served only within the district.
(b) ISSUANCE AND DELIVERY. Issuance and de-
livery of process in rem, or of maritime attachment.
and garnishment, shall be held in abeyance if the
plaintiff so requests.
(4) EXECUTION OF PROCESS; MARSHAL'S RETURN;
CUSTODY OF PROPERTY.
(a) IN GENERAL. Upon issuance and delivery of
the process, or, in the case of summons with process
of attachment and garnishment, when it appears
that the defendant cannot be found within the dis-
trict, the marshal shall forthwith execute the process
in accordance with this subdivision (4), making due
and prompt return.
(b) TANGIBLE PROPERTY. If tangible property is
to be attached or arrested, the marshal shall take it
into his possession for safe custody. If the charac-
ter or situation of the property is such that the tak-
ing of actual possession is impracticable, the marshal

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
301
shall execute the process by affixing a copy thereof
to the property in a conspicuous place and by leav-
ing a copy of the complaint and process with the
person having possession or his agent. In further-
ance of his custody of any vessel the marshal is
authorized to make a written request to the collector
of customs not to grant clearance to such vessel until
notified by the marshal or his deputy or by the clerk
that the vessel has been released in accordance with
these rules.
(c) INTANGIBLE PROPERTY. If intangible prop-
erty is to be attached or arrested the marshal shall
execute the process by leaving with the garnishee or
other obligor a copy of the complaint and process
requiring him to answer as provided in Rules
B (3) (a) and C (6); or he may accept for payment
into the registry of the court the amount owed to
the extent of the amount claimed by the plaintiff
with interest and costs, in which event the garnishee
or other obligor shall not be required to answer
unless alias process shall be served.
(d) DIRECTIONS WITH RESPECT TO PROPERTY IN
CUSTODY. The marshal may at any time apply to
the court for directions with respect to property that
has been attached or arrested, and shall give notice
of such application to any or all of the parties as the
court may direct.
(e) EXPENSES OF SEIZING AND KEEPING PROP-
ERTY; DEPOSIT. These rules do not alter the provi-
sions of Title 28, U. S. C., § 1921, as amended, rela-
tive to the expenses of seizing and keeping property
attached or arrested and to the requirement of
deposits to cover such expenses.
(5) RELEASE OF PROPERTY.
(a) SPECIAL BOND. Except in cases of seizures
for forfeiture under any law of the United States,
whenever process of maritime attachment and gar-
200-278 0-66-64

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
302
nishment or process in rem is issued the execution
of such process shall be stayed, or the property re-
leased, on the giving of security, to be approved
by the court or clerk, or by stipulation of the parties,
conditioned to answer the judgment of the court or
of any appellate court. The parties may stipulate
the amount and nature of such security. In the
event of the inability or refusal of the parties so to
stipulate the court shall fix the principal sum of
the bond or stipulation at an amount sufficient to
cover the amount of the plaintiff's claim fairly
stated with accrued interest and costs; but the prin-
cipal sum shall in no event exceed (i) twice the
amount of the plaintiff's claim or (ii) the value of
the property on due appraisement, whichever is
smaller. The bond or stipulation shall be condi-
tioned for the payment of the principal sum and
interest thereon at 6 per cent per annum.
(b) GENERAL BOND. The owner of any vessel
may file a general bond or stipulation, with sufficient
surety, to be approved by the court, conditioned to
answer the judgment of such court in all or any
actions that may be brought thereafter in such court
in which the vessel is attached or arrested. There-
upon the execution of all such process against such
vessel shall be stayed so long as the amount secured
by such bond or stipulation is at least double the
aggregate amount claimed by plaintiffs in all actions
begun and pending in which such vessel has been
attached or arrested. Judgments and remedies may
be had on such bond or stipulation as if a special
bond or stipulation had been filed in each of such
actions. The district court may make necessary
orders to carry this rule into effect, particularly as
to the giving of proper notice of any action against
or attachment of a vessel for which a general bond
has been filed. Such bond or stipulation shall be
indorsed by the clerk with a minute of the actions

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
303
wherein process is so stayed. Further security may
be required by the court at any time.
If a special bond or stipulation is given in a par-
ticular case, the liability on the general bond or
stipulation shall cease as to that case.
(c) RELEASE BY CONSENT OR STIPULATION; ORDER
OF COURT OR CLERK; COSTS. Any vessel, cargo, or
other property in the custody of the marshal may be
released forthwith upon his acceptance and approval
of a stipulation, bond, or other security, signed by
the party on whose behalf the property is detained
or his attorney and expressly authorizing such re-
lease, if all costs and charges of the court and its
officers shall have first been paid. Otherwise no
property in the custody of the marshal or other offi-
cer of the court shall be released without an order
of the court; but such order may be entered as of
course by the clerk, upon the giving of approved
security as provided by law and these rules, or upon
the dismissal or discontinuance of the action; but
the marshal shall not deliver any property so re-
leased until the costs and charges of the officers of
the court shall first have been paid.
(d) POSSESSORY, PETITORY, AND PARTITION AC-
TIONS. The foregoing provisions of this subdivision
(5) do not apply to petitory, possessory, and parti-
tion actions. In such cases the property arrested
shall be released only by order of the court, on such
terms and conditions and on the giving of such
security as the court may require.
(6) REDUCTION OR IMPAIRMENT OF SECURITY. When-
ever security is taken the court may, on motion and hear-
ing, for good cause shown, reduce the amount of security
given; and if the surety shall be or become insufficient,
new or additional sureties may be required on motion
and hearing.
(7) SECURITY ON COUNTERCLAIM. Whenever there is
asserted a counterclaim arising out of the same trans-

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
304
action or occurrence with respect to which the action
was originally filed, and the defendant or claimant in the
original action has given security to respond in damages,
any plaintiff for whose benefit such security has been.
given shall give security in the usual amount and form
to respond in damages to the claims set forth in such
counterclaim, unless the court, for cause shown, shall
otherwise direct; and proceedings on the original claim
shall be stayed until such security is given, unless the
court otherwise directs. When the United States or a
corporate instrumentality thereof as defendant is relieved
by law of the requirement of giving security to respond
in damages it shall nevertheless be treated for the pur-
poses of this subdivision E (7) as if it had given such
security if a private person so situated would have been
required to give it.
(8) RESTRICTED APPEARANCE. An appearance to de-
fend against an admiralty and maritime claim with re-
spect to which there has issued process in rem, or process
of attachment and garnishment whether pursuant to
these Supplemental Rules or to Rule 4 (e), may be ex-
pressly restricted to the defense of such claim, and in that
event shall not constitute an appearance for the purposes
of any other claim with respect to which such process is
not available or has not been served.
(9) DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY; SALES.
(a) ACTIONS FOR FORFEITURES. In any action in
rem to enforce a forfeiture for violation of a statute
of the United States the property shall be disposed
of as provided by statute.
(b) INTERLOCUTORY SALES. If property that has
been attached or arrested is perishable, or liable to
deterioration, decay, or injury by being detained in
custody pending the action, or if the expense of
keeping the property is excessive or disproportionate,
or if there is unreasonable delay in securing the re-
lease of property, the court, on application of any

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
305
party or of the marshal, may order the property or
any portion thereof to be sold; and the proceeds, or
so much thereof as shall be adequate to satisfy any
judgment, may be ordered brought into court to
abide the event of the action; or the court may, on
motion of the defendant or claimant, order delivery
of the property to him, upon the giving of security
in accordance with these rules.
(c) SALES; PROCEEDS. All sales of property shall
be made by the marshal or his deputy, or other
proper officer assigned by the court where the mar-
shal is a party in interest; and the proceeds of sale
shall be forthwith paid into the registry of the court
to be disposed of according to law.
RULE F. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
(1) TIME FOR FILING COMPLAINT; SECURITY. Not
later than six months after his receipt of a claim in
writing, any vessel owner may file a complaint in the
appropriate district court, as provided in subdivision (9)
of this rule, for limitation of liability pursuant to statute.
The owner (a) shall deposit with the court, for the bene-
fit of claimants, a sum equal to the amount or value of
his interest in the vessel and pending freight, or approved
security therefor, and in addition such sums, or approved
security therefor, as the court may from time to time
fix as necessary to carry out the provisions of the statutes
as amended; or (b) at his option shall transfer to a
trustee to be appointed by the court, for the benefit of
claimants, his interest in the vessel and pending freight,
together with such sums, or approved security therefor,
as the court may from time to time fix as necessary to
carry out the provisions of the statutes as amended. The
plaintiff shall also give security for costs and, if he elects
to give security, for interest at the rate of 6 per cent
per annum from the date of the security.
(2) COMPLAINT. The complaint shall set forth the
facts on the basis of which the right to limit liability is

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
306
asserted, and all facts necessary to enable the court to
determine the amount to which the owner's liability shall
be limited. The complaint may demand exoneration.
from as well as limitation of liability. It shall state the
voyage, if any, on which the demands sought to be lim-
ited arose, with the date and place of its termination;
the amount of all demands including all unsatisfied liens.
or claims of lien, in contract or in tort or otherwise, aris-
ing on that voyage, so far as known to the plaintiff, and
what actions and proceedings, if any, are pending
thereon; whether the vessel was damaged, lost, or aban-
doned, and, if so, when and where; the value of the ves-
sel at the close of the voyage or, in case of wreck, the
value of her wreckage, strippings, or proceeds, if any,
and where and in whose possession they are; and the
amount of any pending freight recovered or recoverable.
If the plaintiff elects to transfer his interest in the vessel
to a trustee, the complaint must further show any prior
paramount liens thereon, and what voyages or trips, if
any, she has made since the voyage or trip on which the
claims sought to be limited arose, and any existing liens
arising upon any such subsequent voyage or trip, with
the amounts and causes thereof, and the names and
addresses of the lienors, so far as known; and whether
the vessel sustained any injury upon or by reason of such
subsequent voyage or trip.
(3) CLAIMS AGAINST OWNER; INJUNCTION. Upon
compliance by the owner with the requirements of sub-
division (1) of this rule all claims and proceedings against
the owner or his property with respect to the matter in
question shall cease. On application of the plaintiff the
court shall enjoin the further prosecution of any action
or proceeding against the plaintiff or his property with
respect to any claim subject to limitation in the action.
(4) NOTICE TO CLAIMANTS. Upon the owner's com-
pliance with subdivision (1) of this rule the court shall
issue a notice to all persons asserting claims with respect
to which the complaint seeks limitation, admonishing

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
307
them to file their respective claims with the clerk of the
court and to serve on the attorneys for the plaintiff a
copy thereof on or before a date to be named in the
notice. The date so fixed shall not be less than 30 days
after issuance of the notice. For cause shown, the court
may enlarge the time within which claims may be filed.
The notice shall be published in such newspaper or news-
papers as the court may direct once a week for four suc-
cessive weeks prior to the date fixed for the filing of
claims. The plaintiff not later than the day of second
publication shall also mail a copy of the notice to every
person known to have made any claim against the vessel
or the plaintiff arising out of the voyage or trip on which
the claims sought to be limited arose. In cases involving
death a copy of such notice shall be mailed to the
decedent at his last known address, and also to any per-
son who shall be known to have made any claim on
account of such death.
(5) CLAIMS AND ANSWER. Claims shall be filed and
served on or before the date specified in the notice pro-
vided for in subdivision (4) of this rule. Each claim
shall specify the facts upon which the claimant relies in
support of his claim, the items thereof, and the dates on
which the same accrued. If a claimant desires to con-
test either the right to exoneration from or the right to
limitation of liability he shall file and serve an answer
to the complaint unless his claim has included an answer.
(6) INFORMATION TO BE GIVEN CLAIMANTS. Within
30 days after the date specified in the notice for filing
claims, or within such time as the court thereafter may
allow, the plaintiff shall mail to the attorney for each
claimant (or if the claimant has no attorney to the
claimant himself) a list setting forth (a) the name of
each claimant, (b) the name and address of his attorney
(if he is known to have one), (c) the nature of his claim,
i. e., whether property loss, property damage, death,
personal injury, etc., and (d) the amount thereof.

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
308
(7) INSUFFICIENCY OF FUND OR SECURITY. Any claim-
ant may by motion demand that the funds deposited in
court or the security given by the plaintiff be increased
on the ground that they are less than the value of the
plaintiff's interest in the vessel and pending freight.
Thereupon the court shall cause due appraisement to
be made of the value of the plaintiff's interest in the
vessel and pending freight; and if the court finds that
the deposit or security is either insufficient or excessive
it shall order its increase or reduction. In like manner
any claimant may demand that the deposit or security
be increased on the ground that it is insufficient to carry
out the provisions of the statutes relating to claims in
respect of loss of life or bodily injury; and, after notice
and hearing, the court may similarly order that the
deposit or security be increased or reduced.
(8) OBJECTIONS TO CLAIMS: DISTRIBUTION OF FUND.
Any interested party may question or controvert any
claim without filing an objection thereto. Upon deter-
mination of liability the fund deposited or secured, or
the proceeds of the vessel and pending freight, shall be
divided pro rata, subject to all relevant provisions of law,
among the several claimants in proportion to the amounts
of their respective claims, duly proved, saving, however,
to all parties any priority to which they may be legally
entitled.
(9) VENUE; TRANSFER. The complaint shall be filed
in any district in which the vessel has been attached or
arrested to answer for any claim with respect to which
the plaintiff seeks to limit liability; or, if the vessel has
not been attached or arrested, then in any district in
which the owner has been sued with respect to any such
claim. When the vessel has not been attached or
arrested to answer the matters aforesaid, and suit has
not been commenced against the owner, the proceedings
may be had in the district in which the vessel may be,
but if the vessel is not within any district and no suit has
been commenced in any district, then the complaint may
like

RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE.
309
be filed in any district. For the convenience of parties
and witnesses, in the interest of justice, the court may
transfer the action to any district; if venue is wrongly
laid the court shall dismiss or, if it be in the interest of
justice, transfer the action to any district in which it
could have been brought. If the vessel shall have been
sold, the proceeds shall represent the vessel for the
purposes of these rules.
2. That the foregoing amendments and additions to the
Rules of Civil Procedure shall take effect on July 1, 1966,
and shall govern all proceedings in actions brought there-
after and also in all further proceedings in actions then
pending, except to the extent that in the opinion of the
court their application in a particular action then pending
would not be feasible or would work injustice, in which
event the former procedure applies.
3. That the Chief Justice be, and he hereby is, author-
ized to transmit to the Congress the foregoing amend-
ments and additions to the Rules of Civil Procedure in
accordance with the provisions of Title 28, U.S.C., §§ 2072
and 2073.
4. That: (a) subdivision (c) of Rule 6 of the Rules of
Civil Procedure for the United States District Courts
promulgated by this court on December 20, 1937, effective
September 16, 1938; (b) Rule 2 of the Rules for Practice
and Procedure under section 25 of An Act To amend and
consolidate the Acts respecting copyright, approved
March 4, 1909, promulgated by this court on June 1, 1909,
effective July 1, 1909; and (c) the Rules of Practice in
Admiralty and Maritime Cases, promulgated by this court
on December 6, 1920, effective March 7, 1921, as revised,
amended and supplemented, be, and they hereby are,
rescinded, effective July 1, 1966.

STATEMENT OF BLACK, J.

STATEMENT OF BLACK, J.
MR. JUSTICE BLACK, dissenting.
The Amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil and
Criminal Procedure today transmitted to the Congress
are the work of very capable advisory committees. Those
committees, not the Court, wrote the rules. Whether by
this transmittal the individual members of the Court
who voted to transmit the rules intended to express
approval of the varied policy decisions the rules embody
I am not sure. I am reasonably certain, however, that
the Court's transmittal does not carry with it a decision
that the amended rules are all constitutional. For such
a decision would be the equivalent of an advisory opinion
which, I assume the Court would unanimously agree, we
are without constitutional power to give. And I agree
with my Brother DOUGLAS that some of the proposed
criminal rules go to the very border line if they do not
actually transgress the constitutional right of a defend-
ant not to be compelled to be a witness against himself.
This phase of the criminal rules in itself so infects the
whole collection of proposals that, without mentioning
other objections, I am opposed to transmittal of the
proposed amendments to the criminal rules.
I am likewise opposed to transmittal of the proposed
revision of the civil rules. In the first place I think the
provisions of 28 U. S. C. § 2072 (1964 ed.), under which
these rules are transmitted and the corresponding section,
18 U. S. C. § 3771 (1964 ed.), relating to the criminal
rules, both of which provide for giving transmitted rules

the effect of law as though they had been properly
enacted by Congress are unconstitutional for reasons I
have previously stated. ¹ And in prior dissents I have
stated some of the basic reasons for my objections to
repeated rules revisions 2 that tend to upset established
meanings and need not repeat those grounds of objec-
tion here. The confusion created by the adoption of the
present rules, over my objection, has been partially dis-
pelled by judicial interpretations of them by this Court
and others. New rules and extensive amendments to
present rules will mean renewed confusion resulting in
new challenges and new reversals and prejudicial "pre-
trial" dismissals of cases before a trial on the merits for
failure of lawyers to understand and comply with new
rules of uncertain meaning. Despite my continuing ob-
jection to the old rules, it seems to me that since they
have at least gained some degree of certainty it would be
wiser to "bear those ills we have than fly to others we
know not of," unless, of course, we are reasonably sure
that the proposed reforms of the old rules are badly.
needed. But I am not. The new proposals, at least
some of them, have, as I view them, objectionable pos-
1 In a statement accompanying a previous transmittal of the civil
rules, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and I said:
"MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS are opposed to
the submission of these rules to the Congress under a statute which
permits them to ‘take effect' and to repeal ‘all laws in conflict with
such rules' without requiring any affirmative consideration, action,
or approval of the rules by Congress or by the President. We
believe that while some of the Rules of Civil Procedure are simply
housekeeping details, many determine matters so substantially affect-
ing the rights of litigants in lawsuits that in practical effect they are
the equivalent of new legislation which, in our judgment, the Con-
stitution requires to be initiated in and enacted by the Congress and
approved by the President. The Constitution, as we read it, pro-
vides that all laws shall be enacted by the House, the Senate, and the
President, not by the mere failure of Congress to reject proposals of
an outside agency. . . ." (Footnotes omitted.) 374 U. S. 865-866.

sibilities that cause me to believe our judicial system
could get along much better without them.
The momentum given the proposed revision of the
old rules by this Court's transmittal makes it practically
certain that Congress, just as has this Court, will permit
the rules to take effect exactly as they were written by
the Advisory Committee on Rules. Nevertheless, I am
including here a memorandum I submitted to the Court
expressing objections to the Committee's proposals and
suggesting changes should they be transmitted. These
suggestions chiefly center around rules that grant broad
discretion to trial judges with reference to class suits,
pretrial procedures, and dismissal of cases with prejudice.
Cases coming before the federal courts over the years.
now filling nearly 40 volumes of Federal Rules Decisions
show an accumulation of grievances by lawyers and liti-
gants about the way many trial judges exercise their
almost unlimited discretionary powers to use pretrial
procedures to dismiss cases without trials. In fact, many
of these cases indicate a belief of many judges and legal
commentators that the cause of justice is best served in
the long run not by trials on the merits but by summary
dismissals based on out of court affidavits, pretrial depo-
sitions, and other pretrial techniques. My belief is that
open court trials on the merits where litigants have the
right to prove their case or defense best comports with
due process of law.
The proposed rules revisions, instead of introducing
changes designed to prevent the continued abuse of pre-
trial power to dismiss cases summarily without trials,
move in the opposite direction. Of course, each such
dismissal results in removal of one more case from our
congested court dockets, but that factor should not weigh
more heavily in our system of justice than assuring a
full-fledged due process trial of every bona fide lawsuit
brought to vindicate an honest, substantial claim. It is
to protect this ancient right of a person to have his case
tried rather than summarily thrown out of court that I

STATEMENT OF BLACK, J.
312
suggested to the Court that it recommend changes in the
Committee's proposals of the nature set out in the
following memorandum.
"Dear Brethren:
"I have gone over all the proposed amendments care-
fully and while there are probably some good sugges-
tions, it is my belief that the bad results that can come
from the adoption of these amendments predominate
over any good they can bring about. I particularly
think that every member of the Court should examine
with great care the amendments relating to class suits.
It seems to me that they place too much power in the
hands of the trial judges and that the rules might almost
as well simply provide that 'class suits can be main-
tained either for or against particular groups whenever
in the discretion of a judge he thinks it is wise.' The
power given to the judge to dismiss such suits or to
divide them up into groups at will subjects members of
classes to dangers that could not follow from carefully
prescribed legal standards enacted to control class suits.
"In addition, the rules as amended, in my judgment,
greatly aggravate the evil of vesting judges with prac-
tically uncontrolled power to dismiss with prejudice cases
brought by plaintiffs or defenses interposed by defend-
ants. The power to dismiss a plaintiff's case or to render
judgments by default against defendants can work great
harm to both parties. There are many inherent urges in
existence which may subconsciously incline a judge
towards disposing of the cases before him without hav-
ing to go through the burden of a trial. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice White, before he became Chief Justice, wrote an
opinion in the case of Hovey v. Elliott, 167 U. S. 409,
which pointed out grave constitutional questions raised
by attempting to punish the parties by depriving them
of the right to try their law suits or to defend against law
suits brought against them by others.

STATEMENT OF BLACK, J.
313
"Rule 41 entitled 'Dismissal of Actions' points up the
great power of judges to dismiss actions and provides
an automatic method under which a dismissal must be
construed as a dismissal 'with prejudice' unless the
judge specifically states otherwise. For that reason I
suggest to the Conference that if the Rules are accepted,
including that one, the last sentence of Rule 41 (b) be
amended so as to provide that a simple order of dismissal
by a judge instead of operating 'as an adjudication upon
the merits,' as the amended rule reads, shall provide
that such a dismissal 'does not operate as an adjudication
upon the merits.'
"As a further guarantee against oppressive dismissals I
suggest the addition of the following as subdivision (c)
of Rule 41.
"'No plaintiff's case shall be dismissed or defendant's
right to defend be cut off because of the neglect,
misfeasance, malfeasance, or failure of their counsel
to obey any order of the court, until and unless such
plaintiff or defendant shall have been personally
served with notice of their counsel's delinquency,
and not then unless the parties themselves do or fail
to do something on their own part that can legally
justify dismissal of the plaintiff's case or of the
defendant's defense.'
"This proposed amendment is suggested in order to
protect litigants, both plaintiffs and defendants, against
being thrown out of court as a penalty for their lawyer's
neglect or misconduct. The necessity for such a rule is
shown, I think, by the dismissal in the plaintiff's case
in Link v. Wabash R. Co., 370 U. S. 626. The usual
argument against this suggestion is that a party to a law
suit hires his lawyer and should therefore be responsible
for everything his lawyer does in the conduct of his case.
This may be a good argument with reference to affluent
litigants who not only know the best lawyers but are able

7
STATEMENT OF BLACK, J.
314
to hire them. It is a wholly unrealistic argument, how-
ever, to make with reference to individual persons who
do not know the ability of various lawyers or who are
not financially able to hire those at the top of the bar
and who are compelled to rely on the assumption that
a lawyer licensed by the State is competent. It seems to
me to be an uncivilized practice to punish clients by
throwing their cases out of court because of their lawyers'
conduct. It may be supportable by good, sound, formal
logic but I think has no support whatever in a procedural
system supposed to work as far as humanly possible to
the end of obtaining equal and exact justice.
"H. L. B."
For all the reasons stated above and in my previous
objections to the transmittals of rules I dissent from the
transmittals here.

ORDERED:
ORDER
1. That the Rules of Criminal Procedure for the
United States District Courts be, and they hereby are,
amended by including therein Rules 17.1 and 26.1 and
amendments to Rules 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 14, 16, 17, 18, 20,
21, 23, 24, 25, 28, 29, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, 40, 44,
45, 46, 49, 54, 55, and 56, and to Form 26, as hereinafter
set forth:

AMENDMENTS TO RULES OF CRIMINAL
PROCEDURE
FOR THE
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURTS
RULE 4. WARRANT OR SUMMONS UPON COMPLAINT
(a) ISSUANCE. If it appears from the complaint, or
from an affidavit or affidavits filed with the complaint,
that there is probable cause to believe that an offense
has been committed and that the defendant has com-
mitted it, a warrant for the arrest of the defendant shall
issue to any officer authorized by law to execute it. Upon
the request of the attorney for the government a sum-
mons instead of a warrant shall issue. More than one
warrant or summons may issue on the same complaint.
If a defendant fails to appear in response to the summons,
a warrant shall issue.
RULE 5. PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE COMMISSIONER
(b) STATEMENT BY THE COMMISSIONER. The com-
missioner shall inform the defendant of the complaint
against him and of any affidavit filed therewith, of his
right to retain counsel, of his right to request the assign-
ment of counsel if he is unable to obtain counsel, and
of his right to have a preliminary examination. He shall
also inform the defendant that he is not required to make
a statement and that any statement made by him may
be used against him. The commissioner shall allow the
defendant reasonable time and opportunity to consult
counsel and shall admit the defendant to bail as provided
in these rules.
RULE 6. THE GRAND JURY
(d) WHO MAY BE PRESENT. Attorneys for the gov-
ernment, the witness under examination, interpreters
316

RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE.
317
when needed and, for the purpose of taking the evidence,
a stenographer or operator of a recording device may be
present while the grand jury is in session, but no person
other than the jurors may be present while the grand
jury is deliberating or voting.
(e) SECRECY OF PROCEEDINGS AND DISCLOSURE. Dis-
closure of matters occurring before the grand jury other
than its deliberations and the vote of any juror may
be made to the attorneys for the government for use in
the performance of their duties. Otherwise a juror, at-
torney, interpreter, stenographer, operator of a recording
device, or any typist who transcribes recorded testimony
may disclose matters occurring before the grand jury only
when so directed by the court preliminarily to or in con-
nection with a judicial proceeding or when permitted by
the court at the request of the defendant upon a show-
ing that grounds may exist for a motion to dismiss the
indictment because of matters occurring before the grand
jury. No obligation of secrecy may be imposed upon
any person except in accordance with this rule. The
court may direct that an indictment shall be kept secret
until the defendant is in custody or has given bail, and
in that event the clerk shall seal the indictment and no
person shall disclose the finding of the indictment except
when necessary for the issuance and execution of a war-
rant or summons.
(f) FINDING AND RETURN OF INDICTMENT. An indict-
ment may be found only upon the concurrence of 12
or more jurors. The indictment shall be returned by
the grand jury to a judge in open court. If the defend-
ant is in custody or has given bail and 12 jurors do not
concur in finding an indictment, the foreman shall so
report to the court in writing forthwith.
RULE 7. THE INDICTMENT AND THE INFORMATION
(f) BILL OF PARTICULARS. The court may direct the
filing of a bill of particulars. A motion for a bill of par-
ticulars may be made before arraignment or within 10
200-278 0-66--66

RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE.
318
days after arraignment or at such later time as the court
may permit. A bill of particulars may be amended at
any time subject to such conditions as justice requires.
RULE 11. PLEAS
A defendant may plead not guilty, guilty or, with the
consent of the court, nolo contendere. The court may
refuse to accept a plea of guilty, and shall not accept
such plea or a plea of nolo contendere without first ad-
dressing the defendant personally and determining that
the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of the
nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea.
If a defendant refuses to plead or if the court refuses to
accept a plea of guilty or if a defendant corporation fails
to appear, the court shall enter a plea of not guilty. The
court shall not enter a judgment upon a plea of guilty
unless it is satisfied that there is a factual basis for the
plea.
RULE 14. RELIEF FROM PREJUDICIAL JOINDER
If it appears that a defendant or the government is
prejudiced by a joinder of offenses or of defendants in an
indictment or information or by such joinder for trial
together, the court may order an election or separate
trials of counts, grant a severance of defendants or pro-
vide whatever other relief justice requires. In ruling on
a motion by a defendant for severance the court may
order the attorney for the government to deliver to the
court for inspection in camera any statements or confes-
sions made by the defendants which the government
intends to introduce in evidence at the trial.
RULE 16. DISCOVERY AND INSPECTION
(a) DEFENDANT'S STATEMENTS; REPORTS OF EXAMI-
NATIONS AND TESTS; DEFENDANT'S GRAND JURY TESTI-
MONY. Upon motion of a defendant the court may order
the attorney for the government to permit the defendant
to inspect and copy or photograph any relevant (1) writ-
ten or recorded statements or confessions made by the

RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE.
319
defendant, or copies thereof, within the possession, cus-
tody or control of the government, the existence of which
is known, or by the exercise of due diligence may become
known, to the attorney for the government, (2) results
or reports of physical or mental examinations, and of
scientific tests or experiments made in connection with
the particular case, or copies thereof, within the posses-
sion, custody or control of the government, the existence
of which is known, or by the exercise of due diligence
may become known, to the attorney for the government,
and (3) recorded testimony of the defendant before a
grand jury.
(b) OTHER BOOKS, PAPERS, DOCUMENTS, TANGIBLE
OBJECTS OR PLACES. Upon motion of a defendant the
court may order the attorney for the government to per-
mit the defendant to inspect and copy or photograph
books, papers, documents, tangible objects, buildings or
places, or copies or portions thereof, which are within the
possession, custody or control of the government, upon
a showing of materiality to the preparation of his defense
and that the request is reasonable. Except as provided
in subdivision (a) (2), this rule does not authorize the
discovery or inspection of reports, memoranda, or other
internal government documents made by government
agents in connection with the investigation or prosecu-
tion of the case, or of statements made by government
witnesses or prospective government witnesses (other
than the defendant) to agents of the government except
as provided in 18 U. S. C. § 3500.
(c) DISCOVERY BY THE GOVERNMENT. If the court
grants relief sought by the defendant under subdivision
(a)(2) or subdivision (b) of this rule, it may, upon
motion of the government, condition its order by requir-
ing that the defendant permit the government to inspect
and copy or photograph scientific or medical reports,
books, papers, documents, tangible objects, or copies or
portions thereof, which the defendant intends to produce
at the trial and which are within his possession, custody

or control, upon a showing of materiality to the prepara-
tion of the government's case and that the request is
reasonable. Except as to scientific or medical reports,
this subdivision does not authorize the discovery or
inspection of reports, memoranda, or other internal de-
fense documents made by the defendant, or his attorneys
or agents in connection with the investigation or defense
of the case, or of statements made by the defendant, or
by government or defense witnesses, or by prospective
government or defense witnesses, to the defendant, his
agents or attorneys.
(d) TIME, PLACE AND MANNER OF DISCOVERY AND
INSPECTION. An order of the court granting relief under
this rule shall specify the time, place and manner of mak-
ing the discovery and inspection permitted and may
prescribe such terms and conditions as are just.
(e) PROTECTIVE ORDERS. Upon a sufficient showing
the court may at any time order that the discovery or
inspection be denied, restricted or deferred, or make such
other order as is appropriate. Upon motion by the gov-
ernment the court may permit the government to make
such showing, in whole or in part, in the form of a writ-
ten statement to be inspected by the court in camera.
If the court enters an order granting relief following a
showing in camera, the entire text of the government's
statement shall be sealed and preserved in the records of
the court to be made available to the appellate court in
the event of an appeal by the defendant.
(f) TIME OF MOTIONS. A motion under this rule may
be made only within 10 days after arraignment or at such
reasonable later time as the court may permit. The
motion shall include all relief sought under this rule. A
subsequent motion may be made only upon a showing of
cause why such motion would be in the interest of
justice.
(g) CONTINUING DUTY TO DISCLOSE; FAILURE TO
COMPLY. If, subsequent to compliance with an order
issued pursuant to this rule, and prior to or during trial,
"

RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE.
321
a party discovers additional material previously re-
quested or ordered which is subject to discovery or
inspection under the rule, he shall promptly notify the
other party or his attorney or the court of the existence
of the additional material. If at any time during the
course of the proceedings it is brought to the attention of
the court that a party has failed to comply with this rule
or with an order issued pursuant to this rule, the court
may order such party to permit the discovery or inspec-
tion of materials not previously disclosed, grant a con-
tinuance, or prohibit the party from introducing in evi-
dence the material not disclosed, or it may enter such
other order as it deems just under the circumstances.
RULE 17. SUBPOENA
(b) DEFENDANTS UNABLE TO PAY. The court shall
order at any time that a subpoena be issued for service
on a named witness upon an ex parte application of a
defendant upon a satisfactory showing that the defend-
ant is financially unable to pay the fees of the witness
and that the presence of the witness is necessary to an
adequate defense. If the court orders the subpoena to
be issued the costs incurred by the process and the fees
of the witness so subpoenaed shall be paid in the same
manner in which similar costs and fees are paid in case
of a witness subpoenaed in behalf of the government.
(d) SERVICE. A subpoena may be served by the mar-
shal, by his deputy or by any other person who is not a
party and who is not less than 18 years of age. Service
of a subpoena shall be made by delivering a copy thereof
to the person named and by tendering to him the fee for
1 day's attendance and the mileage allowed by law. Fees
and mileage need not be tendered to the witness upon
service of a subpoena issued in behalf of the United
States or an officer or agency thereof.
RULE 17.1. PRETRIAL CONFERENCE
At any time after the filing of the indictment or infor-
mation the court upon motion of any party or upon its
1

RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE.
322
own motion may order one or more conferences to con-
sider such matters as will promote a fair and expeditious
trial. At the conclusion of a conference the court shall
prepare and file a memorandum of the matters agreed
upon. No admissions made by the defendant or his
attorney at the conference shall be used against the
defendant unless the admissions are reduced to writing
and signed by the defendant and his attorney. This rule
shall not be invoked in the case of a defendant who is
not represented by counsel.
RULE 18. PLACE OF PROSECUTION AND TRIAL
Except as otherwise permitted by statute or by these
rules, the prosecution shall be had in a district in which
the offense was committed. The court shall fix the place
of trial within the district with due regard to the con-
venience of the defendant and the witnesses.
RULE 20. TRANSFER FROM THE DISTRICT FOR
PLEA AND SENTENCE
(a) INDICTMENT OR INFORMATION PENDING. A de-
fendant arrested or held in a district other than that in
which the indictment or information is pending against
him may state in writing that he wishes to plead guilty
or nolo contendere, to waive trial in the district in which
the indictment or information is pending and to consent
to disposition of the case in the district in which he was
arrested or is held, subject to the approval of the United
States attorney for each district. Upon receipt of the
defendant's statement and of the written approval of the
United States attorneys, the clerk of the court in which
the indictment or information is pending shall transmit
the papers in the proceeding or certified copies thereof to
the clerk of the court for the district in which the defend-
ant is held and the prosecution shall continue in that
district.
(b) INDICTMENT OR INFORMATION NOT PENDING. A
defendant arrested on a warrant issued upon a complaint

RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE.
323
in a district other than the district of arrest may state in
writing that he wishes to plead guilty or nolo contendere,
to waive trial in the district in which the warrant was
issued and to consent to disposition of the case in the
district in which he was arrested, subject to the approval
of the United States attorney for each district. Upon
receipt of the defendant's statement and of the written
approval of the United States attorneys and upon the
filing of an information or the return of an indictment,
the clerk of the court for the district in which the war-
rant was issued shall transmit the papers in the proceed-
ing or certified copies thereof to the clerk of the court for
the district in which the defendant was arrested and the
prosecution shall continue in that district. When the
defendant is brought before the court to plead to an
information filed in the district where the warrant was
issued, he may at that time waive indictment as pro-
vided in Rule 7, and the prosecution may continue based
upon the information originally filed.
(c) EFFECT OF NOT GUILTY PLEA. If after the pro-
ceeding has been transferred pursuant to subdivision (a)
or (b) of this rule the defendant pleads not guilty, the
clerk shall return the papers to the court in which the
prosecution was commenced and the proceeding shall be
restored to the docket of that court. The defendant's
statement that he wishes to plead guilty or nolo con-
tendere shall not be used against him.
(d) JUVENILES. A juvenile (as defined in 18 U. S. C.
§ 5031) who is arrested or held in a district other than
that in which he is alleged to have committed an act in
violation of a law of the United States not punishable by
death or life imprisonment may, after he has been ad-
vised by counsel and with the approval of the court and
the United States attorney, consent to be proceeded
against as a juvenile delinquent in the district in which
he is arrested or held. The consent shall be given in
writing before the court but only after the court has
apprised the juvenile of his rights, including the right to

RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE.
324
be returned to the district in which he is alleged to have
committed the act, and of the consequences of such
consent.
(e) SUMMONS. For the purpose of initiating a trans-
fer under this rule a person who appears in response to
a summons issued under Rule 4 shall be treated as if he
had been arrested on a warrant in the district of such
appearance.
RULE 21. TRANSFER FROM THE DISTRICT
FOR TRIAL
(a) FOR PREJUDICE IN THE DISTRICT. The court upon
motion of the defendant shall transfer the proceeding as
to him to another district whether or not such district is
specified in the defendant's motion if the court is satis-
fied that there exists in the district where the prosecu-
tion is pending so great a prejudice against the defendant
that he cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial at any
place fixed by law for holding court in that district.
(b) TRANSFER IN OTHER CASES. For the convenience
of parties and witnesses, and in the interest of justice,
the court upon motion of the defendant may transfer the
proceeding as to him or any one or more of the counts
thereof to another district.
(c) PROCEEDINGS ON TRANSFER. When a transfer is
ordered the clerk shall transmit to the clerk of the court
to which the proceeding is transfered all papers in the
proceeding or duplicates thereof and any bail taken, and
the prosecution shall continue in that district.
RULE 23. TRIAL BY JURY OR BY THE COURT
(c) TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY. In a case tried without
a jury the court shall make a general finding and shall
in addition on request find the facts specially. If an
opinion or memorandum of decision is filed, it will be
sufficient if the findings of fact appear therein.
-Will

RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE.
RULE 24. TRIAL JURORS
325
(c) ALTERNATE JURORS. The court may direct that
not more than 6 jurors in addition to the regular jury be
called and impanelled to sit as alternate jurors. Alter-
nate jurors in the order in which they are called shall
replace jurors who, prior to the time the jury retires to
consider its verdict, become or are found to be unable or
disqualified to perform their duties. Alternate jurors
shall be drawn in the same manner, shall have the same
qualifications, shall be subject to the same examination
and challenges, shall take the same oath and shall have
the same functions, powers, facilities and privileges as
the regular jurors. An alternate juror who does not re-
place a regular juror shall be discharged after the jury
retires to consider its verdict. Each side is entitled to
1 peremptory challenge in addition to those otherwise
allowed by law if 1 or 2 alternate jurors are to be im-
panelled, 2 peremptory challenges if 3 or 4 alternate
jurors are to be impanelled, and 3 peremptory challenges
if 5 or 6 alternate jurors are to be impanelled. The addi-
tional peremptory challenges may be used against an
alternate juror only, and the other peremptory challenges
allowed by these rules may not be used against an
alternate juror.
RULE 25. JUDGE; DISABILITY
(a) DURING TRIAL. If by reason of death, sickness
or other disability the judge before whom a jury trial has
commenced is unable to proceed with the trial, any other
judge regularly sitting in or assigned to the court, upon
certifying that he has familiarized himself with the record
of the trial, may proceed with and finish the trial.
(b) AFTER VERDICT OR FINDING OF GUILT. If by
reason of absence, death, sickness or other disability the
judge before whom the defendant has been tried is un-
able to perform the duties to be performed by the court
200-278 0-66-67

RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE.
326
after a verdict or finding of guilt, any other judge regu-
larly sitting in or assigned to the court may perform
those duties; but if such other judge is satisfied that he
cannot perform those duties because he did not preside
at the trial or for any other reason, he may in his discre-
tion grant a new trial.
RULE 26.1. DETERMINATION OF FOREIGN LAW
A party who intends to raise an issue concerning the
law of a foreign country shall give reasonable written
notice. The court, in determining foreign law, may con-
sider any relevant material or source, including testimony,
whether or not submitted by a party or admissible under
Rule 26. The court's determination shall be treated as
a ruling on a question of law.
RULE 28. EXPERT WITNESSES AND INTERPRETERS
(a) EXPERT WITNESSES. The court may order the
defendant or the government or both to show cause why
expert witnesses should not be appointed, and may re-
quest the parties to submit nominations. The court may
appoint any expert witnesses agreed upon by the parties,
and may appoint witnesses of its own selection. An
expert witness shall not be appointed by the court unless
he consents to act. A witness so appointed shall be in-
formed of his duties by the court in writing, a copy of
which shall be filed with the clerk, or at a conference in
which the parties shall have opportunity to participate.
A witness so appointed shall advise the parties of his
findings, if any, and may thereafter be called to testify
by the court or by any party. He shall be subject to
cross-examination by each party. The court may deter-
mine the reasonable compensation of such a witness and
direct its payment out of such funds as may be provided
by law. The parties also may call expert witnesses of
their own selection.

RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE.
327
(b) INTERPRETERS. The court may appoint an inter-
preter of its own selection and may fix the reasonable
compensation of such interpreter. Such compensation
shall be paid out of funds provided by law or by the gov-
ernment, as the court may direct.
RULE 29. MOTION FOR JUDGMENT OF ACQUITTAL
(a) MOTION BEFORE SUBMISSION TO JURY. Motions
for directed verdict are abolished and motions for judg-
ment of acquittal shall be used in their place. The court
on motion of a defendant or of its own motion shall order
the entry of judgment of acquittal of one or more offenses
charged in the indictment or information after the evi-
dence on either side is closed if the evidence is insuffi-
cient to sustain a conviction of such offense or offenses.
If a defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal at the
close of the evidence offered by the government is not
granted, the defendant may offer evidence without hav-
ing reserved the right.
(b) RESERVATION OF DECISION ON MOTION. If a mo-
tion for judgment of acquittal is made at the close of
all the evidence, the court may reserve decision on the
motion, submit the case to the jury and decide the motion
either before the jury returns a verdict or after it returns
a verdict of guilty or is discharged without having re-
turned a verdict.
(c) MOTION AFTER DISCHARGE OF JURY. If the jury
returns a verdict of guilty or is discharged without hav-
ing returned a verdict, a motion for judgment of acquittal
may be made or renewed within 7 days after the jury
is discharged or within such further time as the court
may fix during the 7-day period. If a verdict of guilty
is returned the court may on such motion set aside the
verdict and enter judgment of acquittal. If no verdict
is returned the court may enter judgment of acquittal.
It shall not be necessary to the making of such a motion
that a similar motion has been made prior to the submis-
sion of the case to the jury.

RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE. 328
RULE 30. INSTRUCTIONS
At the close of the evidence or at such earlier time
during the trial as the court reasonably directs, any party
may file written requests that the court instruct the jury
on the law as set forth in the requests. At the same time
copies of such requests shall be furnished to adverse
parties. The court shall inform counsel of its proposed
action upon the requests prior to their arguments to the
jury, but the court shall instruct the jury after the argu-
ments are completed. No party may assign as error any
portion of the charge or omission therefrom unless he
objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its
verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which he objects
and the grounds of his objection. Opportunity shall be
given to make the objection out of the hearing of the
jury and, on request of any party, out of the presence of
the jury.
RULE 32. SENTENCE AND JUDGMENT
(a) SENTENCE.
(1) IMPOSITION OF SENTENCE. Sentence shall be
imposed without unreasonable delay. Pending sen-
tence the court may commit the defendant or con-
tinue or alter the bail. Before imposing sentence
the court shall afford counsel an opportunity to
speak on behalf of the defendant and shall address.
the defendant personally and ask him if he wishes to
make a statement in his own behalf and to present
any information in mitigation of punishment.
(2) NOTIFICATION OF RIGHT TO APPEAL. After
imposing sentence in a case which has gone to trial
on a plea of not guilty, the court shall advise the
defendant of his right to appeal and of the right of
a person who is unable to pay the cost of an appeal
to apply for leave to appeal in forma pauperis. If
the defendant so requests, the clerk of the court
shall prepare and file forthwith a notice of appeal
on behalf of the defendant.
11

RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE. 329
(c) PRESENTENCE INVESTIGATION.
(2) REPORT. The report of the presentence in-
vestigation shall contain any prior criminal record
of the defendant and such information about his
characteristics, his financial condition and the cir-
cumstances affecting his behavior as may be helpful
in imposing sentence or in granting probation or in
the correctional treatment of the defendant, and
such other information as may be required by the
court. The court before imposing sentence may
disclose to the defendant or his counsel all or part
of the material contained in the report of the pre-
sentence investigation and afford an opportunity to
the defendant or his counsel to comment thereon.
Any material disclosed to the defendant or his
counsel shall also be disclosed to the attorney for
the government.
(f) REVOCATION OF PROBATION. The court shall not
revoke probation except after a hearing at which the
defendant shall be present and apprised of the grounds
on which such action is proposed. The defendant may
be admitted to bail pending such hearing.
RULE 33. NEW TRIAL
The court on motion of a defendant may grant a new
trial to him if required in the interest of justice. If trial
was by the court without a jury the court on motion of
a defendant for a new trial may vacate the judgment if
entered, take additional testimony and direct the entry
of a new judgment. A motion for a new trial based on
the ground of newly discovered evidence may be made
only before or within two years after final judgment, but
if an appeal is pending the court may grant the motion
only on remand of the case. A motion for a new trial
based on any other grounds shall be made within 7 days
after verdict or finding of guilty or within such further
time as the court may fix during the 7-day period.
م

RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE.
RULE 34. ARREST OF JUDGMENT
330
The court on motion of a defendant shall arrest judg-
ment if the indictment or information does not charge an
offense or if the court was without jurisdiction of the
offense charged. The motion in arrest of judgment shall
be made within 7 days after verdict or finding of guilty,
or after plea of guilty or nolo contendere, or within such
further time as the court may fix during the 7-day period.
RULE 35. CORRECTION OR REDUCTION OF
SENTENCE
The court may correct an illegal sentence at any time
and may correct a sentence imposed in an illegal manner
within the time provided herein for the reduction of
sentence. The court may reduce a sentence within 120
days after the sentence is imposed, or within 120 days
after receipt by the court of a mandate issued upon
affirmance of the judgment or dismissal of the appeal, or
within 120 days after entry of any order or judgment of
the Supreme Court denying review of, or having the
effect of upholding, a judgment of conviction. The court
may also reduce a sentence upon revocation of probation
as provided by law.
RULE 37. TAKING APPEAL; AND PETITION
FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI
(a) TAKING APPEAL TO A COURT OF APPEALS.
(1) How AN APPEAL IS TAKEN; NOTICE OF AP-
PEAL. An appeal permitted by law from a district
court to a court of appeals is taken by filing a notice
of appeal in the district court within the time pro-
vided by paragraph (2) of this subdivision. The
notice of appeal shall specify the party or parties
taking the appeal; shall designate the judgment,
order or part thereof appealed from; and shall name
the court to which the appeal is taken. A copy of
the notice of appeal and a statement of the docket

RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE.
331
entries shall be forwarded immediately by the clerk
of the district court to the clerk of the court of
appeals. The clerk shall serve notice of the filing of
a notice of appeal by mailing a copy thereof to all
parties other than the appellant. When an appeal
is taken by a defendant, the clerk shall also serve
a copy of the notice of appeal upon him, either by
personal service or by mail addressed to him. The
clerk shall note on each copy to be served the date
on which the notice of appeal was filed, and shall
note in the docket the names of the parties on whom
he serves copies, with the date of mailing or other
service. Failure of the clerk to serve notice shall
not affect the validity of the appeal.
(2) TIME FOR TAKING APPEAL. The notice of
appeal by a defendant shall be filed within 10 days
after the entry of the judgment or order appealed
from. A notice of appeal filed after the announce-
ment of a decision, sentence or order but before en-
try of the judgment or order shall be treated as filed
after such entry and on the day thereof. If a timely
motion in arrest of judgment or for a new trial on
any ground other than newly discovered evidence
has been made, an appeal from a judgment of con-
viction may be taken within 10 days after the entry
of the order denying the motion. A motion for a
new trial based on the ground of newly discovered
evidence will similarly extend the time for appeal
from a judgment of conviction if the motion is made
before or within 10 days after entry of judgment.
When an appeal by the government is authorized
by statute, the notice of appeal shall be filed within
30 days after entry of the judgment or order ap-
pealed from. A judgment or order is entered within
the meaning of this paragraph when it is entered in
the criminal docket. Upon a showing of excusable
neglect, the district court may, before or after the
time has expired, with or without motion and notice,
1

RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE.
332
extend the time for filing the notice of appeal other-
wise allowed to any party for a period not to exceed
30 days from the expiration of the original time
prescribed by this paragraph.
RULE 38. STAY OF EXECUTION, AND RELIEF
PENDING REVIEW
(a) STAY OF EXECUTION.
(2) IMPRISONMENT. A sentence of imprison-
ment shall be stayed if an appeal is taken and the
defendant is admitted to bail. If the defendant is
not admitted to bail, the court may recommend to
the Attorney General that the defendant be retained
at, or transferred to, a place of confinement near the
place of trial or the place where his appeal is to be
heard, for a period reasonably necessary to permit
the defendant to assist in the preparation of his
appeal to the court of appeals.
RULE 40. COMMITMENT TO ANOTHER
DISTRICT: REMOVAL
(b) ARREST IN DISTANT DISTRICT.
(2) STATEMENT BY COMMISSIONER OR JUDGE.
The commissioner or judge shall inform the defend-
ant of the charge against him, of his right to retain
counsel, of his right to request the assignment of
counsel if he is unable to obtain counsel, and of his
right to have a hearing or to waive a hearing by
signing a waiver before the commissioner or judge.
The commissioner or judge shall also inform the
defendant that he is not required to make a state-
ment and that any statement made by him may be
used against him, shall allow him reasonable oppor-
tunity to consult counsel and shall admit him to bail
as provided in these rules.
RULE 44. RIGHT TO AND ASSIGNMENT OF COUNSEL
(a) RIGHT TO ASSIGNED COUNSEL. Every defendant
who is unable to obtain counsel shall be entitled to have
"'
#

RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE.
333
counsel assigned to represent him at every stage of the
proceedings from his initial appearance before the com-
missioner or the court through appeal, unless he waives
such appointment.
(b) ASSIGNMENT PROCEDURE. The procedures for im-
plementing the right set out in subdivision (a) shall be
those provided by law and by local rules of court estab-
lished pursuant thereto.
RULE 45. Time
(a) COMPUTATION. In computing any period of time
the day of the act or event from which the designated
period of time begins to run shall not be included. The
last day of the period so computed shall be included,
unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday,
in
which event the period runs until the end of the next
day which is not a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday.
When a period of time prescribed or allowed is less than
7 days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays and legal holi-
days shall be excluded in the computation. As used in
these rules, "legal holiday" includes New Year's Day,
Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Independence
Day, Labor Day, Veterans Day, Thanksgiving Day,
Christmas Day, and any other day appointed as a holi-
day by the President or the Congress of the United
States, or by the state in which the district court is held.
(b) ENLARGEMENT. When an act is required or al-
lowed to be done at or within a specified time, the court
for cause shown may at any time in its discretion (1) with
or without motion or notice, order the period enlarged
if request therefor is made before the expiration of the
period originally prescribed or as extended by a previous
order or (2) upon motion made after the expiration of
the specified period permit the act to be done if the fail-
ure to act was the result of excusable neglect; but the
court may not extend the time for taking any action
under Rules 29, 33, 34, 35, 37 (a) (2) and 39 (c), except
to the extent and under the conditions stated in them.

RULES OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE.
RULE 46. RELEASE ON BAIL
334
(c) TERMS. If the defendant is admitted to bail, the
terms thereof shall be such as in the judgment of the
commissioner or court or judge or justice will insure the
presence of the defendant, having regard to the nature
and circumstances of the offense charged, the weight of
the evidence against him, the financial ability of the
defendant to give bail, the character of the defendant,
and the policy against unnecessary detention of defend-
ants pending trial.
(d) FORM, CONDITIONS AND PLACE OF DEPOSIT. A
person required or permitted to give bail shall execute
a bond for his appearance. The commissioner or court
or judge or justice, having regard to the considerations
set forth in subdivision (c), may require one or more
sureties, may authorize the acceptance of cash or bonds
or notes of the United States in an amount equal to or
less than the face amount of the bond, or may authorize
the release of the defendant without security upon his
written agreement to appear at a specified time and place
and upon such conditions as may be prescribed to insure
his appearance. Bail given originally on appeal shall be
deposited in the registry of the district court from which
the appeal is taken.
(h) SUPERVISION OF DETENTION PENDING TRIAL. The
court shall exercise supervision over the detention of
defendants and witnesses within the district pending trial
for the purpose of eliminating all unnecessary detention.
The attorney for the government shall make a biweekly
report to the court listing each defendant and witness
who has been held in custody pending indictment, ar-
raignment or trial for a period in excess of 10 days. As
to each witness so listed the attorney for the government
shall make a statement of the reasons why such witness
should not be released with or without the taking of his
deposition pursuant to Rule 15 (a). As to each defend-
ant so listed the attorney for the government shall make
1

other than those which are heard ex parte, written
notices, designations of record on appeal and similar
papers shall be served upon each of the parties.
(c) NOTICE OF ORDERS. Immediately upon the entry
of an order made on a written motion subsequent to
arraignment the clerk shall mail to each party a notice
thereof and shall make a note in the docket of the mail-
ing. Lack of notice of the entry by the clerk does not
affect the time to appeal or relieve or authorize the court
to relieve a party for failure to appeal within the time
allowed, except as permitted by Rule 37 (a)(2).
RULE 54. APPLICATION AND EXCEPTION
(a) COURTS AND COMMISSIONERS.
(1) COURTS. These rules apply to all criminal

STATEMENT OF DOUGLAS, J.
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, dissenting in part.
I reiterate today what I stated on an earlier occasion
(374 U.S. 865, 869-870) (statement of BLACK and DOUG-
LAS, JJ.), that the responsibility for promulgating Rules
of the kind we send to Congress today should rest with
the Judicial Conference and not the Court. It is the
Judicial Conference, not the Court, which appoints the
Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules which makes the
actual recommendations.¹ Members of the Judicial
128 U. S. C. § 331 (1964 ed.), which establishes the Judicial Con-
ference of the United States, provides that the Conference shall
"carry on a continuous study of the operation and effect of the gen-
eral rules of practice and procedure . . . prescribed by the Supreme
Court. . . ." The Conference has resolved that a standing Com-
mittee on Rules of Practice and Procedure be appointed by the Chief

Conference, being in large part judges of the lower
courts and attorneys who are using the Rules day in and
day out, are in a far better position to make a practical
judgment upon their utility or inutility than we.
But since under the statute 2 the Rules go to Congress
only on the initiative of the Court, I cannot be only a
conduit. I think that placing our imprimatur on the
amendments to the Rules entails a large degree of re-
sponsibility of judgment concerning them. Some of the
criminal Rules which we forward to Congress today are
very bothersome-not in the sense that they may be
unwieldy or unworkable-but in the sense that they
may entrench on important constitutional rights of
defendants.
In my judgment, the amendments to Rule 16 dealing
with discovery require further reflection. To the extent
that they expand the defendant's opportunities for dis-
covery, they accord with the views of a great many com-
mentators who have concluded that a civilized society
ought not to tolerate the conduct of a criminal prosecu-
tion as a "game." 3 But the proposed changes in the
Rule go further. Rule 16 (c) would permit a trial judge
to condition granting the defendant discovery on the
defendant's willingness to permit the prosecution to dis-
cover "scientific or medical reports, books, papers, docu-
ments, tangible objects, or copies or portions thereof"
which (1) are in the defendant's possession; (2) he in-
Justice and that, in addition, five advisory committees be established
to recommend to the Judicial Conference changes in the rules of
practice and procedure for the federal courts. See Annual Report
of the Proceedings of the Judicial Conference of the United States
6-7 (1958).

tends to produce at trial; and (3) are shown to be
material to the preparation of the prosecution's case.*
The extent to which a court may compel the defendant
to disclose information or evidence pertaining to his case
without infringing the privilege against self-incrimina-
tion is a source of current controversy among judges,
prosecutors, defense lawyers, and other legal commenta-
tors. A distinguished state court has concluded-al-
though not without a strong dissent-that the privilege
is not violated by discovery of the names of expert medi-
cal witnesses whose appearance at trial is contemplated
by the defense. 5 I mean to imply no views on the point,
except to note that a serious constitutional question lurks
here.
The prosecution's opportunity to discover evidence in
the possession of the defense is somewhat limited in the
proposal with which we deal in that it is tied to the exer-
cise by the defense of the right to discover from the
prosecution. But if discovery, by itself, of information
in the possession of the defendant would violate the priv-
ilege against self-incrimination, is it any less a violation
if conditioned on the defendant's exercise of the oppor-
tunity to discover evidence? May benefits be condi-
tioned on the abandonment of constitutional rights?
See, e. g., Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398, 403–406. To
deny a defendant the opportunity to discovery—an op-
portunity not withheld from defendants who agree to
prosecutorial discovery or from whom discovery is not
4 The proposed rule explicitly provides that the prosecution may
not discover nonmedical documents or reports "made by the de-
fendant, or his attorneys or agents in connection with the investiga-
tion or defense of the case, or of statements made by the defendant,
or by government or defense witnesses, or by prospective govern-
ment or defense witnesses, to the defendant, his agents or attorneys."

Rptr. 879. See Comment, 51 Calif. L. Rev. 135; Note, 76 Harv. L.
Rev. 838 (1963). The case is more extensively treated in Louisell,

sought merely because the defendant chooses to exer-
cise the constitutional right to refrain from self-incrimi-
nation arguably imposes a penalty upon the exercise of
that fundamental privilege. It is said, however, that
fairness may require disclosure by a defendant who ob-
tains information from the prosecution. Perhaps--but
the proposed rule establishes no such standards. Its
application is mechanical: if the defendant is allowed dis-
covery, so, too, is the prosecution. No requirement is
imposed, for example, that the subject matter of the
material sought to be discovered by the prosecution be
limited to that relating to the subject of the defendant's
discovery.
The proposed addition of Rule 17.1 also suggests diffi-
culties, perhaps of constitutional dimension. This rule
would establish a pretrial conference procedure. The
language of the rule and the Advisory Committee's com-
ments suggest that under some circumstances, the confer-
ence might even take place in the absence of the defend-
ant! Cf. Lewis v. United States, 146 U. S. 370; Fed.
Rules Crim. Proc. Rule 43.
The proposed amendment to Rule 32 (c) (2) states
that the trial judge "may" disclose to the defendant or
his counsel the contents of a presentence report on which
he is relying in fixing sentence. The imposition of sen-
tence is of critical importance to a man convicted of
crime. Trial judges need presentence reports so that they
may have at their disposal the fullest possible informa-
tion. See Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241. But
while the formal rules of evidence do not apply to restrict
the factors which the sentencing judge may consider,
fairness would, in my opinion, require that the defendant
be advised of the facts-perhaps very damaging to him—
on which the judge intends to rely. The presentence
report may be inaccurate, a flaw which may be of consti-
tutional dimension. Cf. Townsend v. Burke, 334 U. S.
736. It may exaggerate the gravity of the defendant's
prior offenses. The investigator may have made an

incomplete investigation. See Tappan, Crime, Justice
and Correction 556 (1960). There may be countervail-
ing factors not disclosed by the probation report. In
many areas we can rely on the sound exercise of discre-
tion by the trial judge; but how can a judge know
whether or not the presentence report calls for a reply
by the defendant? Its faults may not appear on the
face of the document.
Some States require full disclosure of the report to the
defense.6 The proposed Model Penal Code takes the
middle-ground and requires the sentencing judge to dis-
close to the defense the factual contents of the report so
that there is an opportunity to reply." Whatever should
be the rule for the federal courts, it ought not to be one
which permits a judge to impose sentence on the basis
of information of which the defendant may be unaware
and to which he has not been afforded an opportunity to
reply.
I do not think we should approve Rules 16, 17.1, and
32 (c) (2). Instead, we should refer them back to the
Judicial Conference and the Advisory Committee for
further consideration and reflection, where I believe they
were approved only by the narrowest majority.
William O. Douglas.

6 E. g., Calif. Penal Code § 1203.
Model Penal Code § 7.07 (5) (Proposed Official Draft, 1962).
The Code provides that the sources of confidential information need
not be disclosed. "Less disclosure than this hardly comports with
elementary fairness." Comment to § 7.07 (Tent. Draft No. 2, 1954),
at 55. A discarded draft of the amendment to Fed. Rules Crim.
Proc. Rule 32 would have allowed disclosure to defense counsel of
the report, from which the confidential sources would be removed.
A defendant not represented by counsel would be told of the "es-
sential facts" in the report. See 8 Moore's Federal Practice
32.03 [4], 32.09 (1965).

Fifth, and Sixth Amendments as subsumed into the due process pro-
visions of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, because:

of any publication found to be obscene 'shall be prima facie evidence'
that the seller had 'knowledge of the obscene character' of the
publication;
(b) the court below arbitrarily refused to instruct the jury that if
the jury found that the petitioner had a good faith belief that the
publications involved were not obscene, then petitioner was entitled
to an aquittal; and

Petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals
for the Fifth Circuit denied. Dissenting opinion by Mr. Justice
Black:
Now and then the Court refuses to review a case which raises issues
of such great importance that I feel constrained to record my own
belief that the case should be heard. This is one of those cases.
These important issues in the case arose this way:
Upon petition of respondents a United States District Court in
Florida granted an injunction which, among other things, ordered
a number of certain named defendants not to "interfere with, molest,
threaten, intimidate or coerce" Negroes who sought to and used public
accommodations in St. Johns County. The order for injunction also
provided that its prohibitions would be applicable to and enforceable
200-278-66-96

MONDAY, MAY 2, 1966
437
against "any other person to whom notice or knowledge of this Order
may come." Petitioner Lance, a Florida deputy sheriff, duly appointed
by the sheriff of St. Johns County, as authorized by state law, was not
named in the complaint as one of the defendants against whom the
injunction was directed. Shortly after the injunction was entered,
however, an affidavit was filed in the District Court charging that
Lance violated the court's order by following and threatening a Negro
who had tried to register at a local motel. On the afternoon of
Saturday, August 15, Lance was served with an order to show cause
on the following Monday why he should not be punished for contempt.
He did appear, the judge found that he had knowledge of the injunc-
tion, held him guilty of contempt, ordered him to pay $200 fee to the
plaintiff's lawyers, surrender his badge, resign his position as a Florida
deputy sheriff and "no longer act under any color, guise, or pretense
as a law enforcement or peace officer." The Court of Appeals affirmed
the judgment of contempt but modified the order so that Lance was
prohibited from serving as a sheriff only until some later date when
he could satisfy the District Judge that he would in good faith comply
with the terms of the order. 353 F.2d 585.
Lance first contends that the District Judge exceeded his authority
in attempting to make his injunction binding not only on the named
defendants who were parties to the lawsuit but also on all persons who
had notice of the order. This Court, speaking through Mr. Justice
Brandeis, held in Chase National Bank v. Norwalk, 291 U. S. 431, that
it was a violation of "established principles of equity jurisdiction and
procedure" for a court to make its order apply to persons who were not
parties but who merely had notice of the order. See also Kean v.
Hurley, 179 F. 2d 888 (C. A. 8th Cir.). Likewise, Rule 65 (d) Fed.
Rules Civ. Proc. would seem to bar such an order.¹ The summary con-
tempt power of courts is a very limited one and the apparent conflict
between what the court did here and what this Court in Chase said a
district court could not do, is too important to liberty to leave this
judgment standing without review.
The significance of this case, however, does not lie merely in the Dis-
trict Court's questionable assumption of jurisdiction to bind Lance by
its injunction, but it is the manner in which the courts below exercised
the power to punish for contempt that makes this case peculiarly ap-
propriate for review here. The question of the punishment here is
even more important because it is imposed not after a full trial with
all the constitutional Bill of Rights' guarantees but after a summary
1 The rule provides in part that all orders granting injunctions are "binding only upon
the parties to the action, their officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and
upon those persons in active concert or participation with them who receive actual notice
of the order by personal service or otherwise." There was no finding below that Lance
was in any way an agent or was acting in concert with any of the defendants who were
ordered not to intimidate or coerce Negroes.

contempt proceeding in which a single judge lays down the law, prose-
cutes those whom he believes disobey it, passes judgment on the alleged
violations, and finally imposes punishment as he sees fit. See Green v.
United States, 356 U. S. 165, 198 (dissenting opinion).
By ordering this state officer to surrender his badge and resign from
his state office, the District Judge below assumed for the federal
judiciary a new, unprecedented, and, I believe, highly dangerous
power. To give federal judges such authority seems not only com-
pletely out of place in our federal form of government but it at least
comes perilously close to violating the constitutional obligation of
the Federal Government to guarantee to every State a republican
form of government. Subjecting a state official's tenure of office to the
discretion of the federal judiciary makes state officers responsible not
to the people of the State but instead to federal judges who, accord-
ing to the holding here, may oust them from their state office without
even so much as a simple notice to the State whose officers they are.
I cannot help but believe that the legislators who passed the 1964
Civil Rights Act will be greatly surprised if not shocked to learn that
by passage of that law they empowered federal judges to remove state
officers without even giving these impeached officers a trial by jury.
Federal courts have heretofore been reluctant to exercise equity
powers to interfere with a State's governmental operations. See,
e.g., Douglas v. Jeannette, 319 U.S. 157 (refusal to enjoin criminal
prosecutions); Walton v. House of Representatives, 265 U.S. 487
(refusal to enjoin the removal of state official from office). No reason
is given by the courts below for not respecting the authority of a
State to conduct its governmental operations by agents responsible
to the people of the State. There is no suggestion that the traditional
remedies for contempt are inadequate in this case. And no one claims
that this new federal-judge power to remove state officers is necessary
to enforce the salutary provisions of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. It is
clear that the judge's order here provides complete protection to the
plaintiff's rights without that part compelling the State's deputy
sheriff to hold his job at the pleasure of the United States judges.
I regret that the Court refuses to review this case in order to make
it clear to all the people just how far this new contempt power of
federal judges goes. Here it is only an appointed deputy sheriff that
is removed from office, but if this new contempt enforcement power is
legal I can think of no reason why it cannot be used against more im-
portant state officials whether elected or appointed. If federal judges
can remove sheriffs why not members of the state legislatures, state
judges, and why not even state governors? In considering the im-
portance of this power to remove state officers, it is highly relevant
that this new power jeopardizes not merely officers in a few States,

MONDAY, MAY 2, 1966
439
but threatens every state officer in every State from Florida to Alaska,
from Maine to California and Hawaii. In order to protect the rights
of citizens to vote in state elections this Court recently announced the
constitutional principle of "one person, one vote." It seems a little
early to graft onto that principle a new one giving United States
judges the power to remove state officials chosen by the people in strict
accordance with the "one person, one vote" principle.

Mr. Solicitor General Marshall addressed the Court as follows:
"Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:
"A meeting of the Bar of the Supreme Court was held at 11:00 this
morning in honor of the memory of Mr. Justice Sherman Minton.
Dean Leon H. Wallace of the School of Law of Indiana University
was selected as chairman of the Resolutions Committee, and Honor-
able John F. Davis was selected as secretary of that meeting.
"The resolutions unanimously adopted are as follows:
""RESOLUTIONS
""On behalf of the Bar of the Supreme Court, we have met to
record our respect and our regard for Sherman Minton, Justice of
the Supreme Court of the United States for seven years from 1949 to
1956. His death on April 9, 1965, has saddened the members of the
profession, his friends, and those others everywhere who admired him.
""Sherman Minton was born October 20, 1890, in the hill hamlet
of Georgetown, Indiana, near the winding Ohio River across from
1

MONDAY, MAY 2, 1966
441
Louisville, Kentucky. It was a region of great natural beauty but
little prosperity. John Minton, the father of Sherman, had known a
boyhood made destitute by the death of his own father as a Union
soldier, who left a widow and five small children, of whom the baby
John was the youngest. When John married Emma Lyvers, the
young couple had no worldly goods, and the total of their formal
schooling was but five years.
""John and Emma Lyvers Minton became the parents of four chil-
dren, a daughter Ivy, and three sons, Herbert, Sherman and Roscoe.
John Minton earned a living as a marginal farmer and as a laborer on
the Air Line Railroad. In this latter employment, he suffered a sun-
stroke from which he never entirely recovered. Within the next year,
when Sherman Minton was a boy of nine, his mother died of cancer.
""A few years later, the older brother, Herbert, went to Fort Worth,
Texas. Sherman had continued in school through the eighth grade.
With boundless energy, more mischief than most, but with some inner
compulsion to learn, he went through the eighth grade again, not
because he had to, but because there was no place else to go.
""Shortly after this, Sherman, eventually his father and the other
children also migrated to Texas to join Herbert. There Sherman,
who had been earning money in any available job since he was eight
years old, worked for Swift and Company, trimming neckbones and
carrying boxes. He saved his meager wages in order to return to
New Albany, in the county of his birthplace, and finish high school.
"After further work and saving, he entered Indiana University,
where among his student friends were Paul Vories McNutt and Lewis
Wendell Willkie. While he studied, he also worked, and played
varisity football and baseball, sports in which he retained a great
interest throughout his life. In 1915, he received his Bachelor of
Laws degree, first in his class, and with highest distinction.
""Awarded a major scholarship by the Association of American
Law Schools, he went on to Yale Law School, studying constitutional
law under a former President and future Chief Justice, William
Howard Taft. He received his Master of Laws degree with distinc-
tion in 1916. While at Yale he helped found the Yale Legal Aid
Society. During the year, he had questioned the soundness of a deci-
sion upholding the confiscation of nets owned by fishermen convicted
of seining in navigable waters. Professor Taft concluded the discus-
sion by remarking, “I'm afraid, Mr. Minton, that if you don't like the
way this law has been interpreted, you will have to get on the Supreme
Court and change it."
"At the end of summer, 1916, Minton started to practice law in
New Albany, but in May, 1917, went to Officers Training Camp at
Fort Benjamin Harrison, near Indianapolis, and received his captain's

MONDAY, MAY 2, 1966
442
commission in due course. On August 11, 1917, after almost ten years
of courtship, he married his high school sweetheart, Gertrude Gurtz.
"In July 1918, he went to France with the 84th Division. De-
tached from his Division, he was assigned to do general staff work in
and near the Argonne Forest. After the Armistice he was transferred
to the 33rd Division.
""While he was in France, his wife had returned to live with rela-
tives in New Albany, where in the spring of 1919, their first son,
Sherman, was born.
"For several months after the Armistice, Captain Minton had the
opportunity to take special law courses in the Faculté de Droit at the
Sorbonne in Paris, studying International Law, Roman Law, Civil
Law and Jurisprudence under internationally known French teachers.
He was at Versailles on June 28, 1919, when the Versailles Treaty was
signed. He returned to the United States and was discharged in the
fall of 1919.
""Before re-entering the practice of law, he ran for the Democratic
nomination for Congress in his district, in early 1920, but was de-
feated.
""Minton's sense of humor included an ability to laugh at himself.
One of his favorite anecdotes concerned an early client, a pauper,
charged with a serious crime, whom the local judge had appointed
young Minton to defend. He had a long interview with his client
at the jail on the afternoon before the day the case was set for trial.
After the interview, the client brooded over the problem of whether
to put his life in the hands of this energetic young lawyer, or to place
his trust and confidence elsewhere. That night, he broke jail and
escaped.
""Some two years later, the firm of Stotsenberg, Weathers and
Minton was created in New Albany. Stotsenberg was a former state
attorney general, and Weathers had earned the reputation of being
an excellent jury lawyer. During the next three years, Sherman
Minton became known as an outstanding trial lawyer. During these
years Mrs. Minton gave birth to a daughter, Mary Anne, and another
son, John.
66
'Restless, however, as a small town lawyer, Minton in 1925 accepted
an offer to become associated with the firm of Shutts and Bowen, in
Miami, Florida, and became a partner the following January. He
handled the bulk of the firm's trial work. In those years, Miami was
a bustling boom town, but both Minton and his family were dissatis-
fied with it, and with living conditions in general. With the defla-
tion of the land speculation already apparent, the Mintons returned
to New Albany in 1928, and he rejoined his former partners.
"In 1930, Minton was again defeated for the Democratic nomina-
tion for Congress. Shortly after this, he joined a group of fellow

MONDAY, MAY 2, 1966
443
Legionnaires to promote the candidacy for the governorship of Indi-
ana of his old college friend, Paul V. McNutt, then dean of Indiana
University School of Law, who had served as both State Commander
and National Commander of the American Legion.
"After McNutt's election to the governorship in 1932, he asked
Minton to serve in the newly created post of Public Counselor of the
Public Service Commission of Indiana, which involved representing
the consuming public in matters concerning public utilities. Minton
accepted. Being monopolies, the utilities had not moved to reduce
their rates to correspond with the general price decline of the de-
pression years.
""Instead of attempting to prove that utility rates were too high,
Minton asked the Commission to require the utilities to show cause
why their rates should not be reduced. The Commission complied.
Thereafter, the utilities negotiated rate reductions with the state ad-
ministration, which culminated in savings to the consuming public of
more than $3,000,000 annually. For this, McNutt was careful to give
Minton public credit.
“'In 1934, with considerable administration support, Minton re-
ceived the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate on
the fourth ballot of the state convention. His opponent in the elec-
tion was the incumbent, Arthur Robinson. After a spirited campaign,
Minton was elected to the United States Senate by a majority of
60,000.
66
'Early in 1935, Sherman and Gertrude Minton and their three
children, now aged 15, 11, and 9, went to Washington. Among his
new companions and friends were Senate Majority Leader Joe
Robinson of Arkansas, Senator Byrnes, Senator Borah, Senator
Norris, and another newcomer, who occupied the seat next to him for
six years, Harry S. Truman.
"In the Senate, Sherman Minton was a partisan, an advocate,
and fought hard and effectively for the often mist-shrouded, but never-
theless discernible goals of the New Deal. Reared on Populism and
poverty, to him these goals were the legitimate ends of government,
operating under a Constitution, to serve the people, not to enslave
them.
"However, Minton had some misgivings. As a member of the
Senate committee considering what became the Bituminous Coal Con-
servation Act, he expressed doubt, in one of the public hearings, of its
constitutionality, in the light of recent Supreme Court decisions. His
appraisal brought forth nothing by heavy silence from John L. Lewis,
who was present. Nevertheless, when the bill reached the floor of
the Senate, Minton advocated its passage with his customary energy.
..
"

MONDAY, MAY 2, 1966
444
In the following year, this act was declared unconstitutional, as
Minton's earlier analysis had foretold.
"With equal vigor, he defended farm and labor programs, and
other social reforms which thrust government into economic affairs.
His political philosophy on these matters was expressed years later,
after his retirement, in defending federal aid to education, when he
asked: "After all, what is government but we, the people?"
"His position on the National Labor Relations Act and other labor
legislation could never have been in doubt. He accepted "big manage-
ment" as a fact, and did not try to break it up. He advocated rather
a countervailing power to be exercised fairly on labor's side.
"He supported strongly President Roosevelt's proposal to reform
the Supreme Court in 1937, which came to an inconclusive end-
possibly a victory for both sides. Shortly afterward, Senator Minton
referred good-humoredly to "the Constitution of 1937 and not the
Constitution of 1936."
"'He served first as a member, later as chairman, of a five man Lobby
Investigating Committee to consider, among other things, matters
which led to legislation requiring the dissolution of public utility
holding companies whose existence could not economically be justi-
fied. Here he encountered his old law school friend, Wendell Willkie,
whose name, in the intervening years, had been slightly changed;
whose political philosophy had been more than slightly changed;
and whose subsequent candidacy for the Presidency in 1940 would
contribute greatly to Minton's defeat for reelection to the Senate.
66
'This investigation of lobbying practices, and the tendency of some
newspapers to publish propaganda of doubtful accuracy as a fact,
particularly in the fight against the utility holding company bill,
brought about a bitter clash between the Committee, enthusiastically
led by Minton, and the nation's press. Minton came out second best,
but undismayed. For this, some of the press never forgave him.
""The likelihood of defeat, however, never inhibited Senator Minton
from supporting what he thought was right. In advocating a federal
anti-lynching bill, he said, "I am interested in State rights; but I am
much more interested in human rights."
""He served effectively for a time as assistant Democratic Whip
in the Senate; and upon the death of Senator Lewis of Illinois, Minton
was chosen to succeed him as the Whip.
66
'In his last year in the Senate, he was engrossed more and more
with the impending danger of the involvement of this country in war.
He was increasingly concerned about the danger of "fifth-columnists",
and supported the Smith Act. He also advocated preparedness, and
the Selective Service Act, positions which did not endear him to
many of his Indiana constituents.

MONDAY, MAY 2, 1966
445
"'Whereas in 1934, Minton's opponent had in effect been compelled
to run against Franklin Roosevelt, in 1940, the tables were turned,
and Minton was forced to run against Wendell Willkie. As a result,
both Willkie and Minton's opponent, Raymond Willis, publisher of a
small town newspaper in the northeast corner of the state, carried
Indiana on November 5 by about 25,000 votes.
""Out of a job, Minton accepted Roosevelt's offer in January, 1941,
to be one of five special administrative assistants to the President.
His principal duty was to serve as a liaison between the President
and the Democratic leaders of the Senate. However, he never became
a close confidant of the President. Perhaps his most significant con-
tribution in that post grew out of a conference with Senator Byrnes
concerning the choice among three proposed resolutions calling for an
investigation of defense plants. The importance of the selection lay
in the fact that the sponsor of the resolution recommended would be
chairman of the new committee created. Senator Truman's resolu-
tion was agreed on, and Minton wrote a memorandum to the Presi-
dent recommending administration support for it, to which the Presi-
dent agreed. After the election of 1944, Minton sent Truman a copy
of his 1941 memorandum with his own personal note: "Here's how
Vice Presidents are made."
"'In May 1941, after serving only slightly more than four months,
Minton took a memorandum to the President's desk one afternoon,
delivered it, and after a brief conversation, turned away to leave, when
the President stopped him, and asked, casually, "By the way, Shay,
would you be interested in that vacancy in the Seventh Circuit?"
""In a few days, his appointment to the federal court was approved
by the Senate without controversy.
""The Mintons returned to New Albany, where they bought a beau-
tiful home in Silver Hills. This house, high above the Ohio River,
was to remain the family home throughout the years. Judge Minton
rented an apartment in Chicago, making the long trip home as a
commuter on many week ends.
""During the next eight years, Judge Minton wrote more than two
hundred opinions for the Court.
""One group of cases in which he participated involved the applica-
tion of the Sherman Act. The difficulty in deciding these was largely
in applying the proscriptions of the Act against alleged combinations
for price-fixing. Sometimes, the greatest problem was the formula-
tion of an appropriate remedy to break up the tainted combination,
to strip the offenders of their wrongful profits, and to restore free
competition. Judge Minton carefully spelled out what the courts
were trying to do, when he observed: "The decree may very properly
be used to destroy the conspiracy, root, branch, and all its evil fruits,
but it may not be used to redress the economic balance between the

MONDAY, MAY 2, 1966
446
plaintiffs and the said defendant without a finding that the difference
was related directly to the conspiracy. *** The plaintiffs have a
right to compete for any playing position, but they have no right to
be awarded and protected by decree in any certain position."
""More interesting and revealing was a series of opinions he wrote
involving the problems of price discrimination, specifically outlawed
by the Clayton Act and the amendments embodied in the Robinson-
Patman Act. Here again the difficulty was the proper application of
the law to the particular facts. As Judge Minton learned in connec-
tion with his last opinion on this subject in the Court of Appeals, that
proper application was what five Justices of the Supreme Court found
it to be.
"'In Labor Board cases, Minton was willing to give the Board con-
siderable latitude, but on occasion, he reminded the Board, as he did
other administrative agencies, that: "We recognize the exclusive right
of the Board to draw inferences, but there must be some evidence from
which the inference can be drawn."
"His record in various aspects of civil rights was clear and con-
sistent. Freedom of speech must be balanced against other competing
rights. Searches and seizures must be truly unreasonable to invoke
the protection of the Fourth Amendment. Guilt must be based on
more than a "robust suspicion."
"His opinions in the Court of Appeals were clear sometimes dry
analyses of the facts and the applicable law-not necessarily the law
as he thought it ought to be, but as he thought it was.
66
'One bright, warm day in mid-September, 1949, Judge Minton,
relaxed in his favorite chair on the front porch of his home in Silver
Hills, was peacefully reading, resting after a trying year on the Court,
and enjoying the interlude at home before the time came to return
to Chicago. He was called to the telephone. A crisp voice greeted
him, and, without further preliminaries, asked him if he would con-
sent to having his name sent to the Senate for “that vacancy on the
Court." The voice was that of the President of the United States.
""By virtue of the "special trust and confidence" placed in him by
President Truman, Sherman Minton took his place on the Supreme
Court of the United States on October 12, 1949.
"Mr. Justice Minton brought to the Court those qualities of in-
tegrity and industry which had characterized his life. The dour
judicial face, assumed on the bench and for official portraits, gave
little hint of the delightful story-teller, the man of great warmth and
deep compassion. He had fought for everything he advocated. From
boyhood he had striven to gain the knowledge and competence which
had brought him to this place. He had an abiding faith in the people
and a belief that government is "We, the people," but he had also a
3

MONDAY, MAY 2, 1966
447
firm conviction that it must be a government of law, which the people
through their representatives had created, and which it was his task
to help to interpret and apply.
"In considering the problems of federal regulation of business,
Mr. Justice Minton stressed the literal language of the particular
statute, and gave little weight to outside considerations bearing on
the intent of Congress. He was reluctant to nullify state regulation
of local incidents of interstate commerce, unless the state regulation
clearly conflicted with the federal one, or unless Congress had made
it unmistakably plain that it intended to occupy the field.
"For him, picketing was one form of communication protected
by the Constitution as freedom of speech, but he was inclined to allow
the states considerable power to restrain picketing in order to preserve
other public policies which they recognized as important.
"He adhered to traditional views in respect to the general lack of
power of the states to tax interstate commerce and federal instrumen-
talities.
"'In criminal cases, also, he stressed a literal interpretation of un-
ambiguous language, while insisting that criminal statutes should be
construed strictly in favor of the defendant. As to procedural defects,
Justice Minton's position was: “A defendant is entitled to a fair trial
but not a perfect one."
""However, where aliens were concerned, he wrote: “*** what-
ever the procedure authorized by Congress is, it is due process as far
as an alien denied entry is concerned." Where the question involved
deportation of an alien criminal, he observed, in dissent: "I know of
no good reason why we should by strained construction of an Act
compel the United States to cling on to alien criminals."
"'In labor cases, his concern was more for a strict interpretation of
expressed Congressional intent than for an effort to formulate desir-
able policy by way of judicial construction. But he urged that: "An
employer may not stake out an area which is a proper subject of bar-
gaining and say, 'As to this, we will not bargain.' *** If employees'
bargaining rights can be cut away so easily, they are indeed illusory.”
'In general, he deferred to administrative interpretations based
upon experience and expert knowledge, but objected to changes in
those interpretations when the earlier ones had been relied on. How-
ever, he was not impressed by an administrative construction of par-
ticular statutory provisions where there could be reasonable differences
of opinion concerning Congressional intent.
66
""He joined in the plurality opinion which upheld the conviction of
the “first string" of the American Communist Party on evidence
which supported the finding that the defendants were involved in a
closely knit conspiracy to overthrow the Government by force when-
ever there appeared to be a reasonable chance to do so, in violation of

MONDAY, MAY 2, 1966
448
the Smith Act, for which he had voted as a Senator. But when Penn-
sylvania's statute prohibiting conspiracies to overthrow the state or
federal government was found to be invalid insofar as it concerned
conspiracies against the federal government, he joined the dissent to
the Court's opinion which held that Congressional action in that situa-
tion had pre-empted the field.
"'In the first of these cases, Justic Minton supported the power of
the Federal government to restrict individual freedom; in the second,
he demonstrated his preference for recognizing state power unless it
had clearly been barred by Congressional action. His positions in
these cases reflected his attitudes on a number of others, in some of
which he wrote the Court's opinion.
""He was one of the unanimous Court holding racial segregation in
primary and secondary schools unconstitutional. He wrote for the
Court in holding unconstitutional a state court's award of contract
damages for violation of a racially restrictive covenant.
""To Justice Minton, most of these great constitutional issues which
came before the Court involved the delicate balancing of power exer-
cised by the government-the determination of which of conflicting
concepts should prevail. As one commentator, who had for him a deep
respect and affection, has put it:
"Justice Minton made perfectly plain his position with respect to
these problems of power. That many disagree is not surprising in
view of the importance of the conflicting considerations competing for
supremacy. *** In his admirable desire to maintain consistency in
the law, and his resulting heavy reliance on prior authority, he may
have occasionally thwarted natural judicial developments justified by
changing conditions in a dynamic world. Nevertheless, in his reso-
lution of the problems of power, and in his recognition of limitations
on the power of the Court itself, his overall performance was com-
mendable. ***"
"By 1956, the pernicious anemia which had plagued him since it
first struck him down in 1943 had progressed to the point where it
affected his physical balance, and he feared it would diminish his pro-
ductive capacity on the Court. Late in the summer of 1956, he an-
nounced his retirement.
"He and Mrs. Minton returned once more to Silver Hills. Retire-
ment gave him more time for friends and family, and for enjoying the
grandchildren whose presence brought always happiness and delight.
""On occasion he visited Indiana University, where he had been
named Professorial Lecturer in Law.
"'In 1959, the Mintons traveled around the world, a trip highlighted
by a visit to their son and his family in Pakistan where Sherman,
Jr., a doctor and professor of medicine, was taking part in a medical

MONDAY, MAY 2, 1966
449
research project. Though his health was deteriorating, he neverthe-
less kept in correspondence with his many friends until a few days
before his death.
""To the end, he remained true to his fiercely held democratic ideal.
It would be untruthful to say that he had ever belonged to one bloc or
another he was always Sherman Minton.
"'It is accordingly fitting and proper that we members of the bar
of the Court should submit the following resolutions.
""We do
"Resolve that we, the bar of the Supreme Court of the United
States, express our deep sorrow at the death of Justice Sherman
Minton, and our grateful appreciation for his long years of public
service, as an officer in the armed forces, and in high positions in the
Executive, Legislative and Judicial branches of his State and National
governments, culminating with his work as a Justice of the Supreme
Court, always forthright and incapable of guile or deceit.
"It is further Resolved
""That the Solicitor General be asked to present these Resolutions
to the Court, and to ask that they be inscribed upon its permanent

Maryland, and John E. Minton, of Washington, D.C.'”
Mr. Attorney General Katzenbach addressed the Court as follows:
"Mr. Chief Justice, May It Please the Court:
"The Bar of this Court assembled this morning to honor the mem-
ory of Sherman Minton, whose seven distinguished terms as an As-
sociate Justice of this Court culminated a lifetime of devoted service
to his State and Nation. On this Court, as in the other positions of
trust he occupied during his notable career, his work evinced the
skillful lawyer's pride in mastering the tools of his profession and
the conscientious public servant's zeal to fulfill to the utmost
his particular role in society. Combined with these admirable pro-
fessional virtues were the engaging charm, the ready cordiality and the
rich personal warmth so familiar to all who knew him.
"Justice Minton's legal talent and public consciousness became
evident at an early date. He graduated first in his class, with an
LL.B. degree, from Indiana University and was awarded a schol-
arship to Yale Law School, where he received the degree of Master
of Laws. While a student at Yale, he not only distinguished him-
self academically, but also demonstrated his deep sense of civic duty
by helping to establish the Yale University Legal Aid Society for the

Poor. After serving with honor as a captain in the Infantry during
World War I, he returned to Indiana, where he engaged in a highly suc-
cessful private practice until he was called up to serve as the first
Public Counselor of his State's Public Service Commission. Although
the temptations to remain in private practice were great, Sherman
Minton did not hesitate to answer the call and, undertaking his chal-
lenging assignment with characteristic vigor, he achieved remarkable
success.
"Serving in a variety of governmental positions during his career,
he was constantly aware of the distinct functions he was called upon
to perform in each, and he seduously tailored his performance to its
demands. As a United States Senator, he did not shrink from con-
troversy; he took full advantage of the educational potentialities of
legislative investigations and public pronouncements. Yet, as an
administrative assistant to President Roosevelt, it was what the
President called his 'passion for anonymity' that made him effec-
tive. And, finally, as a judge on the United States Court of Ap-
peals for the Seventh Circuit and an Associate Justice of this Court,
he confined his official conduct to the sphere which he considered
appropriate to the judicial role and accorded great deference to the
decisions of the legislative and executive branches when made within
the bounds of their legitimate powers. As the draftsman and sup-
porter of legislation and the formulator of govermental policy, Sher-
man Minton was forceful and inventive; as the interpreter of statutes
and the overseer of executive action, Mr. Justice Minton was circum-
spect, impartial, in a word, judicious.
"Throughout his career, Justice Minton displayed ardor for social
reform through legislative action. While serving as Indiana's Public
Counselor, he was responsible for writing much of the progressive
legislation that characterized that State's so-called 'Little New Deal.'
And as assistant majority whip during most of his tenure in the Senate,
he fought vigorously for the enactment of President Roosevelt's pro-
grams. His efforts in the Senate to curtail filibusters and to shed light
on the operations of congressional lobbyists reflected his profound
belief in the importance of an untrammelled legislative process.
Again, his many opinions for this Court involving issues of statutory
interpretation reflect his high regard for the role of the legislature in
a representative democracy.
"Thus, as a judge, he scrupulously refrained from injecting his own
predilections into his interpretation of congressional enactments. 'It
is not necessary for us to justify the policy of Congress,' he wrote in
an early opinion: 'It is enough that we find it in the statute.' 2 Never
ignoring legislative history, he placed primary reliance on the natural

connotation of the statutory words and was loath to discard any
statutory language as meaningless. His last opinion for the Court ³ is
illustrative. Taking cognizance of the remedial purposes of the
amendment extending the coverage of the Federal Employers' Liabil-
ity Act to 'any employees *** any part of whose duties *** shall
be the furtherance of interstate * ** commerce,' Justice Minton
refused to restrict the natural meaning of these words so as to exclude
a clerical employee whose job was of substantial importance in the
functioning of the respondent's railroad.
"As attentive as he was to the role of the judiciary vis-à-vis the
legislature, he was likewise deeply conscious of the courts' relation to
administrative and law enforcement agencies. He readily deferred to
administrative agencies in matters relegated to their expert considera-
tion. But, as his opinion for the Court in the Phillips Petroleum case *
demonstrates, he did not give nearly so much weight to the agencies'
construction of congressional enactments, a task which he considered
more properly one for the courts. In resolving the inevitable conflicts
between the needs of law enforcement agencies and the interests of the
individual, Justice Minton's approach was essentially a pragmatic
one to strike a fair and workable balance. In a case involving the
delicate question of the permissible scope of a search incident to a law-
ful arrest, he concluded that '[s] ome flexibility [must] be accorded
law officers engaged in daily battle with criminals for whose restraint
criminal laws are essential.' 5 Unless the government's legitimate needs
were of sufficient strength, however, he steadfastly refused-as in
Bowman Dairy, for example-to limit the protections available to the
accused.
6
"In these decisions and the many others he wrote, both for the Court
and in dissent, Justice Minton clearly revealed his craftsmanship in
the art of adjudication. He was at pains to separate predispositions
from the decision-making process; indeed on occasion he noted his
personal distaste for the actions of parties in whose favor he felt con-
strained to decide. He had a strong sense of the law's continuity and
always made prominent reference in his opinions to the prior decisions
by which he was guided. When he believed that the Court had de-
parted from controlling precedents, he did not hesitate to voice his
disagreement in lucid and forceful dissent. His writing style was
clear and direct, and his opinions were organized to march.
"Displaying these marks of high professional skill, Justice Minton's
opinions contributed to the development of the law in many and
diverse fields. A prominent example of his skill and of his abiding

devotion to justice is his carefully reasoned opinion in Barrows v.
Jackson. There he resolved a difficult question of standing on a
practical, as well as logical, basis and forthrightly rejected a last-ditch
attempt to enforce racially restrictive covenants in the courts.
"Last year, after a debilitating illness which forced him to retire.
from the Bench at the beginning of the 1956 Term, Justice Minton
died at age of seventy-four. We mourn his passing. But all of us,
and particularly those to whom he was closest, find comfort in these
lines composed by James Whitcomb Riley, poet of Justice Minton's
native Indiana:
Who lives for you and me―
Lives for the world he tries
To help he lives eternally.
A good man never dies.
"May it please this Honorable Court: In the name of the lawyers
of this Nation, and particularly of the Bar of this Court, I respectfully
request that the resolution presented to you in memory of the late
Justice Sherman Minton be accepted by you, and that it, together
with the chronicle of these proceedings, be ordered kept for all time
in the records of this court."
The Chief Justice said:
"MR. ATTORNEY GENERAL:
"The Court appreciates and thanks you for the recognition you
have given to the character and accomplishments of our late Brother,
Sherman Minton. While we are sitting today in the presence of the
Bar of this Court in solemn ceremonies to his memory, your felicitous
remarks concerning his devotion to duty stir deep and happy mem-
ories of our fraternal relationship with him.
"He was the eighty-seventh Justice of this Court, and five of us
here today had the pleasure of sitting with him during his tenure. I
venture to say that of the ninety-five Justices who have sat on this
Court, none could be found to have more genuine qualities than those
which inspired him during his long and purposeful lifetime or more
life experiences flowing from faithful public service than those which
went to make up the dedicated Shay Minton, as he was affectionately
addressed by us and by all who knew him from his childhood days.
The nickname, Shay, came from the inability of his baby brother
to pronounce the name, Sherman. This brotherly, shorthand version
of Sherman remained with him throughout his life in all circles close
to him and on all occasions where formalities could properly be relaxed
in favor of affectionate regard.
"This can be said of him without contradiction. He came to his
eminent position and made his contribution to the nation through
7 346 U.S. 249.

strength of character, laudable ambition, and a resoluteness that could
not be weakened by either hardship or temporary failure.
"He was born in a humble two-room cottage in the countryside of
Indiana on the banks of the Ohio River. He was orphaned by the
death of his young mother at the age of nine years, and because of ad-
versity he was taken to Texas by his widower father in order to reunite
the family with his older brother who was living in that State. Even
at that early age, while in elementary school, he worked at odd jobs
to supplement the meagre family income, but always with the longing
to return to Indiana to attend high school at New Albany.
"By persistence, he gratified that desire and became the outstanding
student of his class, the leading athlete of the school and its champion
debater. At the University of Indiana, he pursued his aim to become
a lawyer, and in addition to earning extra money by waiting on table
in his fraternity house, he was an outstanding fullback on the Varsity
Football Team, a stellar Varsity baseball player, and again the cham-
pion debater. He graduated magna cum laude and first in his class,
thereby earning a scholarship at Yale University. There he received
his Master of Laws Degree cum laude with distinguished awards in
oratory.
"In that same Summer, he married his high school sweetheart, Ger-
trude Gurtz, his lifelong partner and inspiration.
"From that time on, with few interruptions, he served his State and
Nation throughout his lifetime. As a Captain of Infantry in the Ar-
gonne and at Verdun in World War I; as Public Utilities Counselor
of Indiana; as United States Senator from Indiana; as Presidential
Assistant to President Franklin D. Roosevelt; as a Judge of the
Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit for eight years, and then
as a Justice of this Court for seven years, he made a contribution to
American life throughout two World Wars, the Great Depression, and
the post-war Readjustment Period comparable to that of any man of
his day.
"All of his life he was a competitor-almost a fierce competitor. It
was his principal weapon for success. He had a stern exterior but he
was a gentle soul. Having experienced adversity and hardship dur-
ing his youth, he had compassion for all who were similarly situated.
To his dying day, he believed that Government is designed to relieve
such undeserved distress as far as possible. Justice Minton played
the game of life as he played the game of football. He hit the line
hard. He played according to the rules. He was a sportsman at
heart.
"He frankly admitted to partisanship when partisanship was the
order of the day, but he disavowed that attribute when he was called
upon to judge. In a letter to the Committee on the Judiciary of the

MONDAY, MAY 2, 1966
454
United States Senate, when it was considering his appointment to the
Supreme Court, he wrote in part as follows:
""When I was a young man playing baseball and football I strongly
supported my team. I was then a partisan. But later when I refereed
games I had no team, I had no side. The same is true when I left the
political arena and assumed the bench. Cases must be decided under
applicable law and upon the record as to where the right lies. I have
never approached a case except to try to find the answer in the law to
the question presented on the record before me.'
"As an evidence of the difficulty which any man has when leaving
one era of his life and entering another with all the nostalgic mem-
ories which he has of former days, this story, perhaps apocryphal,
but at least indicative of the frankness of Justice Minton, was told
in our intimate circle. It was said that on his return to Washington
to take his seat on the Court, in order to see the faces of old friends
and again shake their hands, he attended a Jackson Day Dinner.
When asked by someone on the Court if he didn't think it might be
embarrassing to attend a political gathering of that kind, he said
with a twinkle in his eye, 'What is political about the Democratic
Party?'
"Shay Minton with friends always had a quick retort which prob-
ably stemmed from his high school and college debating days. He
always had a cheerful note to enliven serious moments and more often
than otherwise a lively story to illustrate his point. Even while suf-
fering from the illness which eventually caused his retirement, he
always had a cheerful note in Conference and at our luncheon table.
"Totally without guile and with absolute honesty of expression, he
wrote for the Court or in dissent so that no one could be misled by
what he said. This is not the time to elaborate on his judicial opin-
ions. They were many and are recorded in Volumes 338 through 352
of the United States Reports and in Volumes 119 through 175 of
the Federal Reporter, 2d Series. In the years he sat on this Court
and on the Court of Appeals, his opinions, in the aggregate, constitute
a significant segment of American jurisprudence. They are there to be
read and conjured with as long as the Supreme Court is a vital force
in American life.
"We enjoyed Justice Minton as a colleague; we cherished him as a
friend; and we admired him as a dedicated public servant. We honor
his memory and, in this formal manner, Mr. Attorney General, we
thank you and the members of the Bar of this Court for doing likewise.
"Your remarks and the Resolutions of the Bar will be spread upon
the Minutes of the Court."
Adjourned until Monday, May 16, 1966, at 10 o'clock.

No. 980. Joe Davis, petitioner, v. United States. Petition for writ
of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit denied. Dissenting opinion by Mr. Justice Stewart:
"The petitioner stands convicted for sending two alledgedly obscene
phonograph records through the mail.¹ One of the records consists
almost entirely of the sounds of percussion instruments. Its title
"Erotica," is a gross misnomer. The second record is a transcription
of passages from "Songs of Bilitis," a book of poems published by
Pierre Louys in 1894. Pierre Louys was a French poet and novelist
who lived from 1870 to 1925. The Columbia Dictionary of Modern
European Literature 2 says that his poems "by their grace, by that clear
imagery characteristic of the Parnassian school, and by their pure
and flexible harmony of style may well become immortal; indeed few
poets have ever had a more fervent worship of beauty and a more pro-
found respect for form. The works of Louys have inspired several
musicians, among whom the most notable is Claude Debussy..
"
"Under the First Amendment this conviction cannot stand. I
would grant certiorari and reverse the judgment."
MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS joins this dissent, adding that he would also
reverse on the basis of his separate opinions in Ginzburg v. United
States, 383 U.S. 463, and Memoirs v. Massachusetts, 383 U.S. 413. MR.
JUSTICE BLACK would also grant certiorari and reverse the judgment.
No. 1165. Fishel Rudawski et al., petitioners, v. Florida. Motion
of Thomas H. Wakefield as Guardian ad litem for unknown heirs of
Jacob Tim, Deceased, to be named as a party respondent granted.
Petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida
denied.
1 He was also convicted for mailing nonobscene circulars advertising these records for
sale. If the records are not obscene, the convictions on these advertising counts obviously
cannot stand. Five additional counts involve the label of a third record, pasted on the
outside of its mailing wrapper. This record was not even alleged to be obscene.

"2. Whether a criminal defendant's constitutional right to due proc-

where the conviction of petitioner Gilbert was based substantially
upon the out-of-court declaration of his co-defendant King which
recited Gilbert's participation in robbery, kidnapping and murder and
King's in court confession which the California Court has ruled as a
matter of state law was impelled by the wrongful admission of King's
hearsay statements?
"3. Whether a criminal defendant's constitutional protection against
unreasonable search and seizure was violated where a conviction was
had upon a capital offense and sentence of death was rendered upon
eyewitness identification that was based, in whole or in part, upon a
viewing by such witnesses of four photographs that were seized by the
F.B.I. from petitioner's locked private apartment without either an
arrest or search warrant at a time when an arrest had not been made
and could not be made, all contrary to the fair administration of
criminal justice and due process provisions of the United States Con-
stitution?
"4. Whether a criminal defendant's constitutional right to counsel
was violated where he was convicted of a capital offense and sentenced
to death upon eyewitness testimony that was based, in whole or in
- seiz
part, upon a viewing by such witnesses of unlawfully sized photo-
graphs prior to their attendance at a police line-up where petitioner
was compelled to appear, without notice, and his attorney was not
given opportunity to be present, all contrary to the fair administration
of criminal justice and due process provisions of the United States
Constitution?
"5. Whether a criminal defendant's constitutional right to the assist-
ance of counsel was violated where following his arrest by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation he demanded the protections afforded by

MONDAY, JUNE 13, 1966
509
presence of counsel and, that same evening, an F.B.I. agent took hand-
writing exemplars from him that were subsequently used against him
at trial of a capital offense, all contrary to the fair administration of
criminal justice and due process provisions of the United States
Constitution?"

New Jersey. On writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of New

opinion and judgment of this Court. He adheres, however, to the views
stated in his separate opinion in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. —

cur in the opinion and judgment of this Court. They continue to
believe, however, for the reasons stated in the dissenting opinions of

promulgated in those cases are both unjustified and unwise. Mr.
Justice Black, with whom Mr. Justice Douglas joins, dissents from
the Court's holding that the petitioners here are not entitled to the
full protections of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments as this Court has
construed them in Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, and Miranda v.
Arizona, 384 U.S. -, for substantially the same reasons stated in their
dissenting opinion in Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S. 618, at 640.

MONDAY, JUNE 20, 1966
522
cuss in their further briefs and oral arguments, in addition to the other
issues, the following questions:
(1) Is the truthful presentation of a newsworthy item ever action-
able under the New York statute as construed or on its face? If so,
does appellant have standing to challenge that aspect of the statute?
(2) Should the per curiam opinion of the New York Court of
Appeals be read as adopting the following portion of the concurring
opinion in the Appellate Division?
"However, if it can be clearly demonstrated that the newsworthy
item is presented, not for the purpose of disseminating news, but
rather for the sole purpose of increasing circulation, then the rationale
for exemption from section 51 no longer exists and the exemption
should not apply. In such circumstances the privilege to use one's
name should not be granted even though a true account of the event
be given let alone when the account is sensationalized and
fictionalized."
(3) Does the concept of “fictionalization," as used in the charge,
the intermediate appellate decisions in this case, and in other New
York cases, require intentional fabrication, or reckless disregard of the
truth or falsity of statements of fact, as a condition of liability?
Would either negligent or non-negligent misstatements suffice? With
respect to these issues, how should the instructions to the jury be
construed?
(4) What are the First Amendment ramifications of the respective
answers to the above questions?
No. 991. Peter Wylan, appellant, v. California. The appellee is
requested to file within thirty days a response to the petition for a
rehearing.

for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and petition for writ of cer-

1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 presented by the petition which read as follows:
"1. Whether petitioner's Fourteenth Amendment rights were vio-
lated by a conviction and sentence to death obtained on the basis of
a confession made under inherently coercive circumstances within the
doctrine of Fikes v. Alabama, 352 U.S. 191.
"2. Whether petitioner's Fourteenth Amendment rights were vio-
lated by the failure of the Georgia courts to afford a fair and reliable
procedure for determining the voluntariness of his alleged coerced
confession in disregard of the principle of Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S.
368.
"3. Whether petitioner's Fourteenth Amendment right to counsel
as declared in Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, was violated by the
use of his confession obtained during police interrogation in the ab-
sence of counsel, or whether petitioner's right to counsel was effectively
waived.
"4. Is a conviction constitutional where:
"(a) local practice pursuant to state statute requires racially segre-
gated tax books and county jurors are selected from such books;
"(b) the number of Negroes chosen is only 5% of the jurors but they
comprise about 20% of the taxpayers; and
"(c) a Negro criminal defendant's offer to prove a practice of
arbitrary and systematic Negro inclusion or exclusion based on jury
lists of the prior ten years is disallowed?
"5. Where a Negro defendant sentenced to death in Georgia for the
rape of a white woman offers to prove that nineteen times as many
Negroes as whites have been executed for rape in Georgia in an effort
to show that racial discrimination violating the equal protection clause

MONDAY, JUNE 20, 1966

of the Fourteenth Amendment produced such a result, may this offer
of proof be disallowed?"

No. 274. Beaufort Concrete Company, petitioner, v. Atlantic States
Construction Company. Petition for writ of certiorari to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied. Dissenting
opinion by Mr. Justice Black:
I would grant certiorari in this case. This is another in a growing
number of cases in which the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure have
been used to prevent the fair and just determination of a lawsuit on
the merits. See, e.g., Ford v. Helmandollar, 348 F. 2d 780, cert. de-
nied, 383 U.S. 928, BLACK, J., dissenting; Riess v. Murchison, cert.
denied, 383 U.S. 946, BLACK, J., dissenting; Link v. Wabash R. Co.,
370 U.S. 626, Black, J., joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, dissenting. In
this case I think the summary judgment entered against petitioner
by the District Court and affirmed by the Court of Appeals should be
reversed and the case remanded to the District Court so that peti-
tioner can have his day in court. The facts in summary are these. Pe-
titioner supplied respondent with concrete to build some docks and
warehouses near Savannah, Georgia. When respondent did not pay
for all the concrete supplied, petitioner brought this suit to recover the
balance, about $90,000. Respondent moved for summary judgment
supporting its motion with several affidavits stating that a large por-
tion of petitioner's concrete was defective. On the day set for hear-
ing petitioner filed three affidavits with the court which asserted that
the concrete furnished was not defective and that if it was it became
so because respondent's agents had ordered it to be watered down.
The District Court, however, refused to consider petitioner's affidavits
on the ground that they had not been served "prior to the day of hear-
ing" as provided by Rule 56 (c) of the Federal Rules, and on the basis
of the pleadings and respondent's affidavits alone, the court entered
summary judgment for respondent. The Court of Appeals affirmed
stating that under the Federal Rules the trial court had broad discre-
tionary power either to accept or reject petitioner's untimely affidavits
but that the court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting the affidavits.
The Court of Appeals went on to state that "Without the excluded affi-
davits, little is left to the plaintiff's case-nothing in fact, but the bare
allegation in the complaint that [plaintiff] furnished adequate con-
crete for which it was not fully paid." Thus for the delay of a few
hours less than one day-in serving affidavits on respondent's coun-
sel, petitioner was deprived of all opportunity to have the court con-
sider its affidavit evidence, which if true, would have entitled it to
collect the $90,000 balance for the concrete supplied.
I find it entirely at odds with a fair system of trying lawsuits to
throw out a litigant's case because his lawyer for negligence or some
other reason fails by less than 24 hours to satisfy one of many pro-
cedural time limits. From the beginning to the end of a lawsuit a

MONDAY, JUNE 20, 1966
529
lawyer must meet a host of time limits for filing papers. Surely a
judge should not have discretion to enter final judgment at will every
time a slight lapse occurs which may delay for half a day or so the
service of one of a multitude of papers that must be served during the
trial and appeal of a lawsuit.
The summary judgment entered below indicates, in my opinion, a
failure to appreciate that "The basic purpose of the Federal Rules is
to administer justice through fair trials, not through summary dis-
missals as necessary as they may be on occasion." Surowizt v. Hilton
Hotels Corp., 383 U.S. 363, 373. If the Federal Rules, as the Court of
Appeals holds, repose in the district courts discretion to deprive parties
of a full trial on their claims in circumstances like these, then it in-
dicates to me that these rules exalt strict obedience to formality and
"paper work" high above the fair and just trial of lawsuits. Never-
theless, the Federal Rules have been administered this way time and
again. As I pointed out in my dissent to the new Federal Rules
recently adopted:
Cases coming before the federal courts over the years now
filling nearly 40 volumes of Federal Rules Decisions show an
accumulation of grievances by lawyers and litigants about the way
many trial judges exercise their almost unlimited discretionary
powers to use pretrial procedures to dismiss cases without trials.
In fact, many of these cases indicate a belief among many judges
and legal commentators that the cause of justice is best served in
the long run not by trials on the merits but by summary dis-
missals based on out of court affidavits, pretrial depositions, and
other pretrial techniques. ·U.S.
-
"The filing of court papers on time is, of course, important in our
court system. But lawsuits are not conducted to reward the litigant
whose lawyer is most diligent or to punish the litigant whose lawyer
is careless. Procedural paper requirements should never stand as a
series of dangerous hazards to the achievement of justice through a
fair trial on the merits."
