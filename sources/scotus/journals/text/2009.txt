                       Order in Pending Case
   No. 09A648. Dennis Hollingsworth, et al., Applicants v. Kristin M.
Perry, et al. Upon consideration of the application for stay presented
to Justice Kennedy and by him referred to the Court, it is ordered that
the order of the United States District Court for the Northern District
of California, case No. 3:09–cv-02292, permitting real-time streaming
is stayed except as it permits streaming to other rooms within the
conﬁnes of the courthouse in which the trial is to be held. Any addi­
tional order permitting broadcast of the proceedings is also stayed
pending further order of this Court. To permit further consideration
in this Court, this order will remain in effect until Wednesday, January
13, 2010, at 4 p.m. eastern time. Dissent by Justice Breyer. I agree with
the Court that further consideration is warranted, and I am pleased
that the stay is time limited. However, I would undertake that consid­
eration without a temporary stay in place. This stay prohibits the
transmission of proceedings to other federal courthouses. In my view,
the Court’s standard for granting a stay is not met. See Conkright v.
Frommert, 556 U. S. –––, ––– (2009) (slip op., at 1–2) (Ginsburg, J., in
chambers). In particular, the papers ﬁled, in my view, do not show a
likelihood of “irreparable harm.” With respect, I dissent.

Statement Concerning the Supreme Court’s Front Entrance

   Memorandum of Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Ginsburg
joins.

  I write with regret to note the closing of the Court’s front entrance.
The Supreme Court building is currently undergoing extensive con­
struction, and the Court has decided that, after this construction is
completed, visitors to the Court—including the parties whose cases we
decide, the attorneys who argue those cases, and the members of the
public who come to listen and to observe their government in action—
will have to enter through a side door. While I recognize the reasons
for this change, on balance I do not believe they justify it. I think the
change is unfortunate, and I write in the hope that the public will one
day in the future be able to enter the Court’s Great Hall after passing
under the famous words “Equal Justice Under Law.”
  Cass Gilbert faced a difﬁcult problem when he was commissioned to
design the Court’s present home. The Court was to be built on a
small, irregularly-shaped plot of land adjacent to both the Capitol and
the Library of Congress, two powerful and prominent architectural
competitors. How was Gilbert to create a distinctive, yet ﬁtting, home
for the Court in these circumstances?
  Gilbert’s solution was to design an entrance that, in the words of
architect and lawyer Paul Byard, “emphasiz[ed] the processional prog­
ress toward justice reenacted daily in [the Court’s] premises.” Start­
ing at the Court’s western plaza, Gilbert’s plan leads visitors along
a carefully choreographed, climbing path that ultimately ends at the
courtroom itself. The Court’s forty-four marble steps, the James
Earle Fraser sculptures Contemplation of Justice and Authority of
Law, the Western portico with its eight pairs of columns standing high
above the removed wings of the building, the Great Hall—each of these
elements does its part to encourage contemplation of the Court’s cen­
tral purpose, the administration of justice to all who seek it.
  But the signiﬁcance of the Court’s front entrance extends beyond its
design and function. Writers and artists regularly use the steps to
represent the ideal that anyone in this country may obtain meaningful
justice through application to this Court. And the steps appear in
countless photographs commemorating famous arguments or other mo­
ments of historical importance. In short, time has proven the success
of Gilbert’s vision: To many members of the public, this Court’s main
entrance and front steps are not only a means to, but also a metaphor
for, access to the Court itself.

  This is why, even though visitors will remain able to leave via the
front entrance, I ﬁnd dispiriting the Court’s decision to refuse to permit
the public to enter. I certainly recognize the concerns identiﬁed in the
two security studies that led to this recent decision (which reafﬁrmed a
decision made several years ago). But potential security threats will
exist regardless of which entrance we use. And, in making this deci­
sion, it is important not to undervalue the symbolic and historic impor­
tance of allowing visitors to enter the Court after walking up Gilbert’s
famed front steps.
  To my knowledge, and I have spoken to numerous jurists and archi­
tects worldwide, no other Supreme Court in the world—including
those, such as Israel’s, that face security concerns equal to or greater
than ours—has closed its main entrance to the public. And the main
entrances to numerous other prominent public buildings in America
remain open. I thus remain hopeful that, sometime in the future, tech­
nological advances, a Congressional appropriation, or the dissipation of
the current security risks will enable us to restore the Supreme Court’s
main entrance as a symbol of digniﬁed openness and meaningful access
to equal justice under law.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

   Present: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Stevens, Justice Scalia, Jus­
tice Kennedy, Justice Thomas, Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, Justice
Alito, and Justice Sotomayor.
   The Chief Justice said:
   “It is my very sad duty to announce that Martin David Ginsburg,
husband of our colleague, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, died yesterday,
June 27, 2010, at home in Washington, D. C.
   “Martin Ginsburg was born in Brooklyn, New York on June 10, 1932.
He earned an A.B. from Cornell University in 1953 and a J.D. magna
cum laude from Harvard Law School in 1958.
   “Martin Ginsburg and Ruth Bader Ginsburg met at Cornell on a
blind date in 1951 and were married on June 23, 1954 at his parents’
home on Long Island.
   “Martin Ginsburg served in the United States Army from 1954 until
1956 and was stationed at Fort Sill, Oklahoma where he taught in the
artillery school. He had a distinguished career in the law, ﬁrst in pri­
vate practice, and later as a renowned law professor known not only
for his academic contributions, but also his sharp wit and engaging
charm. He began his career as a tax professor at New York University
Law School and continued at Columbia Law School. When Ruth Bader
Ginsburg was appointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit in 1980, Martin Ginsburg joined the faculty
of the Georgetown University Law Center. He was a visiting professor
at Stanford Law School, Harvard Law School, University of Chicago
Law School, and New York University Law School. He served on many
advisory boards and deservedly won numerous academic accolades and
awards. He was a member of the Bar of this Court. He was also a
gourmet cook.
   “Martin Ginsburg was as loving as he was gifted. He was a devoted
husband, father, and grandfather, and he was a dear friend to everyone
here at the Court. As a mark of our sorrow and affection for Martin,
Justice Ginsburg, and their family, the journal of the court will note
that the adjournment of this Court today is in honor of Professor Mar­
tin David Ginsburg.”
  The Chief Justice said:
  “We have issued orders today, they have been duly entered and certi­
ﬁed, and ﬁled with the Clerk.”

ment is afﬁrmed under 28 U. S. C. § 2109, which provides that under
these circumstances “the court shall enter its order afﬁrming the judg­

of this Court. Opinion by The Chief Justice. Dissenting opinion by an­
nounced by Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Gins­

   The Chief Justice said:
   “Before we rise for the summer, I would like to take the opportunity
to note that our Reporter of Decisions, Frank D. Wagner, has an­
nounced his retirement, effective September 30th of this year. Few
outside this Court are aware of the Reporter’s important role. He is
responsible for the preparation of the decisions of this Court for publi­
cation in the ofﬁcial United States Reports. Among many other things,
the Reporter is responsible for preparing the syllabus and resolving
issues of formatting style, punctuation, spelling, and citation form.
Mr. Wagner has served as reporter for more than 23 years. He has
overseen the publication of 82 volumes of the Supreme Court Reports,
more than any previous reporter, going back 220 years. Mr. Wagner,
we thank you for your service, which you have performed with exem­
plary diligence and skill.”
   “And now I must regrettably note for the record that this is the last
session at which our friend and colleague, Justice John Paul Stevens,
will be on the Bench with us. Justice Stevens has served on this court
with great distinction since December 1975. We wish him the best in
his well-deserved retirement. On this occasion, we have sent Justice
Stevens a letter that I will now read.
   “Dear John, the Supreme Court convened for the ﬁrst time in 1790.
You have served on its bench for nearly one-sixth of its existence. For
the past thirty-four years, this Court has drawn strength from your
presence. Whether in majority, separate concurrence, or dissent, you
have brought rigor and integrity to the resolution of the most difﬁcult
issues. Through it all, you have alloyed genuine collegiality with inde­
pendent judgment. Your decision to retire saddens each of us in distinct
ways. We will miss your wisdom, your perceptive insights and vast life
experience, your unaffected decency and resolute commitment to jus­
tice. But we also know that your presence will endure through your
contributions to the Court’s work. You have enriched us through your
inspiring example of public service. The bonds of friendship that we
have forged extend beyond our common endeavor. We wish you and
Maryan great happiness in the years ahead. Affectionately, and the

Justice Souter. Justice Stevens, we will allow you time for rebuttal.”
   Justice Stevens said:
   “Well Chief, I have addressed a response that’s addressed ‘Dear Col­
leagues’, and it occurred to me sitting here that if I had written this
letter when I joined the Court, it would have been addressed ‘Dear
Brethren’ but ‘Dear Colleagues’ suits today’s composition of the Court.
Collegiality and independence characterize our common endeavor.
I thank you for your kind words, far more importantly, Maryan and I
thank each of you and each of your spouses, present and departed, for
your warm and enduring friendship. It has been an honor and a privi­
lege to share custodial responsibility for a great institution with the
eight of you, and with ten of your predecessors. I have enjoyed working
with each of you and with every member of the Supreme Court work­
force that has always taken such excellent care of the Justices. If I
have overstayed my welcome, it is because this is such a unique and
wonderful job. I wish you all the best. Most sincerely.”
   The Chief Justice said”
   “I am authorized to announce that the Court has acted on all cases
submitted for decision this Term. Disposition of items scheduled for
conference today will be reﬂected on the order list that will be released
at 10:00 o’clock tomorrow morning. The Court will be in recess from
today until the ﬁrst Monday in October 2010, at which time the October
2009 Term of the Court will be adjourned and the October 2010 Term
of the Court will begin as provided by law.
   “My colleagues and I thank the members of the Court staff for their
outstanding work and dedication to their important duties. The impor­
tant work done by the members of the Court staff contributes signiﬁ­
cantly to the accomplishment of the Court’s mission.
   “We also thank the members of the Court’s Bar for their profession­
alism and cooperation.”
