The Chief Justice said:
"The Court is in special session this afternoon to receive the resolu-
tions of the Bar of the Supreme Court in tribute to our former colleague
and friend, the late Justice Stewart.
The Solicitor General is recognized at this time for the purpose of
presenting those resolutions which were adopted by the Bar. Mr. Solici-
tor General."
Mr. Solicitor General Fried addressed the Court as follows:
"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
· The members of the Bar of the Court met this day and and have
adopted resolutions in honor of Justice Stewart. And I would ask leave
of the Court to present those resolutions at this time.

RESOLUTIONS
161
We have convened today in this Temple of Justice where the late As-
sociate Justice Potter Stewart served with the highest distinction to
give formal expression to the esteem and affection in which we held this
able and devoted lawyer and jurist.
He was born January 23, 1915 in Jackson, Michigan, the birthplace,
also, of the political party with which he was affiliated before he began
his judicial career; but he grew up in Ohio, the family home, where the
Stewarts had for many years contributed signally to the development
and governance of the Buckeye State. He was the son of Harriet Pot-
ter Stewart and James Garfield Stewart, a fabled orator who included
among his achievements service for several terms as mayor of Cincin-
nati and later as Justice of the Supreme Court of Ohio. Potter Stewart
attended Cincinnati's University School, Hotchkiss School, and Yale
College, where he graduated cum laude, was elected to Phi Beta
Kappa, and served as Chairman of the Yale Daily News. After a year
at Cambridge on a Henry fellowship, he entered the Yale Law School.
He received his J. D. degree from Yale in 1941 after a brilliant aca-
demic career that included an editorship of the Yale Law Journal.
These were the days when the validity of much of the New Deal Legis-
lation was challenged in the Court and Yale Law School was in the van
of the legal realism movement. Professor Jerold Israel, who served as
one of his law clerks, has speculated that these debates may have had a
significant impact upon the development of Justice Stewart's legal
philosophy.'
His initial employment with a Wall Street law firm was interrupted
in its first year when our nation entered World War II. He served
more than three years on active duty in the United States Naval Re-
serves as a deck officer on oil tankers in what he called the "dungaree
navy." He concluded his naval service with three battle stars, and
after a brief period with the Wall Street firm, returned to Cincinnati to
join a leading firm in the general practice of law.
He and Mary Ann Bertles had married on April 24, 1943, and they
both settled down to the challenging and rewarding life of a promising
young lawyer in the Queen City. His ability was recognized in his serv-
ice in many charitable and civic community organizations, and he was
elected in 1950 to the Cincinnati City Council. He was reelected in
1952, and was serving as vice-mayor when President Dwight D. Eisen-
'Israel, Justice Potter Stewart, in IV The Justices of the Supreme Court
(L. Friedman and F. Israel, eds, 1969).

hower appointed him, although only thirty-nine years of age, to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit on June 1, 1954.
This appointment afforded the young judge an excellent opportunity to
acquire a wide range of judicial experience.
As Justice Stewart was to observe later, "The Sixth Federal Judicial
Circuit is a cross section of the nation. Extending from the tip of Michi-
gan's upper peninsula to the Mississippi border, it spans the heartland
of our country. So it is that the United States Court of Appeals for the
Sixth Circuit is not a regional court but in every sense a national one.
Its workload reflects the pluralism and diversity of our national life. To
it for decision came admiralty cases from the Great Lakes, moonshine
cases from Appalachia, labor cases from Cleveland, patent cases from
Detroit, tax cases from Memphis-criminal cases and civil cases of
every conceivable kind from almost everywhere within the Circuit's
broad borders." 2
In his four years as the junior judge of the Sixth Circuit Court of
Appeals, Justice Stewart quickly earned the reputation of a careful,
learned, and industrious judge. When Justice Harold Burton, a fellow
Ohioan announced his retirement in the fall of 1958, it surprised no one
that President Eisenhower turned to the talented and energetic young
Cincinnati judge from the Sixth Circuit.
Professor Israel has written, “. . . on October 7, 1958, [when] Presi-
dent Eisenhower formally announced the appointment, [t]he selection
of Stewart was highly praised by the bar, although there was some
southern opposition to the appointment of a 'northern integrationist'.
(One of Stewart's few major constitutional decisions on the Court of Ap-
peals had been a school segregation case in which the court ordered al-
most immediate integration, Clemons v. Board of Education of
Hillsboro, 228 F. 2d 853 [6th Cir. 1956].) Only forty-three at the time
of his appointment, Stewart became the second youngest Supreme
Court Justice since the pre-civil war period." 3
Many observers of and commentators on the business of the Court
frequently try to identify an ideological division between the justices
and attempt to explain the decisions of the Court as reflecting the
philosophical predispositions of their authors. When Stewart took his
seat, the Court was popularly viewed as evenly divided between an ac-
tivist or liberal group of four Justices and a passivist or conservative

group of an equal number. Stewart was asked by a journalist how he
classified himself. His response came as no surprise to those who knew
him, "I like to be thought of as a lawyer.
Dean Terrance Sandalow, Justice Stewart's first law clerk on the
Court, has written, "Justice Stewart never confused cases with causes
or ideology. The responsibility of the judge, in his view, is to decide the
former, not to promote the latter." 4
Professor Laurence H. Tribe, another Stewart law clerk, also recog-
nized this approach of the Justice to the decisional process, "He was
less interested in pursuing a unified philosophical vision than in deter-
mining what the law, as he understood it, required in the case at hand.
And his most consistent philosophy was his skepticism about the vir-
tues of apparently consistent philosophies. Never an ideologue, Justice
Stewart found himself at the Court's 'center' not out of political predi-
lection, but because his habit of mind was to start from a position of
equipoise, and from there to assess the competing arguments of the
parties before him. What the particular parties in a case had to say
mattered greatly to this Justice; he saw the Court's business as that of
deciding cases, not of arbitrating causes. Thus he was ever the careful
student of the briefs and, during oral argument, one of the most active
Justices which is to say, from the perspective of one who has argued
before him, one of the most relentless and demanding." 5
-
His personal relationships with his judicial brethren and with the
lawyers who came before the Court was one of unfailing courtesy and
consideration, and he always manifested the greatest respect for the
traditions of the legal profession and the Court. Once, an over zealous
lawyer during a question period at a Sixth Circuit Conference asked
Justice Stewart about an opinion of "Wiley Rutledge." Justice Stewart
looked at the lawyer quizzically and inquired, "Were you personally
acquainted with Mr. Justice Rutledge?
"
But Justice Stewart was not without passion. Manifest injustices
could evoke from him the scathing denunciation of an Old Testament
prophet. Shortly before he retired, with hands almost trembling as he
suppressed his outrage, he read from the bench a dissenting opinion in
which he refused to accord absolute judicial immunity to a state judge
who had, ex parte, at the request of the parents of a fifteen year old
girl, authorized her sterilization without her knowledge. "A Judge is

not free like a loose cannon," he said, “to inflict damage whenever he
announces that he is acting in his judicial capacity.
" 6
Although the Court was its professional centerpiece, it was not all of
Justice Stewart's life, and at the end of the term in 1981 he decided to
retire at age 66 to permit him to spend more time with his beloved
Andy, their children and grandchildren.
His retirement plans included making recordings for talking books
for the blind and serving on public and private boards and commissions
where he might share some of the rich experiences and wisdom that he
had acquired in his eventful life. He achieved many of these goals
when, in the fullness of his involvement with life, he left it on December
7, 1985.
He wrote a short concurring opinion in Jacobellis v. Ohio' that was
reconstructed by the press into an epigram that received such currency
that he feared that it might become his epitaph. A rephrasing of that
apothegm would make it read more appropriately, “He may not have
been able to define justice, but he knew it when he dispensed it."
Wherefore, it is accordingly
RESOLVED, that we, the Bar of the Supreme Court of the United
States, express our lasting and great appreciation for the exemplary
service rendered by Potter Stewart during his long public career, as
Cincinnati councilman, as Judge of the Court of Appeals, and then as a
distinguished Associate Justice of this Court, and later as a retired
Associate Justice; that we record with great affection and esteem for
him, and our admiration for the qualities of wise judgment, of diligent
and perceptive craftsmanship, and of personal generosity and gentle-
manliness which enabled him to be so effective in contributing to the
progress of the law and to the betterment of our Nation; and it is
further
RESOLVED, that the Solicitor General be asked to present these
Resolutions to the Court and that the Attorney General be asked to
move that they be inscribed upon the Court's permanent record.

The Chief Justice said:
“Thank you, Mr. Solicitor General. The Court now recognizes the
Attorney General of the United States."
Mr. Attorney General Meese addressed the Court as follows:
“Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
As you have heard from the Solicitor General, the Bar of this Court
met today to honor the memory of Potter Stewart, Associate Justice of
the Supreme Court from 1958 to 1981. It is my privilege on behalf of
the Supreme Court Bar to present a few remarks about this distin-
guished jurist and to offer a motion before the Court.
Justice Stewart was only 43 years old when President Eisenhower
appointed him to this Court. But while he came to the Court relatively
young in age, Potter Stewart brought with him a highly developed
sense of our system of governance and a finely tuned appreciation for
the purposes and vision of the written Constitution that structures that
system. As part of that appreciation, he had a particularly keen under-
standing of the role of a judge in our constitutional republic.
Justice Stewart began learning about our constitutional system of
governance at an early age. His father was a mayor and, later, a judge
on the Ohio Supreme Court. Justice Stewart learned about the legal
system from his father and then followed his father's path in law, gov-
ernment, and the judiciary. He studied jurisprudence at Cambridge
and Yale Universities, practiced law in New York and Cincinnati,
served as a member of the city council and as a vice-mayor of Cincin-
nati, and sat as a federal judge on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.
Thus, by the time he came to this Court, Potter Stewart had the sea-
soning of first-hand experience with almost every aspect of the legal
system and the institutions that function within it.
These experiences profoundly shaped Justice Stewart's view of the
function of this Court in interpreting the Constitution and laws of our
country. Having served in a war, in local elective office, and on the fed-
eral appellate bench, Justice Stewart had a particularly keen under-
standing of the role played by each of the different branches of govern-

166
MONDAY, OCTOBER 20, 1986
ment in our constitutional system. He appreciated, as did the founding
fathers, the importance of a separation of powers, of federalism, and of
an independent judiciary to the preservation of liberty. Justice Stew-
art realized that reposing unchecked authority in any branch of govern-
ment is the antithesis of what our constitutional system is about.
It has been often noted that Justice Stewart avoided unnecessarily
far-reaching pronouncements and paid unusually careful attention to
the facts of the cases before him. At oral argument he always wanted
advocates to be attentive to the facts that produced and shaped a par-
ticular dispute. He repeatedly stressed that the heart of a case could
be found in its facts, and he was not satisfied to proceed on less than a
full understanding of those facts. His opinions typically reflect the
same focus: they carefully document the events that brought a particu-
lar controversy to the Court, examine the various arguments that the
parties could make in advocating a particular result, and then, applying
Occam's razor, answer the question presented—and no more. Justice
Stewart's public performance thus exemplified his conviction that the
Court is on the surest and most proper ground when it acts not as a
philosophical or political body, but rather as a legal, institution.
Whether one agreed or disagreed with his opinions in particular
cases, Justice Stewart's lawyerly approach, good judgment, and ele-
gant prose always brought great credit to this Court. His jurispru-
dence shows a reverence for the basic tenets of our constitutional tradi-
tion-free speech, religious liberty, protection of civil rights, and
reliance on the representative processes of government.
For example, in cases involving speech and religion, Justice Stewart
urged the Court to champion “a society of free choice." [Ginsberg v.
New York, 390 U.S. 629, 648 (1968) (Stewart, J., concurring).] He be-
lieved, as he said, that "those who wrote our First Amendment. . . put
their faith, for better or worse, in the enlightened choice of the people,
free from interference of a policeman's intrusive thumb or a judge's
heavy hand." [Ginzburg v. United States, 383 U.S. 463, 498 (1966)
(Stewart, J., dissenting).] Thus, he wrote for the Court in Edwards v.
South Carolina that a State could not "make criminal the peaceful ex-
pression of unpopular views," [Edwards v. South Carolina, 372 U.S.
229, 237 (1963),] and he dissented when the Court allowed a State, in
his view, to force an individual “to choose between his religious faith
and his economic survival." [Braunfeld v. Brown, 366 U.S. 599, 616
(1961) Stewart, J., dissenting).] To Justice Stewart, the First Amend-
ment was the "foundation" on which our constitutional system is built.
[See Bates v. Little Rock, 361 U.S. 516, 522–523 (1960).]

Justice Stewart understood that our Constitution guarantees more
than just orderly processes. He deeply believed, for example, that the
Constitution without exception-guarantees equal treatment for peo-
ple of all races. He wrote that the Constitution does not allow "the
criminality of an act [to] depend upon the race of the actor,"
[McLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U.S. 184, 198 (1964) (Stewart, J., concur-
ring); see also Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 13 (1967),] and he dis-
sented in a case involving a race-conscious program sponsored by the
Federal Government, stating that the "equal protection standard of the
Constitution had one clear and central meaning-it absolutely prohibits
invidious discrimination by government." [See Fullilove v. Klutznick,
448 U.S. 448, 523 (1980).] Justice Stewart believed that our Constitu-
tion has promised equal opportunity to all, and all institutions of gov-
ernment are duty bound to enforce that promise.
Justice Stewart also believed that the Constitution preserved various
powers for the states. For example, though he agreed that the Eighth
Amendment's prohibition against capital punishment was substantial,
he believed that the states were entitled to enact death penalty statutes
with appropriate safeguards. [See Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153
(1976).] Similarly, though he believed Congress had substantial power
to regulate interstate commerce, he believed strongly that the regula-
tion of "wholly local activities" was reserved to the states. [Perez v.
United States, 402 U.S. 146, 157 (1971) (dissenting opinion).]
Justice Stewart viewed as a pervasive theme of our Constitution a
deep faith that each individual in our society is capable of intelligent
choice. This conviction in the ability of individuals rationally to choose
underlay his pronouncement for the Court that the Sixth and Four-
teenth Amendments give a criminal defendant the right "to proceed
without counsel when he voluntarily and intelligently elects to do so."
[Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 807 (1975) (emphasis in original).]
It similarly underlay his positions, albeit in dissent, that public school
students should be allowed to engage in voluntary non-denominational
prayer, [see Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, 444-445 (1962) (Stewart, J.,
dissenting)]; and that criminal suspects should be allowed to respond to
questions without first being warned of their privilege against self-in-
crimination and of the consequences of foregoing it, [see Miranda v.
Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 504-545 (1966) (dissenting opinion); see also
Orozco v. Texas, 394 U.S. 324, 331 (1969) (Stewart, J., dissenting).]
Concomitantly, Justice Stewart appreciated that “the essence of judi-
cial duty [required him] to subordinate [his] own personal views ***,”
[Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 530–531 (1965) (Stewart, J.,

168
MONDAY, OCTOBER 20, 1986
dissenting),] and that the Court should not normally substitute its judg-
ment for that of elected legislative bodies. Thus, in an equal protection
opinion, he forcefully articulated for the Court the proposition that "the
intractable economic, social, and even philosophical problems presented
by public welfare assistance programs are not the business of this
Court," [Dandridge v. Williams, 397 U.S. 471, 487 (1970),] and he
found especially troubling cases which called upon the Court to address
claims not expressly governed by the text or the history of the Con-
stitution itself. [See Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. at 530–531.]
However, in cases where the Constitutional text and history is clear,
Justice Stewart was properly forceful and vigilant in safeguarding fun-
damental civil rights. [As evidenced by his opinion for the Court in Al-
lied Structural Steel Co. v. Spannaus, 438 U.S. 234 (1978).]
In remembering Justice Stewart's work and career, we should also
remember his unusual personal qualities of character, integrity, and
intelligence. Justice Stewart had a quick wit that cut through cant or
hypocrisy and he learned early on not to take himself too seriously.
While a student at Hotchkiss he was elected class wit with 43 votes.
The next closest wit got only 4. I personally learned of Potter Stew-
art's sense of humor and good fellowship when the two of us joined Wil-
liam Buckley and Walter Cronkite in a humorous skit on the stage of
the Bohemian Grove.
"
Those of us who had the privilege to know him will always remember
Justice Stewart's love for politics, the Cincinnati Reds, and most of all
his family. For Justice Stewart was a husband, father, and grandfather
who savored his private life as much as his public service. Many public
men and women often find it difficult in the midst of attention and hon-
ors to keep their eye on what T. S. Eliot called “the permanent things."
Justice Stewart knew his priorities. He always put his family first.
Mr. Chief Justice, in the name of the lawyers of this nation and, in
particular, of the Bar of this Court, I respectfully request that the reso-
lutions presented in honor and celebration of the memory of the late
Justice Potter Stewart be accepted by you, and that they, together
with the chronicle of these proceedings, be ordered kept for all time in
the records of this Court."
The Chief Justice said:
"Mr. Attorney General and Mr. Solicitor General, the Court thanks
you on behalf of the Bar for your presentations today in memory of our
late colleague and friend, Justice Stewart.
$

We ask that you convey to Chairman McCree and the members of the
Committee on Resolutions our profound appreciation for these very ap-
propriate resolutions. Your motion that these resolutions be made a
part of the permanent record of the Court is hereby granted.
Potter Stewart was many things besides a judge.
He was an avid fan of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team. Those of us
who served with him at the time can still remember his intense interest
in that great seven-game world series of 1975 between the Cincinnati
Reds and the Boston Red Sox, and his delight with the Reds' triumph in
four games over the New York Yankees in the World Series of 1976.
He was a fisherman. In fact, he was one of the very few fishermen I
have ever known who didn't like to get up early in the morning.
He was a patriot, not in the sense often attributed to Stephen Deca-
tur-"my country, right or wrong,"-but in the sense that many of his
contemporaries were, contemporaries who had served creditably and
honorably in the Armed Forces in the second World War and who still
many years later got goose bumps when they saw the flag passing by on
a ceremonial occasion.
He was also something of a mentor to me, although he may not have
realized it. He was not the sort of a fellow to ostentatiously take a
neophyte under his wing, and show him how the land lay. But a num-
ber of his very preceptive observations made to me-and doubtless
made to others who had joined the Court after he had-gave me a feel
for the way the institution worked.
I remember his telling me that he felt he would never know more
about a case than when he left the bench after hearing the case orally
argued. Over a period of time I tested out this bit of wisdom which he
had imparted, and came to agree with him completely.
Justices of this Court rightly prize their complete independence, not
only from authority in the other branches of government, but from
their colleagues; no member of this Court is bound to surrender his
opinion on a particular matter even though eight colleagues totally dis-
agree with him. Potter Stewart cherished this independence in the
same way that all of us do, but he was also constantly mindful that even
on an Article III court such as ours, a judge is a member of an organiza-
tion. The organization has no claim on the judgment of a Justice, but it
does have a claim of a smaller order-that the judge manage his own
work in such a way as to assist his eight colleagues in getting their work
done. Potter Stewart managed as well as any colleague I have known
to balance the demands of the collegiate institution against the need for

170
MONDAY, OCTOBER 20, 1986
full development and exposition of ones own opinions in cases before the
Court.
He was a superb craftsman of the written opinion. His opinions were
short, lucid, and to the point. His father, James Garfield Stewart, had
been active in elective politics in the state of Ohio, and was in fact serv-
ing on the Supreme Court of Ohio when Potter Stewart was appointed
to this Court. Potter retained a lively spectator's interest in electoral
politics for all of his life, but like all good judges he refrained from
mixing partisan politics with judging. When his opinions had finished
dealing with the legal questions involved, they ended; he was content to
be a judge, and did not aspire to be a robed statesman. His discussion
of cases at the conferences of the Court followed the same model: lucid,
analytical, and to the point.
During the time he served with Chief Justice Burger, Potter Stewart
was on occasion referred to as one of the "swing" votes on the Court,
which is an appellation apparently reserved for those who are some-
where in the middle of the ideological spectrum of the Court as consti-
tuted at a particular time. If this classification be thought to suggest
that he had no established constitutional hierarchy of his own, it could
not be more mistaken. During his period of service with Chief Justice
Warren, he was often in dissent in some of the Warren Court's deci-
sions about the constitutional rights of criminal defendants. During his
service with Chief Justice Burger, he was more often with the majority
in cases such as this. But it was not he who altered his views; it was the
cases coming before the Court and the personnae of the Court which
had changed.
Many of the questions which perplexed the Court during the twenty-
three years during which he served have not been finally resolved, nor
will they be resolved in our time. They embody the issues on which
judges of different philosophies can and do often disagree; the judicial
quest is not to finally put at rest the claims of government against the
claims of the individual, the need for order against the desire for lib-
erty; that is too much to ask of any judges who are, after all, human.
The quest is rather to draw the boundaries in each succeeding case,
knowing that our efforts are apt to be as transient as those of our
predecessors, and very likely those of our successors.
But in this often baffling endeavor, those of us who knew Potter
Stewart, and particularly those of us who served with him on this
Court, know how fortunate it was that during these twenty-three years
there sat upon this bench a judge of keen and penetrating intellect and
unwavering devotion, not simply to the exposition of his own ideas, but

to the work of the Court as a court. He devoted a large part of his life
to that endeavor, and this Court, the Bar, and his country are the
better for his efforts."

The Chief Justice said:
"Before the Court hears arguments today, I have a few announce-
ments to make.
I am authorized to announce that Mr. Henry C. Lind, who has served
as the official Reporter of Decisions of the Court since February, 1979,
is retiring effective January 31, 1987.
The Reporter of Decisions is responsible for the publication in the
official United States Reports of all of the Court's orders and opinions,
as well as the separate opinions of the Justices. During his tenure, Mr.

MONDAY, JANUARY 12, 1987
347
Lind has been instrumental in assisting in the changeover from the hot
lead system of printing the Reports to our modern computer system.
The Reporter's tasks also include the editing of opinions in the sense of
attempting to establish consistency as to such matters as the forms of
citations, preferred spelling of words, punctuation, and grammar—not
an enviable task when dealing with nine separate chambers. Mr. Lind
has performed his duties with great success-he has even been able to
secure approval from the majority of the Court to spell the word “mari-
juana” with a “j” rather than an "h". The Court wishes to pay tribute to
him and to wish him well for the years ahead.
1
Mr. Frank D. Wagner has been appointed by the Court' to succeed
Mr. Lind as the 15th Reporter of Decisions, pursuant to Title 28 of the
United States Code, Section 673.
I am also authorized to announce the retirement of James S. Zagami,
Captain of the Supreme Court Police Force, effective January 13, 1987.
Captain Zagami has served with the Supreme Court Police Force for
over thirty years and the Court wishes him much happiness in the years
ahead.
I have appointed Mr. Noel J. Augustyn as my Administrative Assist-
ant pursuant to Title 28 of the United States Code, Section 677, effec-
tive January 5, 1987.”

RECESS ORDER
The Court will take a recess from today until the first Monday in Oc-
tober, 1987, at which time the October 1986 Term will adjourn.
The Chief Justice said:
"Before we turn to the final announcement on today's calendar, we
wish to take note with great regret the retirement of Justice Lewis F.
Powell as a member of the Court. In due course, all eight of his col-
leagues will express in the form of a traditional letter their feelings for
him as a friend and as a judge, and this letter and his response to it will
then be made part of the Journal of the Court's proceedings.
Justice Powell came to the Court after an illustrious career of private
practice and public service bespeaking the best traditions of the legal
profession. He has now capped that career with fifteen years of able
and devoted service as a Justice of this Court. We shall miss his wise
counsel in our deliberations, but we look forward to being the continu-
ing beneficiaries of his friendship."
ORDER
