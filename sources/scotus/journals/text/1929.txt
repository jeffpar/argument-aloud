On writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of the District of
Columbia. Decree affirmed with costs. Opinion by Mr. Justice
Brandeis.
The Chief Justice announced the following orders of the Court:
No. 578, of October term, 1928. The Macallen Company, appel-
lant, v. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The motions pre-
sented on behalf of the American Bankers Association and on behalf
of the Massachusetts National Bank Association for leave to file
briefs, as amici curiae, in support of the petition for a rehearing in
this cause, are granted.
The Court has considered these two briefs, and also the four
briefs heretofore permitted to be filed by the States of California,
Washington, Oregon, and New York, as friends of the Court. After
consideration of these briefs, and of the petition for a rehearing of
this cause filed by the State of Massachusetts, such petition for a
rehearing is denied.
No., original. Ex parte: In the matter of Federal Radio Com-
mission, petitioner, the motion of petitioner for leave to file a peti-
tion for a writ of mandamus and/or prohibition is set down for
hearing with case No. 122. The petition for a writ of certiorari in
the related action-No. 122 on the appellate docket-is granted.
The parties are directed to file briefs on the question of what the
power of this Court is in respect to the issue of a writ of mandamus.
or a writ of prohibition in this case.
No., original. Ex parte: In the matter of Northern Pacific Rail-
way Company et al., petitioners. The motion for leave to file a peti-
tion for a writ of mandamus, and the motion for leave to amend and
supplement such petition, are granted.
A rule is directed to issue against the respondents, returnable on the
first motion day following a period of 30 days from this date, direct-
ing them to show cause why a writ of mandamus should not issue in
this cause.
No. 18, original. The State of New Jersey, complainant, v. The
City of New York. The motion for the appointment of a special
master is granted; and the Honorable Edward K. Campbell is ap-
pointed special master in this cause, with power to summons wit-
nesses, issue subpoenas, and to take such testimony as may be intro-
duced and such as he may desire to call. The master is directed to
make findings of fact and conclusions of law, and to submit the same
to this Court with all convenient speed, together with his recom-
mendations for a decree. The findings, conclusions, and recommenda-

MONDAY, OCTOBER 14, 1929
39
tions of the master shall be subject to consideration, revision, or
approval by the Court.
No. 9. Hugh W. Grant, Receiver, etc., petitioner, v. A. B. Leach
& Company, Inc. Motion of Hugh W. Grant, Trustee in Bank-
ruptcy, for leave to intervene as a party petitioner is denied.
No. 4, original. The State of Nevada, complainant, v. Crown
Willamette Paper Company. It is ordered that this cause be con-
tinued to the next term, pursuant to the stipulation filed by the par-
ties herein.
No. 360. Behn, Meyer & Company, Ltd., petitioner, v. Howard
Sutherland, as Alien Property Custodian et al. Causes Nos. 360 and
371 are before the Court on petitions for writs of certiorari. The
cases are nominally separate actions by the same corporation against
the Custodian and the Treasurer. The Court is informed, however,
that the real controversy is between rival sets of claimants, each pur-
porting to be entitled to recover the same funds from the Custodian
in the name of the same corporation; and that the Custodian now
occupies the position of a mere stakeholder.
For this reason the motion by respondent in No. 371 for leave
to file a brief opposing the granting of a writ of certiorari in No.
360 is granted.
No. 190. Jennie V. David, petitioner, v. Thomas D. Hubbard, as
Trustee in Bankruptcy of William L. David, Bankrupt; and
No. 191. William L. David, petitioner, v. Thomas D. Hubbard, as
Trustee in Bankruptcy of William L. David, Bankrupt. On peti-
tions for writs of certiorari to the United States Circuit Court of
Appeals for the Third Circuit. Per curiam: The motions for leave to
proceed further herein in forma pauperis are denied. The Court
has examined the unprinted records submitted in support of the peti-
tions for certiorari and finds that the attacks upon the action of the
court below are without any substantial merit. For this reason
the petitions for writs of ceriorari are denied, and the clerk is di-
rected to enter the usual order with respect to the payment of costs
already incurred, as provided in the order of October 29, 1926.
No. 269. Robert G. Meadows, petitioner, v. The United States of
America. The motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis is
granted. The clerk is directed to cause the record in this case to
be printed, and to cause the cost thereof and the clerk's costs al-
ready incurred and such as may hereafter properly be incurred to
be paid as provided in the order of October 29, 1926.
No. 388. Anthony Brown, Eddie Stokes, Walter E. Burke, et al.,
petitioners, v. State of California. On petition for writ of certiorari
to the Supreme Court of the State of California. Per curiam:
The Court is of opinion that the arguments of petitioners upon

MONDAY, OCTOBER 14, 1929
40
the action of the State court in allowing a juror to sit and in denying
a writ of error coram nobis are frivolous. For this reason, the mo-
tion for leave to proceed further herein in forma pauperis, and the
petition for a writ of certiorari, are severally denied.
The clerk is directed to enter the usual order for the payment
of costs already incurred, as provided in the order of October 29,
1926.
No. 87. The Baltimore & Ohio Southwestern Railroad Company,
petitioner, v. Lula Carroll, Administratrix, etc. The petition for
a writ of certiorari herein to the Supreme Court of the State
of Indiana is granted with the limitation, however, that coun-
sel shall confine themselves, in the briefs and in oral argument, to the
question whether this suit is barred by the statute of limitations.
No. 123. Royal Insurance Company, Ltd., et al., petitioners, v.
United States Shipping Board Merchant Fleet Corporation. The
petition for a writ of certiorari herein to the United States Circuit
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is granted. The question
arising in this case is related to the questions presented in three other
cases now before the Court on writs of certiorari, and for that reason
this case is advanced and set down to be heard with the related
causes. The Court desires that the four related cases shall be heard
in the following order: First, Nos. 32 and 5, to be heard together as
one case when No. 32 is reached in the regular call of the docket;
second, No. 123, to be argued separately immediately after the argu-
ment of Nos. 32 and 5; third No. 56, to be heard separately after
the conclusion of the argument in No. 123.

No. 60. The Railroad Commission of the State of California and

McReynolds. Dissenting opinion by Mr. Justice Brandeis, in which
Mr. Justice Holmes concurs. Dissenting opinion by Mr. Justice
Stone.
No. 21, original. Ex parte: In the matter of the Northern Pacific
Railway Company et al., petitioners. Mr. Chief Justice Taft an-
nounced the ruling of the Court. Per curiam: This is a petition
for a writ of mandamus. A rule to show cause was issued and a
return has now been made to the rule. From the petition and the
return the facts are shown to be as follows: The Northern Pacific
Railway Co. and three others brought a suit in the District Court
for the District of Montana against the Board of Railroad Commis-
sioners of that State and others to prevent the enforcement of a rate
order made by the board, the objection urged against the order being
that it was in conflict with the commerce clause of the Constitution
of the United States and with certain provisions of the commerce
laws of Congress. The plaintiffs applied for a temporary restrain-
ing order and for an interlocutory injunction. District Judge Pray
granted a temporary restraining order which was to continue in force
"until the plaintiffs' application for an interlocutory injunction be
heard and determined by three judges as provided by statute."
73606-29-25

MONDAY, DECEMBER 2, 1929
106
Afterwards, but before three judges were assembled to hear the
application for an interlocutory injunction, District Judge Bourquin,
sitting alone, entertained a motion by the defendants to dissolve the
temporary restraining order, and also a motion to dismiss the bill
on the merits. The plaintiffs objected that a single judge was with-
out authority to entertain or act upon either motion, but Judge Bour-
quin overruled the objection, sustained the motion to dismiss, and
entered a final decree of dismissal. Of course, the decree, if valid,
operated not only as a revocation of the temporary restraining order
but also as a denial of the application for an interlocutory injunction.
Manifestly the suit was within the terms and spirit of section
380, title 28, of the United States Code. When Judge Pray granted
a temporary restraining order to be effective until the application
for an interlocutory injunction, it became his duty under that section
immediately to call two other judges, one of whom should be either
a circuit justice or a circuit judge, to assist him in hearing and deter-
mining the application for an interlocutory injunction. Not only
so, but the section as amended by the act of February 13, 1925, c. 29,
43 Stat. 938, extends the requirement respecting the presence of
three judges to the final hearing in such a suit. Under our decisions
construing and applying the section, Judge Bourquin sitting alone
was without jurisdiction to hear either the motion to dissolve the
temporary restraining order or the motion to dismiss the bill on the
merits. In the presence of the application for an interlocutory
injunction—which was at no time withdrawn but constantly pressed-
a single judge, whether Judge Pray or Judge Bourquin, was as
much without authority to dismiss the bill on the merits as he
would be to grant either an interlocutory or a permanent injunction.
Our decisions leave no doubt on these points. Ex parte: Metropoli-
tan Water Company of West Virginia, 220 U. S. 539; Cumberland
Telephone & Telegraph Company v. Louisiana Public Service Com-
mission, 260 U. S. 212, 216-217; Virginian Railway Company v.
United States, 272 U. S. 658, 671-673; Ex parte: Atlantic Coast
Line R. R. Co., 279 U. S. 822.
It follows that the rule against the respondents must be made
absolute, with directions to them to vacate the decree of dismissal
entered by Judge Bourquin and to take immediate steps for assem-
bling a court of three judges to hear and determine the applica-
tion for an interlocutory injunction conformably to section 380.
We assume it will not be necessary to issue a formal writ. Rule
made absolute.

" XLVI
Whenever a custodian, receiver or trustee is a banking institu-

act as depositary for money, said banking institution may, if author-
ized by rule of the local Bankruptcy Court approved by a majority
of the Circuit Judges of the Circuit, keep on deposit with itself

institution under the local laws of the state of its domicile is per-

MONDAY, JANUARY 13, 1930
138
mitted to keep on deposit with itself money collected and received
by it acting as receiver or trustee under the appointment of any
court. Such local rule shall contain such provisions for the super-
vision and control of such deposits as the court may deem adequate,

interest shall be allowed by such banking institution at such rate,
not less than two per centum per annum, as may from time to time

Neither a receiver nor his attorney shall solicit any proof of

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES,
Washington, D. C., February 10, 1930.
DEAR CHIEF JUSTICE: We call you Chief Justice still, for we can
not quickly give up the title by which we have known you for all
these later years and which you have made so dear to us. We can
not let you leave us without trying to tell you how dear you have
made it. You came to us from achievements in other fields, and with
the prestige of the illustrious place that you lately had held, and you
showed in a new form your voluminous capacity for work and for
getting work done, your humor that smoothed the rough places, your
golden heart that has brought you love from every side, and, most
of all, from your brethren whose tasks you have made happy and
light. We grieve at your illness, but your spirit has given life an
impulse that will abide whether you are with us or are away.
Affectionately yours,

UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT,
Washington, D. C., February 12, 1930.
MY DEAR BRETHREN: I can not adequately say how deeply I am
touched by your affectionate letter. I regretted for many reasons
the necessity of tendering my resignation, but none so strong as the
ending of those pleasant associations with each and all of you, which
during the past nine years have been so dear to me. Only the advice
of my doctors and my own conviction that I would be unable to
continue adequately the great work of the court forced me to leave
you. That work, in your hands, will go on as well without me, but
I am grateful, nevertheless, for your words of appreciation.
Sincerely yours,

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES.
Present: Mr. Justice Holmes, Mr. Justice Van Devanter, Mr.
Justice Brandeis, and Mr. Justice Sutherland.
Mr. Justice Holmes said:
"On Saturday, just as we were expecting him at a conference of
the Justices, we were informed that our brother, Mr. Justice Sanford,
had become unconscious pending a slight operation. Five minutes
later we received word that he was dead. Thus suddenly the light
of a faithful worker who was born also to charm went out. After-
wards came the news that the late Chief Justice had found relief
from his hopeless illness in death. Such events must be accepted in
silent awe.
"A committee of the Court, consisting of the Chief Justice, Mr.
Justice McReynolds, Mr. Justice Butler, and Mr. Justice Stone, has
gone to Tennessee for the services over the late Mr. Justice Sanford,
and on Tuesday the whole Court will attend the funeral of Mr. Taft.
"In pursuance of the statute the Court will stand adjourned until
to-morrow, when it will be adjourned again until Wednesday next
at 12 o'clock, when the matters then in order will be taken up."
Adjourned until to-morrow at 12 o'clock.
