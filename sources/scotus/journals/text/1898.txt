Present: The Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Harlan, Mr. Justice Gray,
Mr. Justice Brewer, Mr. Justice Brown, Mr. Justice Shiras, Mr. Justice
White, Mr. Justice Peckham and Mr. Justice McKenna.
The Chief Justice: It is with sincere sorrow that I announce to the
members of the bar the sudden death of Baron Herschell, former Lord
Chancellor of England, information of which has just been received by
the court with deep sensibility.
Lord Herschell had been some months in this country in a public and
international capacity, and but a few days have elapsed since he sat with
us here, a compliment which has been extended only once previously in
the instance of the then Lord Chief Justice of England.
In view of the cordial relations between Lord Herschell and the
members of this court, his great distinction in our common profession
and on the bench, and his unexpected death while absent from home in
the discharge of high public duty, we feel called upon to take notice of
this sad event, and as a mark of respect to his memory the court will
adjourn until to-morrow at the usual hour.
Adjourned until to-morrow at 12 o'clock.

The Chief Justice. It becomes my sad duty to inform the gentlemen
of the bar that Mr. Justice Field on yesterday (Sunday) evening passed
peacefully from this life. He died full of years and of honors, and
attended by all that should accompany old age.
The judicial career of Mr. Justice Field was unexampled in length
and distinction, and he occupied a seat upon this bench for a longer
period than any of its members from the beginning. His labors left no
region of jurisprudence unexplored, and now that he rests from them, his
works will follow him. His retirement when he saw port approaching
was so recent that he hardly seems to have been absent, and his death
comes home to us the more keenly.
As a mark of respect to his memory, the court will adjourn until
to-morrow.
Adjourned until to-morrow at 12 o'clock.
