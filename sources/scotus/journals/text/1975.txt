The Chief Justice said:
"I have a statement to make on behalf of the Court. The announce-
ment of Mr. Justice Douglas' retirement as a member of this Court
was made on Wednesday last week. We on the Court who have been
intimate witnesses to his gallant struggle to recover his health and his
strength hope now that he is free from the incessant burden that his
high sense of duty placed on him, he will be able to direct his great
courage and his infinite willpower to recovering his health.
"Our feelings about him officially as his colleagues, and personally
as his friends, are more fully expressed in a letter signed by all of the
members of the Court and Justice Douglas' reply to that letter. These
letters, I think, will suggest something of the nature of the relation-
ships within the Court in the constant contacts that occur day by day
in an institution in which all of the members must act together and
work together on every matter that comes before the Court."

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES,
Washington, D.C.,
November 14, 1975.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE
DEAR BILL: Only when you made your decision known did we fully
sense what that meant to us and to the Court. For us, as colleagues and
friends, your absence from the Conference table and our deliberations:
will be deeply felt. Whether ultimately we agreed or not, as colleagues
we valued highly your unparalleled knowledge of the multitude of
decisions of the Court covering more than one-third of this century.
It was a unique resource for the Court and one that may never again
be present at our Conference table. We shall always remember your
occasional verbal “footnotes" telling us intimate details as to how some
opinion evolved. As friends we shall miss the daily contacts, which
have varied in length and kind for each of us. Some have long been.
colleagues, some have argued before you, some have come here more
recently, but all of us share great respect and affection for you.
The hope on our part is that, relieved of the burdens of Court work,
your health will improve, and this eases our sense of loss. In the months
since last January we have felt boundless admiration for your courage-
ous fight to recover your strength and your placing duty above con-
cern for your health.
So much has been said and will be said on other occasions about your
remarkable career that no more need be noted now than to recall that
it is far more than a record of longevity, for it spanned a period in
American history comparable to that of the formative period early in
the 19th century when Marshall and then Taney were here.
We shall miss your vast reservoir of firsthand knowledge of the
Court's cases of the past 36 years and, as well, the warm daily contacts
in Conference and on the Bench. It goes without saying that we shall
expect you to share our table as usual, for you remain Senior Justice
Emeritus.
Sincerely,
WARREN E. BURGER.

CHAMBERS OF
JUSTICE WILLIAM O. DOUGLAS
MY DEAR BRETHREN: Your message, written on my retirement from
the Court, filled my heart with overflowing emotion. You were kind.
and generous and made every hour, including the last one on our ardu-
ous journey, happy and relaxed.
I am reminded of many canoe trips I have taken in my lifetime.
Those who start down a water course may be strangers at the begin-
ning but almost invariably are close friends at the end. There were
strong headwinds to overcome and there were rainy as well as sun
drenched days to travel. The portages were long and many and some
were very strenuous. But there were always a pleasant camp in a
stand of white bark birch and water concerts held at night to the
music of the loons; and inevitably there came the last camp fire, the
last breakfast cooked over last night's fire, and the parting was always
sad.
And yet, in fact, there was no parting because each happy memory
of the choice parts of the journey-and of the whole journey-was of
a harmonious united effort filled with fulfilling and beautiful hours
as well as dull and dreary ones. The greatest such journey I've made
has been with you, my Brethren, who were strangers at the start but
warm and fast friends at the end.
The value of our achievements will be for others to appraise. Other
like journeys will be made by those who follow us, and we trust that
they will leave these wilderness water courses as pure and unpolluted
as we left those which we traversed.
Yours faithfully,
WILLIAM O. DOUGLAS.
THE CHIEF JUSTICE AND ASSOCIATE JUSTICES OF THE SUPREME COURT
OF THE UNITED STATES.
The Chief Justice said:
"In accordance with tradition and practice, these letters will be
made part of the permanent records of the Court and will be recorded
in the Court's journal."
Adjourned until Monday, December 1, 1975, at 10 o'clock.

ORDER IN PENDING CASE
No. 75-817. Nebraska Press Association et al., petitioners, v. Hugh
Stuart, Judge, District Court of Lincoln County, Nebraska, et al.
Motion of Nebraska Press Association et al. for leave to treat their
application as a petition for writ of certiorari having been hereto-
fore granted, it is ordered:
1. Petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Nebraska
granted;
2. Motion to expedite denied. Mr. Justice Brennan, Mr. Justice
Stewart, and Mr. Justice Marshall would grant motion.
3. Application for stay denied. Mr. Justice Brennan. Mr. Justice
Stewart, and Mr. Justice Marshall would grant application. Mr.
Justice White would stay judgment of the Nebraska Supreme Court
to the extent that its order forbade the publication of information
disclosed in public at the preliminary hearing in the criminal case
out of which this case arose. In this respect, he is in disagreement
with the Court's actions in this case today. He joins the Court in grant-
ing the petition for writ of certiorari and in ordering plenary con-
sideration of this case, which as he understands it raises issues broader
than the power of the State to enjoin the publication of facts disclosed
at a public hearing in a State court. Being convinced that these ques-
tions should be decided only after adequate briefing and argument
and ample time for mature consideration, he is in agreement that we
should not attempt to hear and decide this case prior to the begin-
ning of the criminal trial in early January.
4. Petitioners Nebraska Press Association et al, are invited to file
an amended petition for certiorari on or before December 30, 1975.
Responses may be made in accord with the Court's Rules.

ORDER IN PENDING CASE
No. A-719. J. J. Enomoto, Director of Corrections, California, et al.,

for a stay of the judgment of the United States District Court for the

ary 14, 1976, as amended by its order of February 9, 1976, is granted

Since I am not persuaded that the applicants have demonstrated a

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Present: Mr. Chief Justice Burger, Mr. Justice Brennan, Mr. Jus-
tice Stewart, Mr. Justice White, Mr. Justice Marshall, Mr. Justice
Blackmun, Mr. Justice Powell, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, and Mr. Jus-
tice Stevens.
The Chief Justice said:
"Today's orders of the Court have been certified by the Chief Jus-
tice, filed with the Clerk, and will not be announced orally."
OPINION PER CURIAM
No. 75-1382. The Omaha National Bank, petitioner, v. Nebraskans
for Independent Banking, Inc., et al. On petition for writ of certio-
rari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.
Petition for writ of certiorari granted, judgment vacated and case
remanded to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration in light of

APPEALS SUMMARY DISPOSITION
No. 73–1915. Lester L. Perkins, appellant, v. Howard Smith et al.
Appeal from the United States District Court for the District of
Maryland. Judgment affirmed. Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice
Marshall would note probable jurisdiction and set case for oral
argument.
No. 74-216. United States Civil Service Commission et al., appel-
lants, v. Jose Antonio Santin Ramos and Jose Joaquin Cabrera
Gomez. Appeal from the United States District Court for the District
of Puerto Rico. Motion of appellees for leave to proceed in forma
pauperis granted. Insofar as the judgment of the United States Dis-
trict Court for the District of Puerto Rico declares 5 C.F.R. § 8338.101
to be invalid, judgment affirmed. Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong, 425
U.S.
(1976). Because the current Appropriation Act's exclu-
sion of payments to aliens for positions within the United States does
not apply to Cuban nationals like the plaintiff-appellee, P. L. 94–91,
89 Stat. 458, the District Court is directed to vacate as moot that part
of its judgment holding § 601 of the Treasury Postal Service and
General Government Appropriation Act of 1973, P. L. 92-351, un-
constitutional.
Insofar as appellants seek to appeal from the District Court's hold-
ing that 7 U.S.C. § 1961 (b) (1) and FHA Instruction 441.2 are un-
constitutional, the appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction. The
210-278-76– -91

crime constitutes a denial of the effective assistance of counsel guar-
anteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution
of the United States, and of the right to a fair hearing as guaranteed
by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, in a case
where the trial judge declines to accept a jury recommendation of a

basis of the pre-sentence report?".

denied.
Mr. Justice Brennan, dissenting:
For the reasons stated in my dissenting opinion in Gregg v. Georgia,
428 U.S.
(1976), the imposition and carrying out
of the death penalty in each of these cases constitutes cruel and un-
usual punishment in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amend-
ments. I would therefore grant certiorari in each of these cases and
vacate the judgment in each case insofar as it leaves undisturbed the
death sentence imposed.
Mr. Justice Marshall, dissenting:
Because I consider the death penalty to be a cruel and unusual pun-
ishment forbidden by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, see
Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S.
(1976) (Marshall, J.,
dissenting) I would grant certiorari in these cases and vacate the
judgments insofar as they leave undisturbed the sentences of death.
No. 74-6168. Clifford Hallman, petitioner, v. Florida;
No. 74-6377. Robert Austin Sullivan, petitioner, v. Florida;

No. 74-6717. Learie Leo Alford, petitioner, v. Florida. Petition
for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida denied.
Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Marshall, dissenting:
Petitioner contends that his right of confrontation, guaranteed by
the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, was violated because the
transcript of the preliminary hearing testimony of a material prose-
cution witness was read at his trial and the prosecution, although it
was aware that the witness would leave Florida prior to the trial,
failed to use available procedures to assure the witness' presence at
trial or to depose the witness before the trial began. See Barber v.
Page, 390 U.S. 719 (1968). On the record in this case, we would grant
certiorari and set the case for oral argument.
In any event, the imposition and carrying out the death penalty in
this case constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the
Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S.
(1976) (Brennan, J., dissenting) ; id., at (Marshall, J.,
dissenting). We would therefore grant certiorari and vacate the judg-
ment in this case insofar as it leaves undisturbed the death sentence
imposed.

tition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for

tion for ceriorari and, as in Colorado Springs Amusements, Ltd. v.
Rizzo, post, at -, remand the case to the Court of Appeals for de-
termination of petitioners' constitutional contentions giving appropri-
ate, but not necessarily conclusive, weight to our summary dispositions.
No. 75-999. Colorado Springs Amusements, Ltd., etc. et al., Peti-

certiorari.
No. 75-6596. Gary Eldon Alvord, petitioner, v. Florida. Petition
for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Florida denied.
Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Marshall, dissenting:
Petitioner contends that he was unconsitutionally convicted because
a statement he made during in-custody interrogation was admitted in
evidence during the prosecution's case-in-chief, despite the absence of
any warning to petitioner that if he could not afford an attorney one
would be appointed to represent him before questioning. See Miranda
v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966). On the record in this case, we would
grant certiorari and set case for oral argument.
In any event, the imposition and carrying out of the death penalty
in this case constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of
the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Gregg v. Georgia, 428
U.S.
(1976) (Brennan, J., dissenting); id., at (Mar-
shall, J., dissenting). We would therefore grant certiorari and vacate
judgment in this case insofar as it leaves undisturbed the death sen-
tence imposed.
