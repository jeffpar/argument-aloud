O'D. Askew, Governor of the State of Florida, et al. The application
for stay presented to Mr. Justice Powell, and by him referred to the
Court, is denied.
The Chief Justice said:
"The Court is in Special Session this afternoon to receive the Resolu-
tions of the Bar of the Supreme Court in tribute to Mr. Justice
Harlan".
Mr. Solicitor General Griswold addressed the Court as follows:
"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
"At a meeting of the Bar held earlier this afternoon resolutions were
adopted in honor and in memory of Mr. Justice John M. Harlan,
which I am instructed to lay before the Court.
"The resolutions unanimously adopted are as follows:
"RESOLUTIONS
"The members of the Bar of the Supreme Court have met to record
our respect and esteem for John Marshall Harlan, Associate Justice
of the Supreme Court of the United States for 16 years from 1955 to
1971. His death on December 29, 1971, following by a few months
his retirement from the Court, has saddened the members of the Ju-
diciary and the Bar and many others, in the United States and else-
where, who recognized and admired his outstanding contributions to
the administration of justice and to the development of the law.
"Justice Harlan was born in Chicago on May 20, 1899. He was
descended from a long line of distinguished forebears, beginning in
the United States with George Harlan, who landed in Delaware in
1687 and later became its Governor. His great-grandfather, James
510-278-72-32

Harlan, was a prominent lawyer in the days of the great Chief Justice
John Marshall and named his son born in 1833 in honor of the Chief
Justice. Forty-four years later, that son, John Marshall Harlan, be-
came a Justice of the Supreme Court, served on the Court for 34 years
and has gone down in history as the 'Great Dissenter' and the only
Justice who dissented in the landmark case of Plessy v. Ferguson.¹
"The first Justice Harlan's son, John Maynard Harlan, who was the
father of our Justice Harlan, was a prominent Chicago lawyer, active
in public and civic affairs and a man of great force and commanding
personality. Those closest to the second Justice Harlan were aware that
his father, as well as his better-known grandfather, was an important
influence on the development of the qualities of mind and character
which made possible his life's achievements.
"After preparatory education in Canada and the United States,
Justice Harlan entered Princeton in 1916. At Princeton, he was Chair-
man of the Daily Princetonian and President of his class for three
years and was recognized by both faculty and fellow students as a
man of marked distinction. In 1920, he was awarded a Rhodes Scholar-
ship and attended Balliol College at Oxford for three years, where
he earned a 'First' in Jurisprudence.² He maintained his contacts
with Oxford and this led to the development of a close relationship
with, and a deep appreciation of, the English Bench and Bar. This
appreciation was reciprocated and is symbolized by his election as an
Honorary Bencher of the Inner Temple.
"In 1923, Justice Harlan began his career in the practice of law by
accepting a position in the New York law firm of Root, Clark, Buckner
and Howland, which was even then a leading firm and which, with
various changes of name, has ever since maintained a position of high
rank among the great law firms of New York. Emory R. Buckner of
that firm was not only a prominent trial lawyer, but was also the
partner most concerned with the management of the office, including
the recruitment of young lawyers. From the very beginning of young
Harlan's association with the firm, Buckner took him under his
wing and over the years had a profound influence on his development
as a trial lawyer.
"In 1925, only two years after young Harlan arrived, Buckner was
appointed United States Attorney for the Southern District of New
York and Harlan was invited to go with him. There, he was entrusted
with increasing responsibilities and was Chief of the Prohibition Sec-
1163 U.S. 537 (1896), which established the "separate but equal" doctrine in
regard to public schools and was not overruled until Brown v. Board of Education
(347 U.S. 483) in 1954.
2 After Justice Harlan returned to the United States, he continued his legal
education by enrolling at and earning a degree from New York Law School.

tion of the office by the time Buckner resigned in 1927 and went back
to private practice, again taking Harlan with him. Four years later,
Harlan became a partner of the firm and remained a partner, with
additional intervals of public service as a Special Prosecutor and in
the Air Force in World War II, until 1954, when President Eisen-
hower appointed him a Judge of the Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit.
"In 1928, Justice Harlan married Ethel Andrews, daughter of a
distinguished Professor of History and sister of John Andrews, a
fellow associate at Root Clark. They had one daughter, Eve, now Mrs.
Frank H. Dillingham, and five grandchildren who brought them much
satisfaction and happiness.
"Justice Harlan's great mentor, Emory Buckner, died in 1941, after
several years of declining health. In 1964, some 23 years after Buck-
ner's death, when Justice Harlan was immersed in his work at the
Supreme Court he participated with others in arranging for the writ-
ing of a biography of Emory Buckner. It is a measure of the debt
which Justice Harlan felt that he owed to Buckner and an apt demon-
stration of the depth and sincerity of his quality of loyalty that he did
this and that he also wrote personally an Introduction to the biography
which is a masterpiece of concise and perceptive expression.³
"In his career as a trial and appellate lawyer in private practice,
Justice Harlan won increasing recognition as a leader of the Bar and,
by 1954, when he became a Judge of the Court of Appeals for the Sec-
ond Circuit, he had attained a position within his profession which
made inevitable the enthusiastic reception accorded to his appointment
by the Bench and Bar. This position had been earned, not only by his
exceptional skill as an advocate, but also by his unremitting drive
for excellence, his penetrating analysis of issues, his clarity and sim-
plicity of expression and his insistence on painstaking attention to
detail.
"Justice Harlan's career in private practice has been admirably
summarized in an article by his former partner, John E. F. Wood,
which appeared in December 1971, in an issue of the Harvard Law
Review dedicated to Justice Harlan on the occasion of his retirement
from the Supreme Court in September of that year. Since Mr. Wood
is himself a leading member of the trial and appellate bar and was
closely associated with Justice Harlan in various litigations over many

issue, the other four being by former Chief Justice Earl Warren, former Chief
Judge J. Edward Lumbard of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit, the present Judge of that Court, Henry J. Friendly, and Charles
Nesson, Professor of Law at Harvard and a former Law Clerk of Justice Harlan.

years, it was deemed appropriate to adopt for these Resolutions the
following from Mr. Wood's article: 5
"
'Throughout his practice, Harlan devoted himself to litigation.
His absorbing interest was in the work of the courts and the func-
tion of lawyers as officers of the court. . . .
66
'His first major civil trial as leading counsel was in the Ella
Wendel case, a complicated and much publicized will contest
which turned on Harlan's painstaking attention to detail and on
his brilliant destruction of false claimants in cross-examination.
In contrast to the drama of Wendel, he later brought his skills to
bear on what some would term drier matters in a complex question
of accounting for revenues among affiliated railroads. He entered
the arena of political rights in attempting to overturn a decision
requiring the New York Board of Higher Education to rescind
their offer of employment to Bertrand Russell as a member of the
faculty of the College of the City of New York.
"'But the cases Harlan argued were as often destined for the law
school casebook as for newspaper headlines. In Randall v. Bailey,
he dealt with questions of state statutory construction having to
do with the determination of surplus for the payment of divi-
dends, and marshalled both legislative history and economic analy-
sis in support of his cause. He examined the contours of federal
judicial power with the perception and sensitivity of the academic
in two celebrated cases on federal procedure, De Beers Con-
solidated Mines, Ltd. v. United States and Cohen v. Beneficial In-
dustrial Loan Corp. His last task before appointment to the
bench-the massive undertaking of both factual and legal analysis
in the famous du Pont-General Motors case-required the con-
centration and dexterity of mind that typified his work as a trial
lawyer.
"One of his great strengths was his mastery of the facts in
every case in which he participated. In the course of his trial prac-
tice Harlan developed an amazing capacity to absorb complicated
sets of facts, to arrange them in proper relationship to each other,
and to state them simply and clearly. This capacity did not flow
from any superficial brilliance or from a gift of clever utterance. It
was accomplished by methodical and painstaking work pursued
with an intensity of concentration that was a marvel to those who
had the privilege of working with him. . . .'
"In addition to his service as an Assistant United States Attorney
under Emory Buckner from 1925 to 1927, Justice Harlan interrupted
his private practice on three occasions for substantial periods of time
5 In quoting from Mr. Wood's article, his footnotes have been omitted.

TUESDAY, OCTOBER 24, 1972
156
to undertake public service. The first such occasion was from 1928 to
1930, when Buckner was appointed by Governor Alfred E. Smith as a
Special Assistant Attorney General to investigate a sewer scandal
in the Borough of Queens and to prosecute Maurice Connolly, the then
Borough President of Queens, for his part in this scandal, and Harlan
was appointed to act as Buckner's principal assistant. This assignment
involved for Harlan the supervision of a staff of five able young
lawyers, all of whom were to achieve prominence in later years, in an
unusually complicated and difficult investigation, analysis and correla-
tion of a multitude of detailed facts, and resulted in the resignation
of Connolly and his conviction and sentence to prison.6
"The next interruption of Justice Harlan's private practice was his
service from 1942 to 1945 as Chief of the Operational Analysis Section
of the United States Eighth Air Force headquartered in England, at
first as a civilian and later as a colonel. Harlan's function was to direct
and coordinate the work of a group of scientists in their important
task of analyzing, and endeavoring to improve, the selection of targets
and methods of operation for the strategic bombing of Germany. The
future Justice gave to the performance of his military duties the same
intense concentration and devotion to duty that had characterized his
earlier work in private practice. One incident in 1943 strikingly illus-
trates his dedication to the best possible performance of the task he had
undertaken. This was his volunteered participation as a waist gunner
in a daylight bombing raid on Gelsenkirchen in order to understand
better the problems faced in such an operation. For his wartime service,
Justice Harlan was awarded the Legion of Merit of the United States
and Croix de Guerre of Belgium and France."
"The final interruption of Justice Harlan's private practice was in
1951 and 1952 when, by appointment of Governor Thomas E. Dewey,
he served as Chief Counsel of the New York State Crime Commission.
This Commission, of which the late Joseph M. Proskauer was Chair-
man, held extensive hearings and rendered reports which led to im-
portant remedial action, including the establishment of a Waterfront
Commission of New York Harbor.
"Justice Harlan had been a Judge of the Circuit Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit for only eight months when he was nominated
by President Eisenhower to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court

Commission of Air Force officers that met in London and Paris with correspond-
ing representatives of the other services and our allies to set up a Joint Control
Council to coordinate plans for the post-hostility occupation of Germany. Justice
Harlan's advice and participation in the drafting of documents made a substan-
tial contribution to this important project.

created by the sudden death of Justice Robert H. Jackson. The nomina-
tion was confirmed on March 16, 1955, and Justice Harlan took his
place on the Court on March 28.
"It is safe to predict that history will accord to Justice Harlan a
prominent place among the greatest Justices of the Court. This pre-
diction is strongly supported by the views which have already been
expressed by a long and growing list of eminent legal scholars who
have studied his Supreme Court opinions and have begun the process
of analyzing and evaluating their impact.8
"During his 16 years on the Supreme Court, Justice Harlan wrote
a total of 613 opinions, more than any other Justice during this
period, of which 168 were opinions for the Court, 149 were concurring
opinions and 296 were dissenting opinions. Many of Justice Harlan's
opinions were written in cases of major importance involving complex,
difficult, and often novel, questions of substantive and procedural law,
requiring extensive study of the applicability and effect of provisions
of the Constitution, of the language of federal and state statutes and
of prior decisions of the Supreme Court and other courts. In these cases,
and also in the less important cases, Justice Harlan's opinions are
noteworthy for the clear presentation of the facts of each case and the
careful formulation of the issues presented. The opinions of Justice
Harlan are admirable examples of the effective execution of the judi-
cial function. They are regarded by the Judiciary and the Bar as
models of legal analysis and craftsmanship, even by those who do not
always agree with the conclusions reached in such opinions.
"The sheer magnitude of the work represented by Justice Harlan's
opinions, including, as they did, so many concurring and dissenting
opinions which inevitably added materially to the time and effort re-
quired, is notable in itself. When it is remembered that during his
later years on the Court he was severely handicapped by his impaired
eyesight, his output of opinions is remarkable and is convincing proof
of his devotion to the Court and his appreciation of its importance to
country.
8
One notable example of such expressions of views is a volume of Selected
Opinions and Papers of Justice John M. Harlan entitled "The Evolution of a
Judicial Philosophy" and edited by David L. Shapiro, Professor of Law at
Harvard Law School and a former Law Clerk of Justice Harlan. This volume,
published in 1969 by the Harvard University Press, and sponsored by the William
Nelson Cromwell Foundation, includes a superb foreword by Professor Paul A.
Freund. Additional examples are the five articles in the special issue of the
Harvard Law Review referred to in footnote 4 above. Further noteworthy ex-
amples are three addresses delivered by Justice Potter Stewart, former Attor-
ney General Herbert Brownell and Professor Paul M. Bator at a memorial
ceremony for Justice Harlan at the Association of the Bar of the City of New
York on April 5, 1972, an article by Nathan Lewin, of the District of Columbia
Bar, in the June 1972 issue of the American Bar Association Journal and an
article by Professor Norman Dorsen of the New York University School of Law,
in 44 N.Y.U. Law Review (1969).

"The task of synthesizing from the many opinions of Justice Harlan
his judicial philosophy and approach and the respects in which his
contributions to the law and the administration of justice have been
distinctive is one which cannot appropriately be undertaken at this
time and on this occasion. There are, however, some ingredients of his
opinions which are so pervasive that some reference to them seems
appropriate.
"One of these ingredients is the emphasis placed by Justice Harlan
on the division of powers and functions between the Federal Govern-
ment and the States. This concern on his part surfaced in many dif-
ferent types of cases, but is aptly demonstrated by his position in the
obscenity cases, such as Roth v. United States, 354 U. S. 476, 496
(1957) and Ginzburg v. United States, 383 U. S. 463, 493 (1966). In
his opinion in the Roth case, where he dissents in that case but concurs
in the result in a companion case decided on the same day, he says:
""The Constitution differentiates between those areas of human
conduct subject to the regulation of the States and those subject
to the powers of the Federal Government. The substantive powers
of the two governments, in many instances, are distinct. And in
every case where we are called upon to balance the interest in free
expression against other interests, it seems to me important that
we should keep in the forefront the question of whether those
other interests are state or federal. Since under our constitutional
scheme the two are not necessarily equivalent, the balancing proc-
ess must needs often produce different results.
"'Not only is the federal interest in protecting the Nation against
pornography attenuated, but the dangers of federal censorship in
this field are far greater than anything the States may do. It has
often been said that one of the great strengths of our federal sys-
tem is that we have, in the forty-eight states, forty-eight experi-
mental social laboratories.' 10 (354 U.S. 503-504, 505.)
"A related component of Justice Harlan's judicical approach is the
emphasis placed by him on the separation of the powers and functions
of the Legislative, Executive and Judicial Branches of the Govern-
ment. This is forcefully brought out by his dissenting opinions in the
⁹ See, for example, dissenting opinions of Justice Harlan in Fay v. Noia, 372
U.S. 391, 448 (1963), and Henry v. Mississippi, 379 U.S. 443, 457 (1965).
10 Justice Harlan's concern for the protection of free speech and related con-
stitutional rights is illustrated, also, by a number of cases where he wrote the
opinion of the Court. Examples of these are NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449
(1958), where the Court reversed an Alabama civil contempt judgment against
the NAACP for its refusal to produce its list of members and agents in the State,
and Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15 (1971), where the Court reversed a California
conviction for wearing, in a corridor of the Los Angeles Courthouse, a jacket
bearing an obscene slogan against the draft.

landmark cases of Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 589 (1964), estab-
lishing the 'one man, one vote' doctrine, and in Avery v. Midland
County, 390 U.S. 474, 486 (1968), extending the doctrine to the
80,000 units of local government within the States. His dissenting
opinion in Reynolds is a major exposition of his various reasons for
finding it necessary to dissent, including his above-mentioned concern
to preserve the federal system, and only a reading of the entire opinion
reveals fully the extent to which his conclusion was based upon his
conviction that the Court's decision went beyond the proper scope of
the judicial powers and functions. However, his reliance on this factor
can be glimpsed from the following excerpts from this opinion:
"In these cases the Court holds that seats in the legislatures of
six States are apportioned in ways that violate the Federal
Constitution. . . . These decisions with Wesberry v. Sanders, 376
U.S. 1, involving congressional districting by the States, and
Gray v. Sanders, 372 U.S. 368, relating to elections for statewide
office, have the effect of placing basic aspects of state po-
litical systems under the pervasive overlordship of the federal
judiciary.
""The Court's elaboration of its new "constitutional" doctrine
indicates how far-and how unwisely-it has strayed from the
appropriate bounds of its authority. The consequences of today's
decision is that in all but the handful of States which may already
satisfy the new requirements the local District Court or, it may
be, the State courts, are given blanket authority and the consti-
tutional duty to supervise apportionment of the State Legisla-
tures. It is difficult to imagine a more intolerable and inappro-
priate interference by the judiciary with the independent legis-
latures of the States. . .
"... As I have said before, .. . I believe that the vitality of
our political system, on which in the last analysis all else depends,
is weakened by reliance on the judiciary for political reform. . . .'
(377 U.S. 589, 615, 624.)
"The dissenting opinion in the Reynolds case also includes a succinct
statement of another well-defined component of Justice Harlan's judi-
cial approach. This is his firmly held belief that it is a mistake to as-
sume that it is within the functions of the Court to provide a remedy
for every persistent major problem of society for which a remedy has
not otherwise been provided. Thus, he says:
"Finally, these decisions give support to a current mistaken
view of the Constitution and the constitutional function of this
Court. This view, in a nutshell, is that every major social ill in
this country can find its cure in some constitutional “principle,"
and that this Court should "take the lead" in promoting reform

TUESDAY, OCTOBER 24, 1972
160
when other branches of government fail to act. The Constitution
is not a panacea for every blot upon the public welfare, nor
should this Court, ordained as a judicial body, be thought of as
a general haven for reform movements. The Constitution is an
instrument of government, fundamental to which is the premise
that in a diffusion of governmental authority lies the greatest
promise that this Nation will realize liberty for all its citizens.
This Court, limited in function in accordance with that premise,
does not serve its high purpose when it exceeds it authority,
even to satisfy justified impatience with the slow workings of
the political process.' (377 U.S. 624–625.)
"This thesis, expresses in various ways, recurs frequently in Justice
Harlan's opinions, and must be counted as one of the significant bases
of his decisions in many cases.11
"Still another pervasive ingredient of Justice Harlan's judicial
approach is the view that, in considering the validity of legislative
enactments or executive action challenged on constitutional grounds,
the asserted infringement of constitutional rights involved in such
enactments or action must be balanced against the legitimate inter-
ests of society which the Legislative or Executive Branch was seek-
ing to protect. Coupled with this concept of balancing of interests
is his further view that determinations by the Legislative or Execu-
tive Branch as to the existence of a social problem requiring remedial
action and as to the appropriateness of the measures adopted, should
be given great weight by the judiciary in determining whether such
measures should be invalidated. An example of a major opinion by
Justice Harlan illustrating his application of these two related prin-
ciples is his dissenting opinion in Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 552
(1961), involving a Connecticut statute making it a crime for any
person, including married couples, to use any contraceptive drug or
device. In this instance, after an extensive analysis and detailed ap-
praisal of the individual rights infringed and of the method adopted
by the State-invoking criminal sanctions-to carry out its purpose
of protecting the morals of the community, he reached the conclu-
sion that the statute should be held invalid. This conclusion was sub-
sequently confirmed by the Court in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S.
479 (1965), involving the same statute, with Justice Harlan concurring
"The importance which Justice Harlan attached to this subject and the
amount of thought which he gave to it are demonstrated by the fact that, in
one of his infrequent public addresses, delivered at the dedication of the Amer-
ican Bar Center in Chicago in August 1963, he devoted substantially his entire
address to a carefully formulated exposition of the bases upon which there had
been supported, and his own reasons for opposing, the notion that "all defici-
encies in our society which have failed of correction by other means should find
a cure in the courts."

TUESDAY, OCTOBER 24, 1972
161
in the result in a separate opinion. In many other cases, the application
of these principles by Justice Harlan was a factor in his reaching
the conclusion that the statute or executive action challenge should
be sustained.12
"In the field of enforcement of laws protecting citizens from crimes,
particularly crimes of violence, where the governmental interest was
unquestioned, Justice Harlan believed strongly that, in balancing such
interest against the asserted constitutional rights of those accused of
such crimes, the decisions of the Supreme Court had in some respects
gone too far in upholding the constitutional challenges to convictions.
This resulted in his dissenting from a number of such decisions. One
of the most notable of such dissents is his opinion in the much-dis-
cussed case of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 504 (1966), where
the Court reversed a conviction because there had been admitted at
the trial a confession obtained while the defendant was in custody
and before he had been warned about his right to remain silent and
his right to a lawyer."
13
"In the Miranda opinion, in addition to expounding his reasons for
believing that the Court's decision did not give adequate 'recognition
to society's interest in suspect questioning as an instrument of law
enforcement,' Justice Harlan expressed the view that the practical
effects of the decision would be disappointing with regard to its in-
fluence on policemen and unfortunate in that the new rules propounded
would handicap massive ongoing efforts to bring about sound re-
forms in criminal law enforcement procedures.
"Notwithstanding his dissenting view in Miranda and related cases
that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination should
not be held to invalidate the confessions involved in such cases, Justice
Harlan wrote or joined in several opinions expanding constitutional
protections accorded to the accused. One of these was his opinion for
the Court in Marchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39 (1968), which
added a new dimension to the protections afforded by the Fifth Amend-
ment. In that case, the federal wagering tax statute, requiring pay-
ment of an annual occupation tax and registration, was held invalid
on the ground that the statute required, on pain of criminal prosecu-
tion, the providing of information which could be used to establish
guilt in a subsequent prosecution. An unusual feature of this decision
12
See, for example, Lathrop v. Donohue, 367 U.S. 820, 848 (1961); Scales v.
United States, 367 U.S. 203 (1961); Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 655
(1969) ; N.Y. Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713, 752 (1971)-Justice Har-
lan's last opinion prior to his retirement from the Court.
13
See, also, Justice Harlan's concurring opinion in Orozco v. Texas, 394 U.S.
324, 327 (1969), in which the Miranda doctrine was applied to questioning of
a suspect immediately after arrest.

TUESDAY, OCTOBER 24, 1972

is that the Court expressly overruled two relatively recent prior
decisions of the Court.
"Whatever may be the ultimate verdict of history as to how Justice
Harlan's judicial philosophy should be appraised, there can be no
doubt that he will always be regarded as a Justice who possessed in
the highest degree the qualities of character and dedication which are
an essential component of a truly great judge. These qualities-his
integrity, his fairness, his candor, his courtesy, his enjoyment of the
spirit of professional comradeship, his gentle humor, his modesty, his
intellectual and physical courage and his devotion to the Court and to
the country have won for him the admiration and affection of his
colleagues on the Court, of the succession of gifted young men who
have served as his Law Clerks and of many other judges and lawyers
who have been in a position to form reliable judgments.
"The members of the Bar of the Supreme Court are most grateful
that they have had the privilege of appearing before and knowing
Justice Harlan and that the Court and the country have had the benefit
of his extraordinarily productive and effective service on the Court. His
death has left us with a deep sense of loss and we extend to his family
our most sincere sympathy in their grief. We and our successors at the
Bar will remember Justice Harlan with reverence and with great
affection, and his noble example of selfless dedication to the law and
to the Court will be a source of inspiration to all of us for many years
to come.
"It is accordingly
66
'Resolved, That we, the Bar of the Supreme Court of the United
States, express our profound sorrow at the death of Associate Justice
John Marshall Harlan and our thankfulness for the great and en-
during contributions made by him to the law, to the Court and to the
Nation; and it is further
"Resolved, That the Attorney General be asked to present these
Resolutions to the Court and to request that they be inscribed upon its
permanent records." 14

""A lawyer's and a judge's judge,' as he has been so aptly described,
Justice Harlan was nominated by President Eisenhower in 1954 to
fill the vacancy created by the death of Justice Robert H. Jackson.
In announcing the appointment, the late President said: 'Judge Har-
lan's qualifications are the highest. Certainly, they were the highest
of any that I could find.'
"And, indeed they were. Born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1899 to a
family whose dedication to public service dates back almost 300 years,
John Marshall Harlan was admitted to the New York Bar in 1925,
after distinguishing himself academically at Princeton University, as
a Rhodes scholar at Oxford University, and at New York Law
School.
"The future Justice's training as a lawyer began under the tutelage
of Emory Buckner, then one of the Nation's ablest and most highly re-
garded trial lawyers. Almost immediately after entering the prac-
tice of law, Justice Harlan accompanied Buckner into public service
when the latter was appointed United States Attorney for the South-
ern District of New York. There the Justice not only assisted Buckner
in the trial of many major prosecutions, but also tried a number of
criminal cases.
"Upon leaving the United States Attorney's Office, Justice Harlan
returned to private practice where he became one of the leading mem-
bers of the New York Bar, specializing in highly complex civil and
criminal litigation which brought him before this Court in the role of
an advocate. He twice interrupted his private practice to enter public
service, once as a Special Assistant to the Attorney General of New
York and later as Chief Counsel to the New York State Crime Com-
mission. During World War II he was decorated by three nations for
his services as head of the Operations Analysis Section of the Eighth
Army.
"Some years ago, writing of his association with his mentor, Emory
Buckner, Justice Harlan said: 'The Cornerstone of . . . [his] liti-
gation method was objective and relentless preparation. [He]
was never content to do the best he could with cases as put to him by
his clients, but insisted upon making his own investigation of every
fact and circumstance before rendering his estimate of the situation.”
"The young apprentice had apparently learned his lesson well.
'Objective and rentless preparation' and 'exhaustive investigation'
of cases not only marked Justice Harlan's career at the Bar;
these traits were also clearly reflected in the objectivity with which
he approached cases, in the probing questions he asked of counsel dur-
ing oral argument, and in the brilliantly analytical and exhaustively
researched opinions he wrote during his tenure on this Court and the
United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
"While his opinions, which were the work product of a judicial
craftsman, won him the admiration of students of the Court, and
while his courtesy, objectivity, and general willingness to listen won

TUESDAY, OCTOBER 24, 1972
165
him the special affection of the Bar of the Court, it was his profound
belief in the American Federal System as a bulwark of freedom, and
his devotion to those basic liberties essential to a free society, so
brilliantly expounded upon in his opinions, which can safely be said to
have won him his place in the history of the Court. Justice Harlan
deeply believed that the diffusion of governmental function between
federal and state authority, and between the coordinate branches of
the federal government, afforded safeguards to our free society of
comparable importance to the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth
Amendment. Apart from its significance as an instrument of freedom,
he viewed the manner in which our political system was structured as
a catalyst, fostering diversity, innovation, and experimentation.
"With this guiding belief and his refusal to accept the view that the
Fourteenth Amendment incorporated the provisions of the Bill of
Rights in their entirety, he frequently dissented from opinions of the
Court which he regarded as unnecessarily imposing on the states
restrictions and procedures which were not essential to a system of
ordered liberty and which stifled diversity and experimentation.
But, while he would not acquiesce in interfering with state actions
which fell short of infringing on fundamental rights, he had no
hesitation in meeting the responsibility of the Court to strike down
any action which endangered those liberties essential to a free society.
"In cases involving free speech and association, the rights which
have been described as 'the matrix, the indispensable condition of
nearly every other form of freedom,' Justice Harlan led the Court in
reminding us that '[t]he constitutional right of free expression is
powerful medicine in a society as diverse and populous as ours.
It is designed and intended to remove governmental restraints
from the arena of public discussion, putting the decision as to what
views shall be voiced largely into the hands of each of us, in the hope
that use of such freedom will ultimately produce a more capable
citizenry and more perfect polity and in the belief that no other
approach would comport with the premise of individual dignity and
choice upon which our political system rests.' (Cohen v. California,
403, U.S. 15, 24.)
"And in another opinion he spoke of the 'constitutionally guaran-
teed "freedom to be intellectually . . . diverse or even contrary," and
the "right to differ as to things that touch the heart of the existing
order." (Street v. New York, 394 U.S. 576, 593, citing Board of Edu-
cation v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 641-642.)
"
"In NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449, 462, he stressed 'the vital
relationship between freedom to associate and privacy in one's associa-
tions,' in an opinion which held that the state could not compel the
disclosure of the membership lists of a group that had demonstrated

TUESDAY, OCTOBER 24, 1972
166
that each time its membership lists were disclosed, its members had
been exposed 'to economic reprisal, loss of employment, threat of
physical coercion, and other manifestations of public hostility.'
In Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497, 522, his dissenting opinion turned
to the essential values reflected by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amend-
ments.
Voting then to strike down Connecticut's ban on the use of contracep-
tive devices, as a majority of the Court later did, he noted that while
the statute was not offensive under the traditional view of these con-
stitutional provisions because it involved not an 'intrusion into the
home so much as on the life which characteristically has its place in
the home,' he nevertheless found the distinction to be insubstantial.
[I]f the physical curtilage of the home is protected, it is surely as a
result of the solicitude to protect the privacy of the life within. Cer-
tainly the safeguarding of the home does not follow merely from
the sancity of property rights. The home draws its pre-eminence at the
seat of family life. And the integrity of that life is . . . funda-
mental (367 U.S. at 551). This concern for the sancity and pri-
vacy of the home marked all of Justice Harlan's opinions in Fourth
Amendment cases, although he often found in delicate to balance
these values with his continuing concern that state criminal proceed-
ings not be unduly shackled.
.
"Time does not permit an exhaustive review of Justice Harlan's
work, which included some 600 opinions. But what emerges even from
a cursory examination is the image of a man of great intellectual and
moral integrity, dedicated to the Constitution and committed to
the role of the Court as the protector of the fundamental liberties
essential to a free people.
"To stop at this point, Mr. Chief Justice, without taking note of
Justice Harlan's character and courage would 'miss the full measure
of the man. None of us will forget his example of courage and forti-
tude as he worked without diminution in quantity or quality despite
the illness which virtually blinded him in the last few years of his
life. And all who knew and worked closely with him will never for-
get his kindness, warmth and concern for others. As his close friend
and colleague, Justice Stewart, has said, 'What truly set him apart
was his character. . . his generous and gallant spirit, his selfless
courage, his freedom from all guile, his total decency . . . He was a
great human being of great worth.'
"May it please this honorable Court:
"In the name of the lawyers of this nation, and particularly the Bar
of this Court, I respectfully request that the Resolution presented to
you in memory of the late Justice John Marshall Harlan be accepted.
by you, and that it, together with the chronicle of these proceedings,
be ordered kept for all time in the records of this Court."
The Chief Justice said:

TUESDAY, OCTOBER 24, 1972
167
"Your motion is granted, Mr. Attorney General, and we thank you
for your statement and tributes of the Supreme Court Bar to our late
Brother, John Marshall Harlan.
"In responding, on behalf of the Court, to the very appropriate
tributes to John Harlan, presented by the Attorney General and the
Solicitor General, I would like to provide a brief glimpse of him as we
saw him within the Court on a day-to-day basis. His great powers as an
advocate and his superb qualities as a judge have been eloquently ex-
pressed and we, his colleagues, not only accept but fully endorse what
has been said.
"No single Memorial ceremony, of course, can ever encompass the
range of qualities and facets of a man of the qualities of John Harlan.
At best we can touch on only a few aspects that stand out most clearly.
The tributes to him in the various Resolutions give a variety of ap-
praisals and they are of special value because they are expressions of
close observers going back over nearly 50 years of his life in the law.
"These Resolutions have noted his quiet, but very important public
service. His public service was episodic in the sense that whenever he
was called he dropped his private concerns and turned all his great
talents to the public task at hand. His performance of duty was un-
spectacular, if that word is used in a careful sense, and I use it to
emphasize that John Harlan always concentrated on the objectives and
never dramatized himself-a trait not always found in great advocates.
His selfless approach that placed public service ahead of private gain
or advantage is shown time and again in his life. His service in World
War II is a good example. At the peak of his career as an advocate
he laid aside all his opportunities and private interests and devoted the
war years to the high level military intelligence work that has been
described in the Resolutions, and which, for all its crucial importance
was necessarily behind the scenes. And he did this at an age well
beyond the realistic demands of civilians for active military service.
"Low key would be one description that we who worked with him
day in and day out would accept even when the task he was perform-
ing was far from low key. This quality was, of course, ideal in a judge
from whom all people expect detachment and objectivity.
"The colleagues of his early years saw one period of his career when
his skills were being formed. Others who knew him at the peak of his
career as an advocate saw the intensity of his concentration on the
detailed facts which he saw as the foundation of all cases, the bed-
rock on which legal principles must rest.

TUESDAY, OCTOBER 24, 1972
168
"John Harlan was essentially a very private person and a man of
the present and the future but occasionally he would turn to remi-
niscences about cases he had tried or which he helped prepare in his
earliest days with Emory Buckner. On the rare occasions he did this,
what emerged was his passion for facts. He pursued the facts of his
cases with the single-minded concentration of a scientist engaged in
research. That same concern for the facts of a case persisted throughout
his judicial work.
"His movements, like his thought processes, were always deliberate
and unhurried. His only haste was that of the efficient human machine
whose orderly habits always brought him to where he was expected
in ample time to be prompt in the most casual way.
"We who were his colleagues will always be able to picture him
sauntering into the Conference Room, one hand fingering the heavy
gold watch chain of his grandfather, the elder Justice Harlan, the
other often holding a cigarette.
"His head and face had a sculptured aspect, the eyes deep set but
very alert even in the years that his sight was failing. Invariably, his
countenance had a quizzical half-smiling look, attentive and receptive
to any comment of a colleague. He carried himself unselfconsciously
with great dignity but it was the simple dignity of a man who had
long since come to terms with life and with himself.
"As an experienced, talented and accomplished advocate he knew
that facts are usually the stuff that makes or breaks a case, and in
Conference or on the Bench he knew the facts of the cases. All of us
can recall his contribution to the Conference process. He never talked
at great length but always to the point. In his quietly resonant voice
that commanded attention he might open his discussion saying,
"I would like to back up and link up some facts that, with all
deference, seem to have been treated more lightly than I would
think they deserve.'
Then he would perform the skilled advocate's task of focusing on the
facts he thought controlling in the case.
"Or he might begin by saying:
"Now that we have the whole case before us it is clear this is
a "pewee" but it is here and we should deal with it.'
For John Harlan the 'pewee' case received the same in-depth concen-
tration as every other case. Having mentioned his deep concern with
the facts of every case, I hasten to say that his legal research was of
the highest order and his long experience and fine scholarship enabled
him to carry an enormous number of the Court's opinions in the fore-
front of his mind.
"In this day of labels for public figures, commentators tended to
label John Harlan, but the only shorthand that for me comes near the

TUESDAY, OCTOBER 24, 1972
169
mark is that he was a practitioner of ‘judicial restraint.' This was
not something that developed when he became a judge on the Second
Circuit or a Justice here. He was by nature a restrained person who
never plunged into unexplored doctrinal thickets without the most.
careful advance patrolling of the area. If he could not reasonably
predict the consequences of a holding, he would likely not join it.
With Justice Holmes, it was his view that if a legal principle or con-
cept had been accepted for generations past, the burden to abandon it
was a heavy one for him.
"One of his most profound convictions that has already been alluded
to was that all good things are not mandated by the Constitution and
all undesirable things are not proscribed. He was willing to let some
problems remain for future generations to solve rather than take great
leaps to seductively appealing results. I am not sure whether he was
acquainted with the writings of Rabbi Louis Finkelstein of the Jewish
Theological Seminary of America, but his philosophy seemed to accept
that great theologian's admonition that we should be content 'to leave
a little to the Lord' and to the future.
"When the suggestion was made to me in 1954 that I accept a judicial
appointment soon expected to develop, I concluded that I would find
out how John Harlan as an active practicing lawyer felt about leav-
ing the practice for the Bench. Our backgrounds had some slight sim-
ilarity. I had practiced privately for 21 years and he for nearly 30
years. I visited him in his chambers at Foley Square in New York and
we talked of practice and of government work and he finally said he
suspected I would go on the Bench. I told him I was not at all sure and
I asked how he liked the life of a Circuit Judge after years of active
practice. He smiled and said essentially this:
"It's not nearly as much fun as law practice but after 20 or
30 years at it I think possibly there is a greater opportunity to
grow on the Bench than in the daily grind of a big firm practice.'
John Harlan exhibited great growth capacity all his life but no one
would deny his growth after he became a judge.
"As the date of this Memorial to John Harlan approached I recalled
the visits to him in his last illness in which he bore his misfortune as
he had always faced every crisis in his life, with fortitude and grace,
without complaint, still receiving a friend as though he had asked him
to his home or his chambers for tea. It was in the fall months that the
severity of his condition became clear. Last week as I took a final look
at my garden beds I reflected on this Memorial and looked back on my
association with him. The fallen leaves reminded me that the end of
summer was upon us but the beds were still brilliant with masses of
scarlet, coral and white petals of the last of the summer flowers. Yet I
knew that the frost would soon be on us and the flowers would be gone,

1

and of course the frost came-indeed it came that very night. But just
as we can carry the memory and the image of past beauty and color,
so do we carry the memory of the beauty of the spirit, the personality,
the integrity and character of a friend. John Harlan left a rich legacy
of this kind for his friends and loved ones.
"His bequest to the Law is recorded so that we can consult him at
will in the volumes of the U.S. Reports. But for the warmth of the
man as a cherished friend we need no research. To turn the mind to
his name brings a flood of images and events of the Conferences, of his
resonant voice and patient searching questions from the Bench, of his
extraordinary capacity to announce the reasoning of a complex case
in simple terms, from memory and without the help of notes or text.
Lawyers will remember his genuine understanding of problems of
the lawyer at the lectern. And we can recall our luncheon table talk
and private discourse in which his warmth and wit and grace came out
uninhibited by the diffidence that strangers saw. These are the riches of
memory each of his former colleagues will carry as long as we have the
power of memory.
"Mr. Attorney General, Mr. Solicitor General, on behalf of the
Court I thank you for your presentations here today in memory of
John Harlan. We ask you to convey to the Chairman and the Commit-
tee on Resolutions our appreciation for their efforts. The Resolutions
will be made part of the permanent records of this Court."

our respect for James Francis Byrnes, Justice of the Supreme Court
of the United States from July 11, 1941 to October 3, 1942. His death

President Nixon: "No man in American history has held so many
positions of responsibility in all branches of our Government with
such distinction."
Senator Mansfield: "I wish to join in the remarks just made . .
at the passing of an old friend, . . . a man of many accomplish-
ments, . . . a man of integrity, patriotism and deep understanding.
Those of us who had the pleasure and the privilege of knowing him
will miss him, and miss him greatly."
Senator Scott: "James F. Byrnes was an American's American.
His distinguished career spanned five decades, it was capped off by
unselfish service to the United Nations and subsequently to his fellow.
men throughout the world. Historians have placed the great accom-
plishments of James F. Byrnes high on their list of those who have
labored to insure a world of peace."
Senator Thurmond: "His service to the Nation and to the State of
South Carolina are hallmarks of great distinction. The scope of his
long public career was broad, and he was recognized around the
World for his achievements."
Senator Hollings: "His was the world of action-the arena of
great events. Presidents, prime ministers, and kings eagerly sought his
advice. But his wisdom was never exclusively reserved for statesmen
and monarchs. It was given as openly and freely to anyone willing to
listen."
Governor West: "The State of South Carolina has lost its most
honored citizen; the Nation has lost a dedicated servant; and the world
has lost a great leader."
General Lucius Clay: "He met with the great and with the humble,
and was at home with both. His warm compassion, his deep and abid-
ing loyalty, and his faith in America and its people were ever inspiring.
There are only a few-a very few-in a world of many people who can
by virtue of both character and achievement be called great. Justice
Byrnes was such a man. But of the few who are recognized as great,
there are an even smaller number who are both great and good. Justice
Byrnes was also a good man."
James F. Byrnes was born in Charleston, South Carolina, May 2,
1879, in a simpler era, when America was about to make its great leap
into modern times. The Nation in which he began his life was pre-
dominantly rural and overwhelmingly isolationist. But the Nation in
which he ultimately rose to leadership was complex, highly indus-
trialized and intimately involved in the affairs of the world. Few men
have lived to witness as much history-as much profound transforma-
tion as did Justice Byrnes.
Those who knew him marveled at the ease with which he moved
through the passing years. There was ever present some tremendous
510-278-72-
-61

297
inner strength which helped him hold fast to his moorings amidst the
changes he encountered. America's greatest men have seemed almost
invariably to possess that quality. Through it all, they have retained
their fundamental faith in their fellow man and their deep belief in the
destiny and goodness of their native land. James F. Byrnes had that
kind of character-that kind of greatness.
Those traits of character were nourished during his early years in
Charleston. Jimmy Byrnes was the son of Irish immigrants. His father
died before he was born. His mother faced the upbringing of two
young children-a girl and a boy-having only about $200. It took
hard work and devotion to see the family through-but these were
abundant assets in the Byrnes household. The young boy soon was
peddling sea food and selling newspapers up and down the streets of
Charleston, while his mother worked long hours as a dressmaker and
took on the additional task of leading a local Catholic choir.
Jimmy attended St. James School, but the family resources allowed
no additional formal education. High school was out of the question. By
age 14, he was working for $2.00 a week as office boy in one of Charles-
ton's leading law firms-Mordecai, Gadsden, Rutledge and Hagood.
It was Benjamin Rutledge of that firm who advised young Byrnes to
seek an education by reading books in the Charleston Library. His fol-
lowing that advice led to his becoming one of the best informed and
educated men of his generation, and his education never ended.
In 1900, when 20, he won a competitive examination for the position
of Court Stenographer for the Second Judicial Circuit at Aiken, South
Carolina, where, in his spare time, he read law under Judge James Al-
drich. From 1903 until 1907 he was editor and publisher of The Aiken
Journal and Review, a weekly newspaper. He was admitted to the
Bar in 1904 and practiced law in Aiken from 1904 to 1908. On May 2,
1906, he married Miss Maude Busch, whom he, as a newcomer to Aiken,
had met in the choir of the Episcopal Church there. In casting about
for an explanation of the subsequent flowering of his remarkable life,
it is easy to see that "Miss Maude" was at the heart of all he was and
did. She was his inspiration-ever his charming, devoted and gracious
helpmate.
Things moved quickly for this young couple. Soon the "public
years" over 50 years of dedicated service to his State and Nation-
would begin. As was stated in the citation when he much later received
the Doctor of Laws degree from Yale University: "He shattered the
tradition that energy ends at the Mason and Dixon Line." In 1908
he was elected Solicitor for the Second Judicial Circuit of South
Carolina. It was rumored that he did not enjoy prosecuting his fellow
man. In any event, he, a Democrat, won a seat in Congress two years
later and served in that office for 14 years. There he enjoyed warm
and constructive associations with the political leaders of that time-

men like Joe Cannon and Champ Clark, Speakers of the House-Presi-
dents Woodrow Wilson, Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge-and
Carter Glass, with whom he worked effectively for the adoption of
the Federal Reserve Act, which is still our central banking law. In
the House he was identified with many important legislative activities
and was soon recognized as a master of the art of persuasion and con-
ciliation. There, as a member of an Appropriations Subcommittee,
he met and became a fast friend of young Franklin D. Roosevelt, then
Assistant Secretary of the Navy.
At the end of seven terms in the House, he came home from Wash-
ington in 1924 determined to seek greater opportunities for public
service offered in the Senate. The race that year marked his only loss.
of an election. Former Governor Cole L. Blease defeated him in a
closely contested second primary.
At the invitation of Sam Nichols, with whom he had served in
Congress, and Cecil Wyche, he moved to Spartanburg and successfully
practiced law there for six years in the firm known as Nichols, Wyche
and Byrnes. In 1930, he returned to politics, defeated Senator Blease,
and thus commenced his service in the Senate on the eve of the first
administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He had supported
Roosevelt for nomination as Vice President in 1920, and he supported
him for President in 1932. President Roosevelt relied upon him to
guide much of the sweeping and complicated New Deal legislation.
It was a tribute to the talent and tact of Senator Byrnes that as a
first term Senator he could play such an important role without
offending the party leaders and committee chairmen. He was easily
reelected to the Senate in 1936.
On visits to Japan in 1935 and to Germany in 1937, Senator Byrnes
had been shocked by the mounting evidences of war preparations he
observed. On his return from Germany he reported to President Roose-
velt his deep concern and his feeling that immediate action was nec-
essary to awaken the Congress and the people to the Nation's impera-
tive need of increased appropriations for national defense. He found
that the President fully shared his concern and welcomed his assist-
ance. But it was a long, hard, up-hill struggle, and both the President
and Senator Byrnes had to be careful not to get too far ahead of pub-
lic opinion and the Congress. Then came Hitler's annexation of Austria
in March 1938 and the Munich agreements in September. Despite the
appeals of the President and Secretary Hull in the spring of 1939 for
modification of the Neutrality Act, Byrnes was unable to obtain ac-
tion by the Congress before adjournment. At the end of August Hitler
invaded Poland.
The President then informed Senator Byrnes that he was calling
a special session of the Congress for September 21 to take action on the
repeal of the Arms Embargo. He asked Mr. Byrnes to come to Wash-

1
MONDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1972
299
ington to discuss the situation with him, particularly the steps he
contemplated taking to obtain bipartisan cooperation, both in the
Executive Branch and in the Congress. Byrnes not only arranged.
to clear the way for the confirmation of the appointments of Henry
Stimson as Secretary of War and Frank Knox as Secretary of the
Navy, but at the President's request took over the management of the
fight for the repeal of the arms embargo in the Senate.
In the summer of 1940 the President requested Mr. Byrnes to rep-
resent him on the Platform Committee at the Democratic National
Convention in Chicago. Byrnes handled the delicate and bitterly con-
tested war clauses with consummate skill, managing to add the sav-
ing words "except in case of attack" to the pledge "not to participate
in foreign wars." In August after the fall of France, Byrnes was able
to attach for General Marshall an amendment to a defense appropri-
ation bill which would permit the promotion of officers of exceptional
ability, like Eisenhower, Patton, Clark and Bradley over others with
higher seniority. He was also able to expedite the passage of the highly
controversial Selective Service Act on the eve of the election.
In January, 1941, the President called on Senator Byrnes to assume
responsibility for piloting the Lend-Lease bill through the Congress.
Byrnes was a member of both the Foreign Relations Committee and
the Appropriations Committee. During the winter and spring Byrnes
gave unstintingly of his time and energy to secure the passage of the
Lend-Lease bill and the initial appropriation of seven billion dollars
to implement its program.
On June 12, 1941, in the afterglow of their cooperation in the pro-
motion of the needed legislation, President Roosevelt named Senator
Byrnes to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. The nomination was
confirmed by his fellow Senators the same day. He took office July 11,
1941, and sat for the first time October 6, 1941. The transition from the
Senate to the quiet chambers of the Court was not altogether easy.
But he attacked the new assignment with that lively curiosity, sensi-
tivity, perceptiveness and practicality which were his trademarks. At
a distance he had been an admirer of Chief Justice Stone. That ad-
miration promptly flowered when they came together in a working
relationship, and it was to the Chief Justice that Byrnes turned most
often for counsel during his first weeks on the Court.
In the short span of a single term of Court, the new Justice's phi-
losophy hardly had time to take shape, and its full profile is not easily
discerned from the 15 opinions he wrote. His brief service on the bench
revealed a dedication to the Constitution as written, a respect for the
place of the judiciary, the Congress and the President, in our form of
Government, and a true appreciation of the powers reserved to the
States.

His initial opinion was in the important case of Edwards v. Cali-
fornia, 314 U.S. 160 (1941), in which the Court unanimously held
that a California statute making it a crime to knowingly bring a non-
resident "indigent person" into that State violated the Constitution
of the United States. Byrnes' majority opinion was that the California
statute was unconstitutional because it erected a barrier to interstate
commerce. Justice Douglas, in a concurring opinion in which Justices
Black and Murphy joined, and Justice Jackson in a separate concur-
ring opinion, were of the view that the invalidation of the California
statute should be based upon the Privileges and Immunities Clause of
the Fourteenth Amendment. The trio of opinions which ultimately
emerged were eyed somewhat quizzically by the majority spokesman,
fresh from long years in the legislative forum in which earthy com-
promises were the law of life.
In his maiden opinion, Justice Byrnes revealed that he was not an
undeviating disciple of Stare Decisis. In 1837 the Supreme Court had
said: "We think it as competent and as necessary for a state to provide
precautionary measures against the moral pestilence of paupers, vaga-
bonds, and possibly convicts, as it is to guard against the physical
pestilence which may arise from infectious articles imported, or from a
ship, the crew of which may be laboring under an infectious disease."
City of New York v. Miln, 11 Pet. 102, at 142–143. Although he quoted
from the Miln language and noted the casual repetition of similar
language by the Court over the years, as recently as 1898, Missouri
K&T Ry. Co. v. Haber, 169 U.S. 613, 629, he observed that times and
attitudes change, and he rejected the notion that one without employ-
ment or funds is a "moral pestilence."
Following Edwards, Justice Byrnes wrote 14 opinions for the Court.
They included three dealing with the priorities enjoyed by federal
claims against insolvent or bankrupt debtors, United States v. Emory,
314 U.S. 423 (1941), United States v. Texas, 314 U.S. 480 (1941), and
United States v. New York, 315 U.S. 510 (1942); two dealing with
insurance for members of the Armed Forces, Halliday v. United States,
315 U.S. 94 (1942), and United States v. Citizens Loan and Trust Com-
pany, 316 U.S. 209 (1942); and one dealing with each of the following
subjects: peonage, Taylor v. Georgia, 315 U.S. 25 (1942); an anti-
racketeering statute, United States v. Local 807, 315 U.S. 521 (1942);
a quantitative restriction on corporate land holding in Puerto Rico,
Puerto Rico v. Rubert Hermanos Company, 315 U.S. 637 (1942); the
Miller Act, United States v. Irwin, 316 U.S. 23 (1942); review of an
order of the National Labor Relations Board, Southern Steamship
Company v. National Labor Relations Board, 316 U.S. 31 (1942);
Indian lands. Sioux Tribe v. United States, 316 U.S. 317 (1942); a
coerced confession, Ward v. Texas, 316 U.S. 547 (1942); an antitrust

MONDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1972
301
consent decree, Chrysler Corporation v. United States, 316 U.S. 556
(1942); and the Fair Labor Standards Act, Walling v. Belo Corp., 316
U.S. 624 (1942).
Of these, Taylor v. Georgia, striking down a Georgia statute bind-
ing a workman to his private employment by the threat of imprison-
ment, and Ward v. Texas, reversing a state court criminal conviction
based upon a confession obtained by coercion, are indicative of Justice
Byrnes' reaction to oppression on economic or racial grounds, although
the result in each case was clearly supported by earlier decisions of the
Court. Local 807 reflects a strong inclination to search for and to honor
Congressional intention. And Southern Steamship Company, which
involved conduct of seamen considered by the Court to be mutinous,
reflects an abhorrence of such conduct so sharp as to require holding
that the Labor Board has abused its discretion in ordering reinstate-
ment of the strikers.
Although he wrote no dissents or concurring opinions, Justice
Byrnes was in the minority in 12 cases, six times in the company of
Justice Black, five in the company of Justice Frankfurter, and one in
the company of neither.
It is not easy to speculate how Justice Byrnes' service as a member
of the Court would have developed had he remained there for many
of the 30 years of life which still lay before him. That was not to be.
Sixty-three days after he took his seat on the Court, Pearl Harbor
brought the minds of all to the task of winning World War II. A
greatly harassed President turned to Justice Byrnes for counsel in the
formulation of military policy and the drafting of needed war legis-
lation. Byrnes put the President at ease by assuring him that if he
thought that in war-time because of his-Byrnes-experience in the
ways of the Congress and of the Government he could be of greater
service elsewhere than on the Court, he hoped the President would
call upon him. Within the week it was arranged that the Attorney
General would confer with Byrnes on all the emergency war legisla-
tion and related executive orders. Early in January 1942, an omnibus
bill known as the Second War Powers Act was submitted to the Con-
gress and passed with record speed. Although the activities of Byrnes
outside the Court became known, no public announcement was made,
as both the President and Byrnes thought for the time being Byrnes
could be more effective working quietly and unobtrusively.
In the summer of 1942 the inflationary situation was becoming
tense. Legislation to establish ceilings on wages and prices was stalled
in the Congress. The President's Council and others had recommended
to the President that he issue an Executive Order establishing an
Office of Economic Stabilization vested with power to control wages
and prices, without awaiting action by the Congress. When consulted,

MONDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1972
302
Byrnes advised strongly against that course on the ground that the
controls were too sweeping and affected too many people to be at-
tempted without Congressional approval. The President made
another appeal to the Congress, and a fireside chat, and the legislation
was approved by the Congress and became effective on October 2,
1942.
The following day Byrnes was summoned to the White House. The
President asked him to take a leave of absence from the Court and
become the Director of Economic Stabilization. The President also
stated that there were other duties beyond those of the Director of
Economic Stabilization that he would wish him to assume. Justice
Byrnes replied that no one could grant a Justice of the Supreme Court
a leave of absence and that the Justice alone was responsible for the
discharge of his duties. He further stated that the regulation of wages
and prices involved so many decisions with political implications that
it would not be proper for him to assume such duties and remain on the
Court. He then inquired about the "other duties." The President
explained that he, himself, would not have time to devote to the
prosecution of the war and the many related diplomatic problems and
have any appreciable time left to supervise domestic affairs. He wanted
Byrnes to relieve him of the problems on the home front and the
jurisdictional disputes which increased with the creation of every new
agency. In these disputes he wanted Byrnes to act as "judge" and
he would let it be known that Byrnes' decision was his decision. For
all practical purposes Byrnes would be Assistant President with
offices in the White House. On October 3, 1942, Justice Byrnes
promptly resigned from the Court and accepted appointment as head
of the Office of Economic Stabilization. His fellow Justices expressed
their deep sense of loss and their awareness that he had been moved by
"a sense of duty to render a needed service of public importance in a
time of great national emergency." He responded that it was indeed
"only a sense of duty [which] impelled me to resign from the Court.”
(317 U.S. VII, VIII).
As Director of Economic Stabilization, Byrnes created no orga-
nization of his own. He had only four or five personal assistants. He
conceived it to be his task to see that the various agencies involved
in the stabilization efforts-OPA, Agriculture, War Labor Board,
RFC, WPB, and the Treasury-cooperated and worked as a team.
He gained the confidence, goodwill and respect of all those who
looked to him for guidance—those representing labor as well as those
representing management, and those representing agriculture as well
as those representing industry. But inflation was already out of hand
and the fight to curb the rise of wages and prices without hampering
production was a tough one. From October 1942 to April 1943 the rise

MONDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1972
303
in the cost of living index was held to 4.3 percent. Byrnes was not
satisfied and prepared a stronger, more effective directive known as
the Hold-the-Line order. At Byrnes' suggestion, the President asked
Judge (later Chief Justice) Fred Vinson to take over as Director of
Economic Stabilization in order that Byrnes could devote his energies
to expediting the mobilization of our resources for the prosecution of
the war. With the aid of Byrnes' Hold-the-Line order which he cou-
rageously administered, Judge Vinson was able to hold the rise in
the cost of living index from April 1943 until his resignation in April
1945 to 3.2 percent.
Byrnes, on May 27, 1943, had become Director of the Office of War
Mobilization under an order of the President which authorized him
to originate policies and lay out programs that would coordinate the
work of all war agencies and departments in any way connected with
the production, procurement, transportation and distribution of civil-
ian and military supplies. It probably constituted a greater delegation
of authority than a President had ever previously made. Byrnes be-
came in a very real sense Assistant President. With few exceptions,
his authority was respected and welcomed. His first act as War
Mobilizer was to call upon all agencies engaged in the war effort to
review and report to him their procurement programs realistically and
objectively. The President sought his counsel on the most delicate
matters affecting his relations with the highest officials in the admin-
istration, and with Congressional leaders, and left the handling of the
troublesome coal and railroad strikes, in large measure, to Byrnes.
In June 1944, the President suggested to Byrnes that he wished him
to become the permanent chairman of the forthcoming Democratic
National Convention in Chicago and a candidate for Vice President.
Byrnes was prepared to proceed as the President wished. But when
some opposition in labor circles was voiced to Byrnes, and it appeared
that he could not have the exclusive support of the President, he with-
drew his candidacy.
After the 1944 election, the President, in January 1945, invited
Byrnes to accompany him to the Yalta Conference where postwar
planning was to be considered. There Byrnes got a first taste of some
of the difficult problems which would confront him later that year as
Secretary of State. When Montgomery crossed the Rhine in March,
1945, everyone knew the end of the War was near. Mr. Byrnes saw
that the great domestic job ahead was reconversion. His had been the
task of mobilization. At his suggestion, Fred Vinson was appointed
his successor. In early April Mr. Byrnes returned to his Spartanburg
home for a well earned rest. That was not to be. President Roosevelt
died April 12.

A few days after President Truman took office, he advised Byrnes
that he wished to appoint him Secretary of State, but it was agreed
that no announcement of the appointment would be made until the
end of the United Nations Conference at San Francisco. In the mean-
time the President appointed him to the Interim Committee he had
created to consider when and how the newly developed Atomic Bomb
should be used. The Committee's recommendation for the use of the
bomb, in the opinion of many at the time, saved hundreds of thousands
of lives that would have been lost in the prolongation of the War.
Mr. Byrnes took the oath of office as Secretary of State on July 3, 1945.
One of his first official acts was to sign the protocol formally attesting
that the Charter of the United Nations had come into being. He called
the day "memorable—for all the peace loving peoples of all nations,”
but cautioned that peace depended on the will of the peoples rather
than on documents.
When Byrnes became Secretary of State, World War II was coming
to a close, but the struggle for peace was beginning. The United States
and the Soviet Union-each after its fashion-had sought to suppress
their differences and to cooperate in winning the war. The war-weary
people throughout the world looked to them to cooperate in restoring
peace. But with the defeat of their common enemies, the suppressed
ideological differences of the two great Super-Powers were beginning
to surface and to give rise to fears that the two great allies in war
would become bitter and distrusting rivals in the making of the peace.
In this distressing situation Byrnes pleaded for patience and firm-
ness on our part in the pursuit of peace-patience in not abandoning
the pursuit and hope of world peace, firmness in resisting demands
which did not advance the cause of peace. While eager to reach agree-
ment where he could find common interest to sustain agreement, he
was particularly firm in avoiding any agreement or understanding
that would delay or hamper the restoration of conditions of peace and
normal life in areas under our control.
Byrnes was a realist. If in negotiation he could not secure all he
wished to secure, he would ask himself whether the cause he pleaded
would fare better with no agreement than with such agreement as he
could obtain. If he concluded that the agreement he could obtain was
better than no agreement, he preferred a half loaf to no loaf. It was
this realism of Secretary Byrnes which made possible the restoration
of conditions of peace in Western Europe and which laid the founda-
tion for the present strength of Western Europe.
It was Secretary Byrnes who arranged the reparations settlement
at Potsdam which confined the Soviet claims for reparations from Ger-
many to reparations from the Soviet zone, apart from only limited
contributions from the Western zones. Byrnes foresaw that without

MONDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1972
305
such a settlement the Russians would take as war booty or reparation
whatever they wanted from the Soviet zone, and then in the absence of
such settlement would make inflated claims against the Western Zones
for additional reparations which would seriously hamper economic
recovery.
At the meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers in Paris on
July 11, 1946, Byrnes was able to resolve an equally, if not more,
significant controversy in a strikingly similar fashion. It had been
agreed in principle at Potsdam that Germany should be treated as an
economic unit and common economic policies should be applied in all
zones. But the Allied Control Council could not agree on how Germany
should be administered as an economic unit. The Soviet Union was
dragging its feet and France also was procrastinating. In the mean-
time, the economic situation was deteriorating. Whereupon, in the
Council of Foreign Ministers, Byrnes formally announced:
"Pending agreement among the four powers to implement
the Potsdam agreement requiring the administration of Germany
as an economic unit, the United States will join with any other oc-
cupying government or governments for the treatment of our re-
spective zones as an economic unit. The continuation of the
present situation will result in inflation and economic paralysis.
It will result in increased costs to the occupying powers and un-
necessary suffering to the German people. The United States
is unwilling to share the responsibility for the continuance of such
conditions."
On September 6, 1946 Secretary Byrnes made his memorable speech
at Stuttgart, formally setting forth the American policy towards
Germany which charted the course that the Western Allies were to
follow in restoring peace, prosperity, security and freedom within the
allied zones.
The British promptly agreed to merge their zone, and the French did
likewise a few months later. The Soviet Union held aloof, but could
no longer hamper the slowly developing economic recovery in the
West. The merger of the western zones, called Trizonia, made pos-
sible in due course the establishment of the democratically responsible
West German Government equipped to play its part in the economic
revival of Western Europe.
To shore up Germany against advancing Communism, Secretary
Byrnes had made it clear at Stuttgart that America favored economic
reconstruction in Germany. He had declared, "The American people
want to return the Government of Germany to the German people. The
American people want to help the German people win their way back
to an honorable place among the free and peace-loving people of the
world." As General Clay said at the funeral of Secretary Byrnes, April

MONDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1972
306
12, 1972, "I think this was his finest hour and the policy which he an-
nounced then is still our basic policy. We had taken a major step to
accepting the leadership of the free world, later to result in the
Marshall Plan, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the es-
tablishment of the German Government." The German people still
gratefully remember Secretary Byrnes' speech at Stuttgart. In 1956,
they held there a Tenth Anniversary Celebration, including a great
ovation to Secretary and Mrs. Byrnes who were in attendance as honor
guests. A Twenty-Fifth Anniversary Celebration was held last year.
Secretary Byrnes, then 91, was unable to attend.
In April-1946, Secretary Byrnes had informed President Truman
that medical tests had revealed he had a heart problem and that the
doctors had advised him to relax. He wished therefore to resign as
soon as he had completed the peace treaties with the satellite enemy
states. He had submitted his resignation effective July 1, 1946, and
agreed with the President he would remain until the treaties were com-
pleted. A subsequent test by a different doctor showed no trace of heart
trouble. But, being in doubt as to which test most truly reflected his
condition, he did not inform the President of the subsequent test, and
did not withdraw his resignation. When he had completed the treaties,
he reminded the President of his resignation and asked to be released.
The President said he had hoped Byrnes had forgotten the resignation.
Byrnes' signing the treaties on January 20, 1947, was his last official act
as Secretary of State.
After his retirement as Secretary of State on January 21, 1947, he
divided his time for the next two years between his home in Spartan-
burg and law practice in the well-known Washington firm of Hogan
and Hartson, which had been founded by his cousin, Frank Hogan.
Soon finding himself relaxed and in good health, the world-renowned
statesman, at the urging of many friends, consented to wind up his
extraordinary political career by serving his beloved South Carolina
as Governor from 1951 to 1955. His term as Governor was one of en-
lightenment and pointed the way for continuing progress in his State.
In his inaugural address he had stated: "It is our duty to provide for
the races substantial equality in school facilities. We should do it be-
cause it is right. For me that is sufficient reason. If any person wants
additional reason, I say it is wise." This set the tone for his adminis-
tration. His recommendations to the 1951 General Assembly resulted
in the enactment of a vast school improvement program designed to
furnish equal facilities for all children.
When he retired from public life, January 19, 1955, at the end of
his four-year term as Governor, it was said that the school facilities
for black children in South Carolina then were superior to those for
white children. Two-thirds of the bond money had been spent to pro-

MONDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1972
307
vide facilities for black children. When the 1954–1955 decisions of the
Court dismantled the dual public school system, South Carolina accom-
plished the transition gracefully and without violence. During his
administration, the State also provided substantial funds for better
college and university education of both races, for the care of the men-
tally ill, and for other needed public improvements.
Mr. Byrnes' own education did not reach high school, but he was a
self-taught scholar. His schooling never ended. In his later life he
liked to say, "I am being educated by degrees." Starting in 1935, he
received honorary doctorate degrees from the following colleges and
universities:
College of Charleston
Presbyterian College of South Carolina
John Marshall College of Jersey City
University of North Carolina
The Citadel
University of South Carolina
Columbia University
Furman University
Wofford College
Washington and Lee University
Yale University
University of Pennsylvania
Having experienced adversity and hardship during his youth, Mr.
Byrnes had compassion for all who were similarly situated. In 1948,
with his competent and devoted secretary, Miss Cassie Connor, as
Trustee, he established the James F. Byrnes Scholarship Foundation,
to provide college educations for boys and girls who had lost their
parents early in life. He funded it principally with the proceeds of
his two books: "Speaking Frankly" (Harper and Brothers, 1947) and
"All In One Lifetime" (Harper and Brothers, 1958), and with his
retirement pay, and the proceeds of the sale of his "Isle of Palms"
home. That private Foundation already has provided college educa-
tions for almost 400 "Byrnes Scholars." Since the deaths of Mr. Byrnes
and Miss Connors, the fund for the Foundation continues to grow and
work under the guidance of executives selected by them including now
two of the former "Scholars." Many of the “Scholars" already have
made good in life and are, in turn, making their financial contribu-
tions to the Foundation. Friends of Governor and Mrs. Byrnes are
contributing, and much of his estate has been added to its usefulness.
Approximately $400,000 already has gone into this magnificent educa-
tional enterprise. Mrs. Byrnes early this year wrote: "The results have
given us much pleasure and pride and, although we have no children
of our own, we now have 380 Scholars who call us Mom and Pop."

In 1943, he was awarded, for his World War II service to our
Country, the Distinguished Service Medal, he being one of only 14
civilians who have ever been awarded that honor.
In 1953, while he was Governor, he was appointed by President
Eisenhower as United States Delegate to the United Nations General
Assembly, where he served with distinction.
In 1941, he was elected Life Trustee of Clemson University, with
which he maintained warm associations until his death. In 1966, he
accepted Clemson's formal request, by unanimous resolution, to place
the vast collection of personal papers, documents, historical memo-
randa, memorabilia and souvenirs of his remarkable life in the James
F. Byrnes Room of its main Library, for permanent preservation. A
competent custodian is on duty there to make these treasures accessible
to researchers, historians and the millions of others who keep him in
revered and grateful memory.
We do
RESOLVE that we, the Bar of the Supreme Court of the United
States, express our profound sorrow at the death of Justice James
Francis Byrnes, and our grateful appreciation for his long life of
public service of the highest order in the Executive, Legislative and
Judicial branches of his State and National Governments, giving his
all to a search for light and truth and justice and the promotion of
love, peace and freedom for all mankind:
IT IS FURTHER RESOLVED
That the Attorney General be asked to present these Resolutions to
the Court and to ask that they be inscribed on its permanent records
and that copies of these Resolutions be forwarded to Mrs. Byrnes in
Columbia, South Carolina.

"Thank you, Mr. Solicitor General. Mr. Attorney General."
Mr. Attorney General Kleindienst addressed the Court as follows:
"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:

MONDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1972
309
"The Bar of this Court met today to honor the memory of James
Francis Byrnes, whose brief tenure as Associate Justice of this Court
was characteristic of a lifetime of exceptional service to his Nation.
A man of action and of experience, James F. Byrnes is among the
very few Americans who have served in all three branches of the
Government at the highest levels and with great distinction. His
accomplishments, especially during the war and early post-war
years, when as 'assistant president' he directed the crucial efforts on
the home front—and as Secretary of State-laid the foundation of our
post-war foreign policy, will surely endure for the life of this Nation.
"It is not difficult to see why James F. Byrnes had so important an
impact on the history of our country, for he combined to a rare degree
the qualities that make for leadership and influence: a good mind, good
judgment, character, and energy. These were, of course, rooted in
his childhood. Raised by a widowed mother in Charleston, South
Carolina, young 'Jimmy' Byrnes learned by example the value of
perserverence and thrift. The necessities of life meant the end of
formal schooling at the age of 14, but not the end of self-education.
His discipline in pursuing a course of reading in the Charleston
library prepared him well for the study of law in Judge Aldrich's
chambers while acting as court stenographer in Aiken.
"It was not long after James Byrnes passed the bar, at the age of
24, that he began his career in public service-first as prosecuting at-
torney, then for 14 years as Congressman and 10 years as Senator.
After one term as Associate Justice of this Court, he served as
Director of Economic Stabilization and later as Director of the Office
of War Mobilization, Secretary of State, and finally Governor of his
beloved State of South Carolina.
"Quite earl in his remarkable career, James Byrnes had begun
to learn, as he later observed, that 'in all relationships in life success
and happiness can be achieved only by a willingness to make con-
cessions.' This lesson served him particularly well in the Congress
where, in his words, 'the art of legislating is the art of intelligent
compromise.' Those who knew him as a legislator recognized him
as a master of this art. But compromise for James Byrnes was never
the surrender of principles; it was rather the temporary retreat from
one desired objective in order to attain another.
"As Congressman and Senator, Justice Byrnes commanded the re-
spect and admiration of his colleagues of both parties. As he later
observed, a legislator can achieve distinction if he possesses unusual
ability or unusual personality. Justice Byrnes had both, and to these
qualities he added, characteristically, unusual diligence and unusual

MONDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1972
310
civility. He never let political differences disrun his personal relations;
and he knew well that today's opponent may be tomorrow's ally.
"Once, after a hard-fought battle over the Administrative Reorga-
nization Act of 1939, in which Senator Byrnes was successful, the
leader of the opposition, Harry Byrd of Virginia, was among the first
to congratulate Byrnes. 'That,' he later remarked of Byrd, is one of
the reasons he is respected and loved.' And so it was with Byrnes
himself.
"Even before he had served in all three branches of the Govern-
ment, James Byrnes had developed a strong sense of the importance of
separation of powers, which he regarded as the principal safeguard
against dictatorship. It was on this ground that he advised against
and resisted President Roosevelt's ill-fated effort to purge the Senate
in the 1938 primaries.
"When in July of 1941 Byrnes was appointed to fill the seat of
retiring Justice James McReynolds, he brought with him his commit-
ment to separation of powers, which, had his tenure been a longer
one, would surely have been reflected in his decisions.
"His fifteen opinions for the Court could not, of course, do more
than suggest the new Justice's developing judicial philosophy. He
could later say, however, that the 'supreme test of judicial states-
manship,' in his view, was 'to preserve the balance between the powers
of the Federal Government and the powers of the State.' He strongly
believed that the role of the court is to interpret the laws and not to
make them, and that it should resolve ambiguities by consulting the
legislative history in an effort to understand the intent of the
legislature.
"His colleagues on the court quickly recognized the new justice's
special abilities and personal qualities. On a draft of one opinion,
a colleague wrote: 'Neat and complete. I verily believe that you say
more by saying less-and what you say is truly good.'
"Like Holmes, Justice Byrnes believed a dissenting opinion should
not be written unless a Justice felt strongly on the subject. He
did not find it necessary to write a dissent during his one term,
although his opinion for the court in Walling v. Belo Corporation,
316 U.S. 624, involving a difficult question under the Fair Labor
Standards Act, was drafted as a dissent and was issued as the majority
opinion only after it persuaded Justice Jackson to change his vote.”
"Later, when the President called upon him in a time of national
emergency, Justice Byrnes saw that he would have to resign. He
has said: 'It was not easy to leave the Court, with its opportunity
for service, its prestige and security-the work I liked and the
Associates for whom I had a genuine affection. 'But in time of war
my duty was plain.' And his responsibilities were awesome.

MONDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1972
311
"As Director of the Office of War Mobilization, Justice Byrnes was
given greater authority than any President had previously delegated,
with full responsibility for all Federal efforts connected with the pro-
duction and distribution of civilian and military supplies. When
Byrnes resigned from that position several years later, President
Roosevelt said he would reappoint him to the Supreme Court when
the next vacancy occurred. Byrnes, the political realist, demurred,
however, saying that his reappointment would lead to false and
damaging speculation that there had been a secret understanding
between them.
"As President Truman's Secretary of State and later as Governor
of South Carolina, James Byrnes completed one of the most diverse
and extraordinary public careers in our country's history. In January
1955 he left the Governor's office and public life with an understand-
able sense of fulfillment. His own words are an especially fitting ex-
pression of that sentiment:
""Within me was the satisfaction that comes from the consciousness
that through the years I had faithfully tried to discharge my duty.
I knew I had made mistakes, because I am human. I knew I had made
political enemies because I had taken positions on controversial issues
and fought to sustain those convictions. But there was compensation in
the knowledge that I had made countless friends whose understand-
ing and sympathy had enriched
my life.
66 6
"As I thought of the past, overriding all thoughts of personal rela-
tions was my realization that this country is truly the land of
opportunity.
"Now as I think of the future, my hope is that my experiences may
encourage others to dedicate their talents and energies to public serv-
ice, for I believe with Tolstoi that "The sole meaning of life is to serve
humanity."
"May it please this Honorable Court: In the name of the lawyers of
this Nation, and particularly of the Bar of this Court, I respectfully
request that the resolution presented to you in memory of the late
Justice James F. Byrnes be accepted by you, and that it, together with
the chronicle of these proceedings, be ordered kept for all time in the
records of this Court."
The Chief Justice said:
"Your motion is granted, Mr. Attorney General, and we thank you
for your statement and tributes of the Supreme Court Bar to our late
Brother, James Francis Byrnes.
"At the time of this Memorial today, only Justice Douglas of the
present Court served on the Court when Justice Byrnes was here, and
Justice Douglas has asked me to express his very deep regret that a

'
MONDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1972
312
commitment made before the date was fixed for this memorial service
prevents his being here today. In visiting with Justice Douglas about
Justice Byrnes, I learned that he and Byrnes had been friends from the
time Justice Douglas first came to Washington as a member of the
Securities and Exchange Commission more than 35 years ago.
"As others have done, Justice Douglas recalled particularly the
warm human qualities that have been spoken of so eloquently in the
Memorial today. He said few men he had known could concentrate on
important governmental problems of the highest order for long hours
and yet, when the work was finished at the end of the day, turn to the
rich pleasures of congenial friends at dinner. He recalled that a
favorite pastime of Justice Byrnes was to participate in singing folk
songs and ballads of the South and of America in his rich tenor voice.
"When Justice Byrnes came to this Court it was after an enormously
active career as a leader in public life, and he found the change to the
isolated life of a Justice of this Court not easy to make. But nothing
in his opinions while he was on the Court would give any indication
of any difficulties in the transition.
"Justice Byrnes had a remarkable capacity to adjust to new respon-
sibilities and new situations. When Taylor v. Georgia was unanimously
decided in 1942, Chief Justice Stone assigned the writing of the
opinion to Justice Byrnes for the very sound reason that an opinion
by a leading figure from the South gave added force to a holding that
the Georgia statute violated Federal prohibitions against peonage.
From yet another point of view, the opinion in that case reflects the
broad national outlook he was prepared to take once he came to
this Court and was free to lay aside sectional or regional interests
and attitudes.
"I had the honor to attend the services for Justice Byrnes in Colum-
bia and heard the eloquent eulogy to him delivered by General Lucius
Clay. When Justice Byrnes was drafted from the Court in 1944 to
become Director of War Mobilization, General Clay was appointed
his Deputy, and later they were intimately associated in Europe follow-
ing our occupation of Germany. General Clay described very graphi-
cally the breadth of vision and the great skill of Justice Byrnes in the
representation of American interests in Europe while he was Secretary
of State. This, of course, was one of the crucial periods in the develop-
ment of American foreign policy, and his handling of these problems
took into account the natural tendency of every country to turn inward
after a war.
"Justice Byrnes, as Secretary of State and as a leading political
figure in the country, was determined that the United States should
not turn its back on the world after the enormous sacrifices that had
brought victory. His remarkable talents as a conciliator and a negotia-

1
MONDAY, DECEMBER 18, 1972
313
tor that had developed through his many years in legislative work
enabled him to deal with some of the most difficult and trying problems
ever to confront an American statesman or diplomat. His exposition
of American policy relating to post-war Europe and the pledge on
behalf of the United States that we would support Western civiliza-
tion and the restoration of Europe stands out as one of the high points
in his remarkable career.
"General Clay, who shared some of the most trying hours in Europe
in the work of Justice Byrnes as Secretary of State, recalls the same
warm human qualities that so many others remember. General Clay
told me that these qualities helped to sustain the Justice while he was
representing the interests of our country in those difficult times.
"In Europe, as in the days when Justice Byrnes sat on this Court, he
would renew and refresh himself, after long hours of negotiation and
intense dealing with the representatives of Russia, by laying work
aside and spending an evening with friends singing the songs that are a
common heritage for all Americans. The historians and biographers
will chronicle the unique career of Justice Byrnes in the highest levels
of all three branches of Government, but his friends will remember him
for his humanity and his love of life and people.
"Mr. Attorney General, Mr. Solicitor General, on behalf of the Court
I thank you for your presentations here today in memory of James
Byrnes. We ask you to convey to the Chairman and the Committee on
Resolutions our appreciation for their efforts. The resolutions will be
made part of the permanent records of this Court."
Adjourned until Monday, January 8, 1973, at 10 o'clock.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Present: Mr. Chief Justice Burger, Mr. Justice Douglas, Mr. Justice
Brennan, Mr. Justice Stewart, Mr. Justice White, Mr. Justice Mar-
shall, Mr. Justice Blackmun, Mr. Justice Powell, and Mr. Justice
Rehnquist.
The Chief Justice said:
"Before proceeding with our regular matters this morning, we will
pause for a moment to take note of an important anniversary of our
Brother, Mr. Justice William O. Douglas. Thirty-four years ago today
he took the oath of office as an Associate Justice of this Court and in
the history of this Court, only Chief Justice Marshall, our late Broth-
er Justice Black and Justice Field served longer. Very soon Justice
Douglas will surpass the record of even those three Justices. In his
long career on this Court he has been a strong, articulate individualist
willing to blaze new trails whether in the majority or in dissent but
also willing to tread ancient paths of the law.
"Several qualities distinguish Justice Douglas from many other
illustrious predecessors on the Court but I will mention only one. He
is possessed of a restless, questing mind and spirit not only in the law
but in relation to the world around him and in the events of his time.
On his vacations he has climbed mountains, visited strange parts of
strange lands and he has written and lectured about them. He has also
written of current developments on the social, economic and political
scene and for all of his life he has been devoted to nature and the out-
door life. He was a student of ecology before the word had currency
1. and in his concern for man's environment he was far ahead of his time.
His service on the Court spans the tenure of five Chief Justices and by
the end of this Term of Court his opinions will appear in 103 volumes
or more than one-fourth of all volumes of reported cases of the Court.
"I know I speak for all Justices and retired Justices on this anni-
versary in extending to you, Bill, our best wishes for continued good
health, long life and much happiness and many more mountains to
climb."
