                          Oral Arguments
   No. 14–8358. Avondale Lockhart, Petitioner v. United States. Ar­
gued by Mr. Edward S. Zas for the petitioner and by Ms. Ann O’Con­
nell for the respondent.
   No. 14–1096. Jorge Luna Torres, Petitioner v. Loretta E. Lynch,
Attorney General. Argued by Mr. Matthew L. Guadagno for the peti­
tioner and by Ms. Elaine J. Goldenberg for the respondent.


  Adjourned until Wednesday, November 4, 2015, at 10 o’clock.


                       Order in Pending Case
   No. 15A473. Ernest Lee Johnson, Applicant v. George A. Lombardi,
et al. The application for stay of execution of sentence of death pre­
sented to Justice Alito and by him referred to the Court is treated
as an application for stay pending appeal in the Eighth Circuit. The
application is granted pending the disposition of petitioner’s appeal.
Petitioner’s complaint alleges that Missouri’s method of execution vio­
lates the Eighth Amendment as applied to a person with his particular
medical condition. A supporting afﬁdavit by a medical expert states
that “[a]s a result of Mr. Johnson’s brain tumor, brain defect, and brain
scar, a substantial risk of serious harm will occur during his execution
as a result of a violent seizure that may be induced by [the] Pentobarbi­
tal injection.” Because petitioner’s complaint was dismissed for failure
to state a claim, the State was not required to submit any evidence
refuting this allegation. In the currently pending appeal, the Court of
Appeals will be required to decide whether petitioner’s complaint was
properly dismissed for failure to state a claim or whether the case
should have been permitted to progress to the summary judgment
stage.


                       Order in Pending Case
  No. 15A478. Ernest Lee Johnson, Applicant v. Cindy Grifﬁth, War­
den. Application for stay of execution of sentence of death presented
to Justice Alito and by him referred to the Court denied.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

  Present: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Kennedy, Justice Thomas,
Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, Justice Alito, Justice Sotomayor, and
Justice Kagan.
  The Chief Justice said:
  “The memorial drapery on the bench and chair beside me signiﬁes
mourning for a Justice who has died in active service on the Court.
Today, it marks the loss of our friend and colleague, Antonin Scalia,
who died unexpectedly on February 13, 2016.”
  “Justice Scalia was born in Trenton, New Jersey, on March 11, 1936,
to parents of Italian descent. He attended public grade school in
Queens, New York, and then a Jesuit military school in Manhattan,
graduating ﬁrst in his class. He enrolled at Georgetown University,
graduating summa cum laude and as valedictorian in 1957. He next
attended Harvard Law School, graduating magna cum laude in 1960.”
  “While at Harvard, he met Maureen McCarthy, and they married in
1960. Their devoted union produced nine beloved children: Ann For­
rest; Eugene; John Francis; Catherine Elisabeth; Mary Clare; Paul
David; Matthew; Christopher James; and Margaret Jane.”
  “After graduating from law school, Justice Scalia embarked on a ca­
reer in private practice in Cleveland, Ohio, but his love of knowledge
drew him to academia. In 1967, he received an appointment to the
faculty of the University of Virginia Law School. After four years of
teaching and writing, he entered public service as General Counsel of
the White House Ofﬁce of Telecommunications Policy, at the dawn of
the cable television age. He later served as Chairman of the Adminis­
trative Conference of the United States, and as Assistant Attorney
General for the Ofﬁce of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice.
In 1976, during his tenure at the Justice Department, Justice Scalia
argued his ﬁrst and only Supreme Court case. He prevailed, establish­
ing a perfect record before the Court.”
  “Justice Scalia returned to teaching as Professor of Law at the Uni­
versity of Chicago Law School. In 1982, President Reagan appointed
him to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit. On June 24, 1986, President Reagan nominated him to this
Court. Justice Scalia took his seat on September 26 of that year, becom­
ing the 103rd Justice to serve on this Court.”
496                     MONDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 2016

  “Justice Scalia devoted nearly 30 years of his life to this Court in
service to the country he so loved. He authored 292 majority opinions
for the Court. He was also known, on occasion, to dissent. We remem­
ber his incisive intellect, his agile wit, and his captivating prose. But
we cannot forget his irrepressible spirit. He was our man for all sea­
sons, and we shall miss him beyond measure. We extend our condo­
lences to his wife Maureen, his children, and the entire Scalia family.”
  “At an appropriate time, the traditional memorial service of the
Court and the bar will be held in this courtroom.”
  “And now we turn to the business of the Court.”

   Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Alito joins, concurring in the
decision to grant, vacate, and remand in this case: The Court has held
the petitions in these and many other cases pending the decision in
Montgomery v. Louisiana, 577 U. S. ––– (2016). In holding these peti­
tions and now vacating and remanding the judgment below, the Court
has not assessed whether petitioners’ asserted entitlement to retroac­
tive relief “is properly presented in the case.” Id., at ––– (slip op., at
13). On remand, courts should understand that the Court’s disposition
of these petitions does not reﬂect any view regarding petitioners’ enti­
tlement to relief. The Court’s disposition does not, for example, address
whether an adequate and independent state ground bars relief,
whether petitioners forfeited or waived any entitlement to relief (by,
for example, entering into a plea agreement waiving any entitlement
to relief), or whether petitioners’ sentences actually qualify as manda­
tory life without parole sentences.

writ of certiorari to the 29th Judicial District Court of Louisiana, Par­
ish of St. Charles. Petition for writ of certiorari granted. Judgment

siana, Parish of St. Charles for further consideration in light of Mont­
gomery v. Louisiana, 577 U. S. ––– (2016).
   Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Alito joins, concurring in the

relief. The Court’s disposition does not, for example, address whether
an adequate and independent state ground bars relief, whether peti­
tioner forfeited or waived any entitlement to relief (by, for example,
entering into a plea agreement waiving any entitlement to relief), or
whether petitioner’s sentence actually qualiﬁes as a mandatory life
without parole sentence.
   No. 14–1196. Charles Lewis, Petitioner v. Michigan. On petition for
writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Michigan. Petition for writ
of certiorari granted. Judgment vacated, and case remanded to the
Supreme Court of Michigan for further consideration in light of Mont­
gomery v. Louisiana, 577 U. S. ––– (2016).

without parole sentence.

   The parties are directed to ﬁle supplemental briefs that address
whether and how contraceptive coverage may be obtained by petition­
ers’ employees through petitioners’ insurance companies, but in a way
that does not require any involvement of petitioners beyond their own
decision to provide health insurance without contraceptive coverage to
their employees.
   Petitioners with insured plans are currently required to submit a
form either to their insurer or to the Federal Government (naming
petitioners’ insurance company), stating that petitioners object on reli­
gious grounds to providing contraceptive coverage. The parties are
directed to address whether contraceptive coverage could be provided
to petitioners’ employees, through petitioners’ insurance companies,
without any such notice from petitioners.
   For example, the parties should consider a situation in which peti­
tioners would contract to provide health insurance for their employees,
and in the course of obtaining such insurance, inform their insurance
company that they do not want their health plan to include contracep­
tive coverage of the type to which they object on religious grounds.
Petitioners would have no legal obligation to provide such contracep­
tive coverage, would not pay for such coverage, and would not be re­
quired to submit any separate notice to their insurer, to the Federal
Government, or to their employees. At the same time, petitioners’ in­
surance company—aware that petitioners are not providing certain
670                       TUESDAY, MARCH 29, 2016

contraceptive coverage on religious grounds—would separately notify
petitioners’ employees that the insurance company will provide cost-
free contraceptive coverage, and that such coverage is not paid for by
petitioners and is not provided through petitioners’ health plan.
  The parties may address other proposals along similar lines, avoiding
repetition of discussion in prior brieﬁng.
  The briefs, limited to a single brief 25 pages in length for petitioners,
and a single brief 20 pages in length for respondents, are to be ﬁled
simultaneously with the Clerk and served upon counsel for the other
parties on or before April 12, 2016. Reply briefs, limited to a single
brief 10 pages in length for petitioners and for respondents, are to be
ﬁled simultaneously with the Clerk and served upon opposing counsel
for the other parties on or before April 20, 2016.

Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, Justice Alito, Justice Sotomayor, and

                       Order in Pending Case
   No. 15A999. Marc Veasey, et al., Applicants v. Greg Abbott, Gover­
nor of Texas, et al. Application to vacate the stay entered by the United
States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit on October 14, 2014, pre­
sented to Justice Thomas and by him referred to the Court is denied.
The Court recognizes the time constraints the parties confront in light
of the scheduled elections in November, 2016. If, on or before July 20,
2016, the Court of Appeals has neither issued an opinion on the merits
of the case nor issued an order vacating or modifying the current stay
order, an aggrieved party may seek interim relief from this Court by
ﬁling an appropriate application. An aggrieved party may also seek
interim relief if any change in circumstances before that date supports
further arguments respecting the stay order.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

  Present: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Kennedy, Justice Thomas,
Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, Justice Alito, Justice Sotomayor, and
Justice Kagan.
  The Chief Justice said:
  “We have issued orders today, they have been duly entered and certi­
ﬁed, and ﬁled with the Clerk.”

                Certiorari—Summary Dispositions

   No. 15–1. Shermaine Ali Johnson, Petitioner v. Carl Manis, Warden.
On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals
for the Fourth Circuit. Petition for writ of certiorari granted. Judg­
ment vacated, and case remanded to the United States Court of Ap­
peals for the Fourth Circuit for further consideration in light of Mont­
gomery v. Louisiana, 577 U. S. ––– (2016).
   Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Alito joins, concurring in the
decision to grant, vacate, and remand in this case: The Court has held
the petition in this and many other cases pending the decision in Mont­
gomery v. Louisiana, 577 U. S. ––– (2016). In holding this petition and
now vacating and remanding the judgment below, the Court has not
assessed whether petitioner’s asserted entitlement to retroactive relief
“is properly presented in the case.” Id., at ––– (slip op., at 13). On
remand, courts should understand that the Court’s disposition of this
petition does not reﬂect any view regarding petitioner’s entitlement to
relief. The Court’s disposition does not, for example, address whether
an adequate and independent state ground bars relief, whether peti­
tioner forfeited or waived any entitlement to relief (by, for example,
entering into a plea agreement waiving any entitlement to relief), or
whether petitioner’s sentence actually qualiﬁes as a mandatory life
without parole sentence.
   Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas joins, concurring in the
decision to grant, vacate and remand. I concur in the decision to grant,
vacate and remand. See Adams v. Alabama, 578 U. S. ––– (2016) (Alito,
J., concurring).
   Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, concurring in
the decision to grant, vacate and remand. I concur in the decision to
grant, vacate and remand. See Adams v. Alabama, 578 U. S. ––– (2016)
(Sotomayor, J., concurring).
826                          MONDAY, MAY 23, 2016

   No. 15–620. Eric A. Jones, et al., Petitioners v. Pamela Gillie, et al.
On petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals
for the Sixth Circuit. Petition for writ of certiorari granted. Judgment
vacated, and case remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for
the Sixth Circuit for further consideration in light of Sheriff v. Gillie,
578 U. S. ––– (2016).
   No. 15–785. Edward Pundt, Individually and as Representative of
Plan Participants and Plan Beneﬁciaries of Verizon Management Pen­
sion Plan, Petitioner v. Verizon Communications, Inc., et al. On petition
for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the
Fifth Circuit. Petition for writ of certiorari granted. Judgment vacated,
and case remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit for further consideration in light of Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578
U. S. ––– (2016).
   No. 15–1100. Catholic Health Care System, et al., Petitioners v. Syl­
via Burwell, Secretary of Health and Human Services, et al. On peti­
tion for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit. Petition for writ of certiorari granted. Judgment
vacated, and case remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit in light of Zubik v. Burwell, 578 U. S. ––– (2016).
Nothing in the Zubik opinion, or in the opinions or orders of the courts
below, is to affect the ability of the Government to ensure that women
covered by petitioners’ health plans “obtain, without cost, the full
range of FDA approved contraceptives.” Wheaton College v. Burwell,
573 U. S. –––, ––– (2014) (slip op., at 1). Through this litigation, petition­
ers have made the Government aware of their view that they meet
“the requirements for exemption from the contraceptive coverage re­
quirement on religious grounds.” Id., at ––– (slip op., at 2). Nothing in
the Zubik opinion, or in the opinions or orders of the courts below,
“precludes the Government from relying on this notice, to the extent
it considers it necessary, to facilitate the provision of full contraceptive
coverage” going forward. Ibid. Because the Government may rely on
this notice, the Government may not impose taxes or penalties on peti­
tioners for failure to provide the relevant notice.
   Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, concurs in the
decision to grant, vacate, and remand in this case for the reasons ex­
pressed in Zubik v. Burwell, 578 U. S. ––– (2016) (Sotomayor, J.,
concurring).
   No. 15–1131. Michigan Catholic Conference, et al., Petitioners v. Syl­
via Burwell, Secretary of Health and Human Services, et al. On peti­
tion for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for
                             MONDAY, MAY 23, 2016                        827
the Sixth Circuit. Petition for writ of certiorari granted. Judgment
vacated, and case remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for
the Sixth Circuit in light of Zubik v. Burwell, 578 U. S. ––– (2016).

pressed in Zubik v. Burwell, 578 U. S. ––– (2016) (Sotomayor, J.,
concurring).

tition for writ of certiorari to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Ala­
bama. Motion of petitioner for leave to proceed in forma pauperis
and petition for writ of certiorari granted. Judgment vacated, and case
remanded to the Court of Criminal Appeals of Alabama for further
consideration in light of Montgomery v. Louisiana, 577 U. S. –––
(2016).
