Mr. Justice Black and Mr. Justice Douglas dissenting:
Respondent Jackson brought a diversity action in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia claim-
ing damages from the railroad for personal injuries. The trial
judge charged the jury under the applicable Georgia compara-
tive negligence statute ¹ that if the plaintiff had been himself
negligent, though less so than the defendant, his recovery "would
be reduced in proportion to the amount of default attributable
to him." The jury returned a verdict of $2,500 although there
had been medical expenses of $1,300, evidence of lost earnings
of $12,000, and other damage alleged up to a total of $100,000.
Claiming that the instruction on comparative negligence was im-
proper and accounted for the "grossly inadequate" award, plain-
tiff moved for a new trial. The District Court denied the motion
but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that under either a
federal or a state standard the evidence failed to show any negli-
gence of the plaintiff. In our judgment this reversal denied the
railroad its right to a trial of the question by the jury in the
United States District Court as guaranteed by the Seventh
Amendment to the Constitution. See Simler v. Conner, 372 U.S.
221. Because of the importance of preserving this constitutional
right we would grant certiorari and affirm the District Court's
ruling on this issue.

No. 169, Misc. Frank Jimmy Snider, Jr., petitioner, v. W. K. Cun-
ningham, Jr., Superintendent, Virginia State Penitentiary. Petition
for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia
denied. Mr. Justice Goldberg, with whom Mr. Justice Douglas and
Mr. Justice Brennan join, is of the opinion that the petition should
be granted for the reasons expressed in his dissenting opinion in
Rudolph v. Alabama, No. 308, Misc., decided this date.
No. 308, Misc. Frank Lee Rudolph, petitioner, v. Alabama. Pe-
tition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Alabama denied.
Mr. Justice Goldberg, with whom Mr. Justice Douglas and Mr. Justice
Brennan join, dissenting:
I would grant certiorari in this case and in Snider v. Cunning-
ham, 169, Misc., to consider whether the Eighth and Fourteenth
Amendments to the United States Constitution permit the im-
position of the death penalty on a convicted rapist who has neither
taken nor endangered human life.
The following questions, inter alia, seem relevant and worthy
of argument and consideration:
(1) In light of the trend both in this country and throughout.
the world against punishing rape by death,1 does the imposition
of the death penalty by those States which retain it for rape
violate "evolving standards of decency that mark the progress
of [our] maturing society," or "standards of decency more or
less universally accepted?" 3
1 The United Nations recently conducted a survey on the laws, regulations and
practices relating to capital punishment throughout the world. In addition to the
United States, 65 countries and territories responded. All but five-Nationalist
China, Northern Rhodesia, Nyasaland, Republic of South Africa, and the United
States-reported that their laws no longer permit the imposition of the death penalty
for rape.
The following of the United States reported that their laws no longer permit the
imposition of the death penalty for rape: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado,
Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Massa-
chusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire New Jersey,
New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota,
Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. The laws of the
remaining States permit the imposition of the death penalty for rape, but some
States do not, in fact, impose it. United Nations, Capital Punishment (prepared
by Mr. Marc Ancel, Justice of the French Supreme Court) (N.Y. 1962) 38, 71–75.
2 Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 101 (opinion of WARREN, C. J., joined by Justices
BLACK, DOUGLAS, and Whittaker).
3 Francis v. Resweber, 329 U.S. 495, 469 (Frankfurter, J., concurring). See
Weems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349, 373:
"Legislation, both statutory and constitutional, is enacted, it is true, from an
experience of evils, but its general language should not, therefore, be necessarily
confined to the form that evil had theretofore taken. Time works changes, brings
into existence new conditions and purpose. Therefore, a principle to be vital must
be capable of wider application than the mischief which gave it birth. This is
peculiarly true of constitutions. They are not ephemeral enactments, designed to
meeting passing occasions. They are, to use the words of Chief Justice Marshall,

(2) Is the taking of human life to protect a value other than
human life consistent with the constitutional proscription against
"punishments which by their excessive *** severity are greatly
disproportioned to the offenses charged?” 4
(3) Can the permissible aims of punishment (e.g., deterrence,
isolation, rehabilitation) 5 be achieved as effectively by punishing
rape less severely than by death (e.g., by life imprisonment); * if
so, does the imposition of the death penalty for rape constitute
"unnecessary cruelty?" 7
LEAVE TO FILE PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI DENIED
No. 532, Misc. James Burks, petitioner, v. Frank J. Pate, War-
den. Motion for leave to file petition for writ of certiorari denied.
LEAVE TO FILE PETITIONS FOR WRITS OF HABEAS CORPUS DENIED
No. 523, Misc. Alan Benjamin Luckman, petitioner, v. California
et al.;
No. 546, Misc. Robert L. Stanton, petitioner, v. Ross V. Randolph,
Warden;
No. 601, Misc. Lewis Talmadge Hill, petitioner, v. George J. Beto,
Director, Texas Department of Corrections;
'designed to approach immortality as nearly as human institutions can approach it.'
The future is their care and provision for events of good and bad tendencies of which
no prophecy can be made. In the application of a constitution, therefore, our con-
templation cannot be only of what has been but of what may be. Under any other
rule a constitution would indeed be as easy of application as it would be deficient
in efficacy and power. Its general principles would have little value and be con-
verted by precedent into impotent and lifeless formulas. Rights declared in words
might be lost in reality."
Also see Ex parte Wilson, 114 U.S. 417, 427–428:
"What punishments may be considered as infamous may be affected by the
changes of opinions from one age to another. In former times, being put in the
stocks was not considered as necessarily infamous * * *. Bụt at the present day
[it] might be thought an infamous punishment."
4 Weems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349, 371. Cf. Lambert v. California, 355 U.S.
225, 231 (dissenting opinion of Frankfurter, J.).
See e.g., Williams v. New York, 337 U.S. 241; Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 111
(concurring opinion of BRENNAN, J.); Blyew v. United States, 13 Wall. 581, 600.
* The United Nations Report on Capital Punishment noted: "In Canada, rape
ceased to be punishable with death in 1954: it is reported that there were 37 con-
victions for rape in 1950, 44 in 1953 and only 27 in 1954, the year of abolition;
from 1957 to 1959 a steady decrease in convictions was noted (from 56 to 44),
while in the same period the population of Canada increased by 27 percent.” United
Nations, Capital Punishment, supra, note 1, at 54-55.
Such statistics must of course be regarded with caution. See, e.g., Royall Com-
mission Report on Capital Punishment (1953) 24; Hart, Murder and Its Punish-
ment, 12 N.W.L. Rev. 433, 457 (1957); Allen, Review, 10 Stan. L. Rev. 595, 600
(1958). In Canada, for example, the death sentence was rarely imposed for rape
even prior to its formal abolition in 1954. In 1961 there was a slight increase in
the number of convictions for rape. See United Nations, Capital Punishment, supra,
note 1, at 55.

No. 483. Ng Kam Fook et al., petitioners, v. P. A. Esperdy, as Dis-
trict Director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Peti-
tion for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit denied. Mr. Justice Douglas dissenting:
Section 243 (a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (66 Stat.
163, 212, 8 U. S. C. § 1253(a)) provides in pertinent part:
❝*** deportation of such alien shall be directed to any coun-
try of which such alien is a subject national, or citizen if such
country is willing to accept him into its territory."
Respondent and both lower federal courts have determined that
petitioners, who were both born on the mainland of China, who came
to the United States as crewmen in 1953 and 1955, and who have never
resided in Formosa, are "subject nation[s] or citizen [s]" of the Re-
public of China, located on Formosa. Accordingly, when the Repub-
lic of China refused to accept petitioners, they were ordered deported,
under other provisions of the Act, to Hong Kong and the Nether-
lands regimes to which they have never been subject-either as citi-
zens or as nationals, petitioners having been born on the mainland of
China, as I have said.
The decision below is predicated in part upon nonrecognition of the
Peking regime by the United States, and the fear that a contrary hold-
ing would require a preliminary inquiry concerning its willingness to
accept petitioners "which might impliedly suggest recognition and
thus might embarrass the decisions of the Executive Department as to
foreign policies." 320 F. 2d 86, 89. But that overlooks the fact that
since 1955 we have been in regular contact with the Peking regime,
first by Alexis Johnson, our former Ambassador to Czechoslovakia and
now by John M. Cabot, our Ambassador to Poland; and, as the press
has related, the matters discussed have reached far more delicate
questions than this one, which, though minor, touches a basic human
right.
The proper construction of the statute poses a substantial question,²
which should be considered by this Court.
I would grant certiorari.
1 See Department of State, Release Aug. 14, 1963, interview of U. Alexis Johnson by
Irving Chapman; Washington Post, Sept. 12, 1963, p. A-24; New York Times, Aug. 8, 1963,
pp. 1-2.
³ Chief Judge Lumbard stated in dissent, 320 F. 2d 86, 90 :
"For the reasons stated in my concurring opinion in Leong Leun Do v. Esperdy, 309 F.
2d 467, 475, 477-479 (2 Cir. 1962), I would hold that for purposes of the present pro-
ceeding, 'the Chinese mainland is a country of which an alien may be a subject national
or citizen.' Id. 309 F. 2d at 478. It seems to me that some agencies of the United States
government could, directly or through intermediaries, contact agents of the Communist
government without implying recognition. If such a procedure is rejected by the execu-
tive branch, then, under the present statute, the alien should not be deported. This area
of the law seems to be one which particularly requires legislative attention."

had reached the statutory age, retired from the service of the Supreme
Court as of December 31, 1963.
“Mr. Wyatt, the twelfth Reporter of Decisions in the history of the
Court, has served the Court well in that capacity for the past 18 years.
He has been diligent and faithful in the work of preparing the Court's
decisions for final publication, and has supervised the publishing of
49 volumes of the U.S. Reports. His efforts have helped to perpetuate
a part of the Court's history, and he is entitled to great satisfaction
in this accomplishment.
"We wish for him many years of happiness in the leisure he has
earned and continued success in anything he may undertake in the
future.

MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK concurs,
dissenting.
Like United States v. Shotwell Mfg. Co., 355 U.S. 233, 234, “This
case presents an unusual question involving the integrity of a criminal
trial in the federal courts.'
"
Petitioner was convicted by a jury of violating 21 U.S.C. § 176(a).
smuggling marihuana into the United States. The Court of Appeals
affirmed. 317 F.2d 865. A principal witness for the Government was
a woman, Janet Watkins, arrested with petitioner, the marihuana hav-
ing been discovered in her hair. Before petitioner's trial, she pleaded
1

MONDAY, JANUARY 6, 1964
152
guilty to transporting marihuana without having paid a transfer tax,
and the smuggling charge against her was then dismissed. At the trial,
she testified on cross-examination that her guilty plea was still in effect,
that no action, personally or through an attorney, had been taken to
withdraw it, and that she did not then intend to withdraw it. The
judge instructed the jury that he had accepted the plea only after she
admitted knowing that the marihuana was in her hair.
Following affirmance in the Court of Appeals, petitioner filed two
petitions for rehearing and a motion to supplement the record, point-
ing out that the judge who presided at his trial had subsequently
granted the woman's unopposed motion to withdraw the guilty plea
and that, on the Government's motion, the indictment against her was
dismissed. In support of his request that the case be remanded to the
Federal District Court for an inquiry into the propriety of what had
transpired, petitioner presented this newly discovered letter from one
of the woman's attorneys to the other:
"Since Janet pled guilty she has had a conference with Hugh
Johnson, Probation Officer, who believes that she was a victim
of circumstances the same as you and I believe. After conferring
with the Probation Officer he was able to have a conference with
Judge Connally 1 concerning the matter, who, in turn, had a
conference with Janet personally. It is my understanding, al-
though not confirmed, that Judge Connally is of the same opinion
as we are. After conferring with Judge Connally we were able
to talk to Bill Jackson of the Federal District Attorney's office,
who is also convinced that Janet is a victim of circumstances and
not guilty.
"The present course of action is as follows: Janet will be a wit-
ness for the Government against Mr. Beck. After she testifies
against him Janet will withdraw her plea of guilty to not guilty,
and the cases will be tried before the court if tried at all. Al-
though the Government has not promised anything, they have as
much as indicated her cases will be dismissed. ***”
Had all these facts been known and disclosed at the time of the trial
they might have had an effect on the outcome. For the case was
submitted to the jury on two separate theories the petitioner alone
smuggled the marihuana into the United States and that he aided
and abetted Janet Watkins in doing so. The jury returned a general
verdict; and on appeal the Court of Appeals rejected the argument
that the case had been improperly submitted on the aider and abetter
theory. 317 F.2d, at 870-871.
The Government argues that petitioner should have proceeded by
filing a motion for a new trial. See Rule 33, Fed. Rules Crim. Proc.
1 Judge Connally presided at petitioner Beck's trial in this case.

REHEARING GRANTED
No. 323. Shenandoah Valley Broadcasting Inc., et al., petitioners,
v. American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. Peti-
tion for rehearing granted and the last sentence of the per curiam
opinion announced on October 21, 1963, is amended to read: "The
petition is therefore granted and the judgment is reversed and the
cause remanded to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings in
conformity with this opinion."
MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK joins, dis-
senting from the order granting rehearing and from the modification
of the original opinion.
In my view, the cause was properly remanded "to the Court of Ap-
peals for consideration on its merits,” 375 U.S. 39, 41, and there is no
reason to modify the original opinion.
Respondent requests the change in order to be free upon remand
to argue to the Court of Appeals that petitioners originally failed to
perfect their appeal to that court because they did not comply with
the 30-day requirement of Rule 73(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure. The Rule provides that:
"When an appeal is permitted by law from a district court to
a court of appeals the time within which an appeal may be taken
shall be 30 days from the entry of the judgment appealed from
ર

MONDAY, JANUARY 20, 1964
179
***"
unless a shorter time is provided by law, except that in any action
in which the United States or an officer or agency thereof is a party
the time as to all parties shall be 60 days from such entry,
[Emphasis added.]
Petitioners, having filed their notice of appeal with the Court of
Appeals more than 30 days but less than 60 days after the entry of
the District Court order dismissing their petition, contend that the
60-day limitation applies, that their appeal to the Court of Appeals
was timely, and, therefore, that this Court properly remanded the case
for consideration on the merits. Petitioners argue that the proceed-
ings they had instituted in the District Court must be regarded as a
continuation of the original suit brought by the United States, that
the United States is a "party" to the action within the meaning of 28
U.S.C. § 2107 and Rule 73 (a), and, therefore, all the parties have 60
days from the entry of judgment to file a notice of appeal.
The Court in granting rehearing does not pass on the merits of
these contentions, leaving them for consideration by the Court of Ap-
peals. I do not believe that the Court of Appeals need consider this
procedural question and wish to point out why our original opinion
properly directed that court to consider the case on its merits.
We are here confronted with a situation in which, at the time when
review of a District Court decision was sought, two questions con-
cerning appellate jurisdiction had not definitely been settled. First,
it was not altogether clear whether review in this type of action should
be sought in the Court of Appeals or directly in this Court under
§ 2 of the Expediting Act, 32 Stat. 823, as amended, 15 U.S.C. § 29.
To avoid being impaled upon the horns of this procedural dilemma,
petitioners attempted to pursue both routes. We have now clarified
the law and held that the Expediting Act was inapplicable and that
review should proceed through the Court of Appeals. 375 U.S. 39.
Second, even if the first question had not been beset by uncertainties,
it was not clearly settled whether, in proceeding to the Court of Ap-
peals, petitioners' case would come within the 60-day, as opposed to
the 30-day, appeal limitation. Under these circumstances, given the
prior complexities and our decision that the case is one to be reviewed
by the Court of Appeals, we should now issue an order which will
insure that petitioners' right to appellate review is properly safe.
guarded. We have the power to do precisely that.
The Court has frequently held, in cases involving attempted direct
appeals from three-judge District Courts to this Court, that "where
the question of jurisdiction was not obviously settled by prior deci-
sions," the Court will enter "an order framed to save appellants their
proper remedies." Phillips v. United States, 312 U.S. 246, 254. See
also Walling v. James V. Reuter, Inc., 321 U.S. 671, 676–678; Okla-
N

"
homa Gas & Electric Co. v. Oklahoma Packing Co., 292 U.S. 386, 392;
Gully v. Interstate Natural Gas Co., 292 U.S. 16, 19. To accomplish
this the Court has remanded "the cause to the court which heard the
case so that it may enter a fresh decree from which appellants may, if
they wish, perfect a timely appeal to the circuit court of appeals."
Phillips v. United States, supra, at 254. Here, as in the cited decisions,
we have a case in which, as a result of uncertainties in federal appellate
procedures and without unreasonable action by petitioners, it is con-
ceivable under the Court's modified opinion that an appellate review
of the merits of the case may not only be unnecessarily delayed but even
ultimately thwarted. What we have accomplished indirectly in the
cited cases to the end of safeguarding the statutory right to appellate
review―we should be able to do directly in the exercise of our powers
of appellate supervision. Compare Bartone v. United States,
375 U.S. 52.
A remand to the Court of Appeals for consideration on the merits is
expressly authorized by 28 U.S.C. § 2106 which provides that:
"The Supreme Court or any other court of appellate jurisdic-
tion may affirm, modify, vacate, set aside, or reverse any judgment,
decree, or order of a court lawfully brought before it for review,
and may remand the cause and direct the entry of such appro-
priate judgment, decree, or order, or require such further pro-
ceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances."
The decisions in the above-cited cases establish that this Court has
on numerous occasions made "such disposition of the case as justice
requires" as is authorized by the statute. Walling v. James V. Reuter,
Inc., supra, at 676. In the present case there can be no doubt that a
hearing on the merits would "be just under the circumstances." The
fact that this case has proven to involve two procedural difficulties, in-
stead of simply one as in other instances, should not so confuse the
matter as conceivably to defeat the realization of appellate review on
the merits. This case, which has been in this Court twice and which
will now be in the Court of Appeals for a second time, should be de-
cided in that court on the merits. The right to appellate review
should no longer be delayed or denied as a result of uncertainties in
federal procedures.

MONDAY, APRIL 20, 1964
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Present: Mr. Chief Justice Warren, Mr. Justice Black, Mr. Justice
Douglas, Mr. Justice Clark, Mr. Justice Harlan, Mr. Justice Brennan,
Mr. Justice Stewart, Mr. Justice White, and Mr. Justice Goldberg.
Mr. Attorney General Kennedy addressed the Court as follows:
"Mr. Chief Justice:
"May it please the Court. On behalf of the members of this Bar
and of lawyers throughout the United States, I come here to join in
paying tribute to Justice Douglas, who is celebrating the completion
of 25 years of distinguished service on the Court. It is an unusual
circumstance that just 2 years ago we were paying similar tribute to
Mr. Justice Black.
"Justice Douglas came to the Court in the year 1939. He was able
to draw upon a unique background, bringing with him knowledge and
experience that were greatly needed in the United States at that time.
His expertness in the fields of economic regulation and administrative
law were of particular value and enabled him to make a vital contribu-
tion to the progress we were seeking to achieve during those very
difficult days.
"I would also like to add a brief personal note. I think it was my
father who was responsible for bringing Justice Douglas to Washing-
ton a number of years ago, when I was about 6 years old. He came
on the Court when I was 13, and I remember that bright day even now.
He has been a great friend of our family for many years.
"I also remember vividly my trips with him around the world-not
merely because of what I gained personally, but primarily because I
witnessed the way in which he presented a picture of the United States
to the people of other countries. He was a man who was able to tell
them, in ways they understood, of our views and beliefs. He could
speak with wisdom of our laws and explain our system of government.
He could talk to them also, in every-day terms, of many other matters
in which they were deeply interested-how much cotton was produced
per acre in South Carolina or how much wheat in Nebraska. The
many who have seen him in his travels, read his books, and heard his
friendly words have been moved and inspired.
"He has been a great credit not only to this Court, but as a citizen
of the United States and of the world.
"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."

The Chief Justice said:
"Mr. Attorney General:
272
"It is thoughtful of you to publicly remind us of this important
milestone in the life of the Court, and it is generous of you to speak
of our Brother Douglas in such felicitous terms. We heartily join
you both in the timing and in the fervor of your remarks. Twenty-
five years of devoted service to the highest Court of the Nation should
not be passed over without comment. Only 18 of the 94 men appointed
to the Court have achieved that distinction, and only 5 of them—
Holmes, McReynolds, Van Devanter, Black and Douglas-were ap-
pointed in this century.
"When Mr. Justice Douglas, succeeding Justice Brandeis, took his
seat on the Court, Mr. Justice McReynolds was the Senior Justice.
Appointed in 1914, he had sat for 7 years with Chief Justice Edward
D. White, who was appointed an Associate in 1894. Thus, as evidence
of the continuing nature of the Court, it should be appropriate to
point out that Mr. Justice Douglas served with one who had in turn sat
for 7 years with Justice White, who was appointed 70 years ago.
This continuity of service is one of the strong factors which brings
stability and tradition to our Court.
"It has been said that in a cyclic way every basic problem of the
American people eventually reaches the Supreme Court. If this is
true and there is evidence to sustain it-Mr. Justice Douglas has
served through more than one of these cycles. The last quarter of a
century has taken him through depression, hot wars, cold wars, and
social and economic revolutions. He has written for the Court or in
dissent in many hundreds of cases. His work is a vital part of the
jurisprudence of the Court. It is recorded in more than 70 volumes
of the United States Supreme Court Reports. His opinions will be
read and studied so long as the Constitution is the guiding light of
our Nation.
"This is neither the time nor the place to appraise his work. That
will be done by lawyers, scholars, courts and the people in the full-
ness of time. One does not try to determine the record of a swimmer
when he is in midstream, particularly when he is swimming against
unknown currents. Mr. Justice Douglas is in midstream. We know
that by nature he recoils against merely swimming downstream. He
will continue to swim strongly and purposefully.
"We join with you, Mr. Attorney General, and with the Bar in
wishing him continued success and happiness on the Court for many
years to come."

No. 16, Original. State of Arizona, plaintiff, v. State of Califor-

No. 1028. Stassen for President Citizens Committee, petitioner, v.
Frank M. Jordan, Secretary of the State of California. Dissenting
opinion by Mr. Justice Douglas from the order of April 24, 1964,
denying certiorari, with whom the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice
Goldberg concur.
I would have granted certiorari in this case as the Journal entry for
April 24, 1964, shows; and I file this statement of reasons pursuant to
the reservation made at the time.
It is now settled, after a period of some uncertainty (cf. Newberry
v. United States, 256 U.S. 232, 250), that a primary election for repre-
sentatives for the Congress is a part of the election process guaranteed
by Art. I, §§ 2 and 4 of the Constitution (United States v. Classic, 313
U.S. 299); and the same reasoning applies to primary elections for
Senators pursuant to the Seventeenth Amendment. Terry v. Adams,
345 U.S. 461, 468; Gray v. Sanders, 372 U.S. 368,380.
We deal here not with the primary election for either members of
Congress or the Senate but with the nominating process for a primary
election in which convention delegates favorable to a particular presi-
1
1 The California Elections Code (1961) provides that nomination papers shall be left
with the county clerk of the county in which they are circulated at least 60 days prior
to the presidential primary. § 6081. The nomination papers in the present case are
required to be signed by not less than one-half of one percent and not more than two
percent of the vote for the Republican Governor at the last general election. § 6080 (a),
§ 6082. And it is provided in § 6087 that a "verified nomination paper is prima facie

dential candidate are chosen, the convention choice ultimately to com-
pete for President in an election under Article II of the Constitution―
a procedure that Congress has regulated in detail. See 3 U.S.C. § 1
et seq.
The Court in the Classic case said:
"That the free choice by the people of representatives in Con-
gress subject only to the restrictions to be found in §§ 2 and 4 of
Article I and elsewhere in the Constitution, was one of the great
purposes of our constitutional scheme of government cannot be
doubted. We cannot regard it as any the less the constitutional
purpose, or its words as any the less guarantying the integrity of
that choice, when a state, exercising its privilege in the absence
of Congressional action, charges the mode of choice from a single
step, a general election, to two, of which the first is the choice
at a primary of those candidates from whom, as a second step, the
representative in Congress is to be chosen at the election." 313
U.S., at 316–317.
The "mode of choice" (id., at 316) in California for Presidential
candidates is first the nominating petition, second the primary, third,
the convention, and fourth, the general election. That fact that the
"mode of choice" is enlarged to four stages is irrelevant to the con-
stitutional purpose to protect "the free choice" of the people (ibid.)
in federal elections.
California, zealous to protect that right, creates the presumption
that signatures on a petition are signatures of bona fide electors.
Elections Code § 6087.2
In this case, however, the presumption is defeated, not because the
signatories to the nominating petitions are found to be unqualified
but for reasons that relate solely to the administrative convenience
of the county clerks. They certify as qualified voters only those that
their office has indexed; and concededly the indices are not up to date.
A voter recently moving to a new district and registering in time
nevertheless loses his franchise-not because of any disqualification
or irregularity, not because of his failure to do something required,
and not because of his commission of a wrongful act. He has done
all in his power to qualify as a voter; but his vote is not counted in
the nominating stage of the electoral process merely on account of
the laziness of the county clerks. This to me is at least arguably an
impermissible state denial of a federal right; the question is substan-
tial; and I regret it was not argued and decided on the merits.

evidence that the signatures are genuine and that the persons signing it are voters, until
it is otherwise proved by comparison of the signatures with the affidavits of registration
in the office of the county clerk."

California in denying relief wrote no opinion. See Calif. 2d

No. 1035. Joseph Bertman, doing business as Bertman Food Prod-

the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied.
Mr. JUSTICE Black, with whom Mr. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and Mr. Jus-
TICE GOLDBERG join, dissenting from the denial of certiorari.
The United States contracted with Bertman, the petitioner here,
for the delivery of imported tomato paste. Bertman in turn con-
tracted with J. A. Kirsch Co. to supply the paste. After the United
States had taken delivery, it claimed that the paste was spoiled, and it
sued Bertman for breach of contract. In addition to defending against
the Government's claims, Bertman brought Kirsch in as a defendant,
claiming that if the paste was defective then the blame rested on
Kirsch and that if the Government recovered against Bertman he in
turn was entitled to recover against Kirsch. After a trial in the
United States District Court, the jury found that the paste was not
defective, and the court entered judgment holding Bertman not liable.

MONDAY, JUNE 22, 1964
394
Since Bertman owed the Government nothing, naturally Kirsch owed
Bertman nothing, and judgment was entered holding that Bertman
should recover nothing from Kirsch. Under 28 U.S.C. § 2107 and
Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 73, a party aggrieved by a judgment of this kind
has sixty days in which to appeal. In this case the only party which
stood to lose by the judgments when entered was the United States.
At some time on the 60th day it filed a notice of appeal with the clerk
of the court. At the moment this appeal was filed, Bertman once
again was subject to the danger of liability which had originally caused
him to bring Kirsch into the suit as a defendant. The natural de-
fensive step for Bertman to take then was to file a notice of appeal
against Kirsch, but notice of the Government's appeal was not served
on Bertman until after the 60 days had passed-too late, both courts
below held, for Bertman to take his appeal. Thus, even though Bert-
man's ability to protect himself against paying for another man's
wrong depended on his having notice of the Government's appeal just
as much as it depended his having notice when he was sued in the first
place, neither the statutes nor the rules required that he have notice
in time to file his own appeal.
I am aware of the argument that an able. alert, ever-diligent lawyer
could have, had he tried hard enough, discovered that the Government
had appealed-even in the closing hours of the sixtieth day. I do not
doubt that had Bertman's counsel been Superman, his X-ray eyes
would have told him that a notice of appeal was being filed blocks
away in the courthouse, or had he been a lawyer with no clients but
Bertman he could have spent the sixtieth day hovering at the clerk's
office to see whether the Government would file a notice of appeal.
But Bertman's counsel (so far as the record shows) is not Superman,
nor should the law expect him to be. The record is barren of any sug-
gestion that he fell short of the standards generally expected of a
capable lawyer. He relied, as lawyers in our system of jurisprudence
are entitled to do, on the principle expressed by Daniel Webster when
he said that due process means a law which "hears before it condemns."
A chance to be heard, of course, requires notice. Bertman had no
notice of the Government's appeal in time to file his own appeal. A
system of appeals which fails to give this notice, whether by statute
or rule, fails to provide the most elemental requirement of due process.
The only construction of this rule consistent with due process and
with the purpose of the Civil Rules to secure the "just . . determi-
nation of every action" 1 would therefore be to hold that Bertman's
filing within a reasonable time after notice was timely. Cf. Fallen v.
United States, No. 210, October Term, 1963, decided this date.

Mr. Justice Harlan, dissenting:
I believe that the issue in this case has an importance which justi-
fies departure from my usual practice of not noting a dissent to a
denial of certiorari with which I do not agree. The issue is whether
this Court's holding in Giedon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, is re-
quired to be given retroactive effect. That question, which is of
continuing concern in the administration of criminal justice in a sub-
stantial number of States, deserves plenary consideration by this
Court, which it has not yet had. See my dissenting opinion in
Pickelsimer v. Wainwright, 375 U.S. 2, 3. I would grant certiorari
and set the case for argument.

No. 639, Misc. Harold Allen Spencer, petitioner, v. California.
Petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of California
denied.
MR. JUSTICE GOLDBERG, dissenting from denial of certiorari.
Petitioner, an indigent defendant, was, after a jury trial, convicted
of murder and sentenced to death. The California Supreme Court
affirmed the conviction, 31 Cal. Rptr. 782, and petitioner seeks a writ
of certiorari.
Prior to the trial, petitioner entered pleas of not guilty and not
guilty by reason of insanity. The court pursuant to California law
thereupon appointed two psychiatrists "to examine the defendant and
investigate his sanity . . . .” On the basis of their examinations and
interviews, the psychiatrists filed a report "stating that in their opin-
ion defendant was sane . . . at the time of the alleged commission of
the crimes." At the start of the trial petitioner withdrew his plea of
not guilty by reason of insanity. Nevertheless, during the guilt phase
of the trial, which under California procedure is separate from the
punishment phase, the State called one of the psychiatrists, who re-
lated incriminating statements "made by defendant in the course of
the psychiatric examination."
Under § 1027 of the California Penal Code, whenever “a defendant
pleads not guilty by reason of insanity the court must select and
appoint two alienists. . . to examine the defendant and investigate
his sanity...." Even if the defendant subsequently withdraws his
insanity plea, the psychiatrists "may be called" to testify concerning
their interviews with the defendant. The defendant may not invoke
any privilege to prevent disclosure of the content of such interviews.
On its face this provision applies equally to affluent as well as to
indigent defendants, for any defendant, interposing a defense of
insanity, is subject to interviews and examinations by state-hired
psychiatrists who may later be called by the State to testify as wit-
nesses against the defendant. However, the interaction of another
California rule, namely, that any communication between a defend-
ant and a privately hired psychiatrist is privileged, see, e. g., Jones v.
Superior Court, 58 Cal. 2d 56, 61, and the California procedure under
§ 1027 creates a critical difference between the affluent defendant and
the indigent defendant. And affluent defendent, before deciding
to interpose an insanity defense, may seek the advise of a private
psychiatrist and, if the defendant thereby determines that there is
no basis for an insanity defense, any incriminating statements made
in the course of the psychiatric examination are privileged and not
admissible in evidence against the defendant. In contrast, an indigent
defendant, unable to retain a private psychiatrist, must, in order to
determine whether he has a basis for an insanity defense, submit

MONDAY, JUNE 22, 1964

to interviews with state-hired psychiatrists. If the indigent defend-
ant then determines that there is no basis for such a defense, not-
withstanding the withdrawal of that defense, any incriminating
statements made in the interviews with the psychiatrists are not priv-
ileged and may be used against the defendant at his trial. An indigent
defendant therefore is often in effect compelled to choose between
foregoing an insanity defense and waiving his privilege against self-
incrimination.
Petitioner contends that the operation of these laws effects an
invidious discrimination between the affluent defendant who is able
to retain a private psychiatrist and the indigent defendant who lacks
funds to do so, in that the latter, but not the former, is required to
surrender his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination as a
condition of ascertaining whether there is any basis for a plea of not
guilty by reason of insanity.
I believe that petitioner's claim raises substantial and important
questions under the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of
the Constitution. See, e. g., Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12; Gideon v.
Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335; Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353; Lane
v. Brown, 372 U.S. 477; Draper v. Washington, 372 U.S. 487. "Both
equal protection and due process emphasize the central aim of our
entire judicial system-all people charged with crime must, so far as
the law is concerned, 'stand on an equality before the bar of justice
in every American court."" Griffin v. Illinois, supra, at 17. This
Court should, in my view, grant the petition for a writ of certiorari
to consider whether the California procedure for pleading not guilty
by reason of insanity is consonant with this "central aim" of our
Constitution. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the denial of
the petition.
