Present: Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice White, Justice Blackmun,
Justice O'Connor, Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, Justice Souter, and
Justice Thomas.
The Court convened at 10:00 a.m. in the West Conference Room and
the Chief Justice said:
"The Court will take a recess to attend the inauguration of the Presi-
dent of the United States."
The Court adjourned to the restored Supreme Court chamber at the
Capitol to robe. The oath of office was administered to Vice President
Gore by Justice White. The oath of office was administered to President
Clinton by the Chief Justice. The Marshal adjourned the Court until
Monday, January 25, 1993, at 10 o'clock.

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Present: Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice Blackmun, Justice O'Con-
nor, Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, Justice Souter, and Justice
Thomas.
The Chief Justice said:
"As we open this morning, I announce with sadness that our friend
and colleague Thurgood Marshall, a former Justice of this Court, died.
yesterday, January 24, 1993, at the National Naval Medical Center, Be-
thesda, Maryland.
Born in Baltimore, Maryland in 1908, Thurgood Marshall was the
grandson of a Union soldier, his namesake, and a great-grandson of a
slave. His father worked as a dining-car waiter and a chief steward at a
segregated club, and early instilled in his son the urge to question the
legal status of minorities in this country. His mother taught school for
over three decades and devoted herself to her two sons while they were
growing up. Justice Marshall worked his way through Lincoln Univer-
sity and excelled at Howard University Law School under the tutelage
of Charles Houston.
After a brief period in solo practice in Baltimore, Justice Marshall
joined the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, eventually be-
coming its special counsel and, later, its director. The most influential
civil rights lawyer of this century, Justice Marshall designed and imple-
mented the NAACP's legal strategy to eradicate racial discrimination
in education, transportation, housing, and the voting booth. In court-
houses across the country, he became the champion of equal opportu-
nity for minorities. As an advocate, Justice Marshall won 29 cases be-
fore this Court, including the landmark Brown v. Board of Education.
He left the NAACP when President Kennedy appointed him to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 1961. In 1965,
President Johnson named him Solicitor General and, two years later,
appointed him an Associate Justice of this Court.
Justice Marshall's contributions to constitutional law before his ap-
pointment to this Court were singular. These contributions alone would
entitle him to a prominent place in American history had he never
served on this Court. Building on those earlier accomplishments, he be-
came an important voice in shaping the decisional law during his
twenty-four years on the Supreme Court bench.
The members of this Court will miss Justice Marshall's wit, warmth
and charm, and I speak for them in expressing our profound sympathy

428
MONDAY, JANUARY 25, 1993
to Mrs. Marshall, her sons Thurgood and John, the remainder of the
Marshall family, and all those whose lives were touched by this extraor-
dinary man. The recess this Court takes today will be in his memory.
At an appropriate time, the traditional memorial observance of the
Court and the Bar of the Court will be held in this Courtroom."

MONDAY, JUNE 28, 1993

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Present: Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice White, Justice Blackmun,
Justice Stevens, Justice O'Connor, Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy,
Justice Souter, and Justice Thomas.
The Chief Justice said:
"As most of you know, our esteeemed colleague, Justice White, is re-
tiring from this bench and his colleagues have sent him this letter on
this occasion which I will now read."
"Dear Byron:
"Your decision to retire from the Court has brought to each of us a
profound sense of sadness. You came here more than thirty-one years
ago, and have played a pivotal part in the deliberations and decisions of
this institution with three different Chief Justices during the adminis-
tration of eight different Presidents.
-
"You brought to the Court a reputation for excellence in many
fields scholar-athlete, combat intelligence officer in the South Pacific
during World War II, successful private lawyer, Deputy Attorney Gen-
eral. Your long service here has greatly enhanced that reputation, as
you have exhibited a firm resolve not to be classified in any one doc-
trinal pigeonhole. The important opinions which you have authored for
the Court in virtually every field of law with which we deal will remain
as a testament to your years of service here.
"Every cloud, they say, has a silver lining; for us the silver lining to
your retirement is that you leave in good health, and plan to remain
here in the Washington area, at least for the time being. You will be
missed at our Conferences, but we will continue to enjoy your friend-
ship which means so much to each of us.
Antonin Scalia
Anthony M. Kennedy
David H. Souter
Clarence Thomas
Affectionately,
Justice White replied as follows:
"Dear Colleagues,
William H. Rehnquist
Harry A. Blackmun
John Paul Stevens
Sandra Day O'Connor"
"I am grateful for your very generous letter on the occasion of my
retirement, which is now upon me. There is no doubt that I shall miss
the Court very much, primarily because I shall no longer have the

894
MONDAY, JUNE 28, 1993
pleasure and excitement of working in a small group of nine Justices, all
of whom day after day and year after year are together dealing with the
same issues and cases in an attempt to arrive at satisfactory decisions. I
have sat with 20 Justices in my time here and have had great respect
for the ability and integrity of each of them. I have treasured their
friendship. Of course, Justices differ with one another on all sorts of is-
sues, but we have not held grudges and have gotten along remarkably
well. That is how it should be.
"This Court is a very small organization for the freight it carries, and
its work is made possible only by the competent and dedicated service
of those who work here. I shall always be grateful to all of them for
their willing, friendly and reliable help down through the years.
"Since I remain a federal judge and will likely sit on Courts of Ap-
peals from time to time, it will be necessary for me to follow the Court's
work. No longer will I be able to agree with or dissent from a Court's
opinion. Hence, like any other Court of Appeals judge, I hope the
Court's mandates will be clear, crisp, and leave those of us below with
as little room as possible for disagreement about their meaning.
"The Court is a great institution, and I wish it well. It has been good
to me.
Cheers,
Byron"
