SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES.
MONDAY, OCTOBER 14, 1907.
The court met pursuant to law.
Present: The Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Harlan, Mr. Justice White,
Mr. Justice Peckham, Mr. Justice McKenna, Mr. Justice Holmes,
Mr. Justice Day, and Mr. Justice Moody.
The Chief Justice said:
By immemorial usage, as the gentlemen of the bar are well aware,
the court does not enter upon general business on the first day of
the term. Motions noticed for the first day stand over to the second,
and on the latter day the call of the docket is commenced. The
court ordinarily adjourns at once in order to enable its members to
pay their respects, in a body, to the President of the United States.
It has sometimes happened that the President is absent, and in that
case the court takes matters that parties are prepared to submit; and
that is the situation now.
The usual order as to the call of the docket will be entered, and
applications not objected to as to the day will be entertained.
