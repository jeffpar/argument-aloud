Mr. Attorney-General Miller addressed the court as follows:
May it please the Court: On the 6th day of February last the bar of
this court adopted a memorial which I now have the honor to present:
"Resolved, That the members of the bar of the Supreme Court of the
United States desire to record their sense of the loss that has come to the
profession and to the nation in the death of Joseph P. Bradley, justice
of this court.
"He brought to the bench long experience, great energy, strong and
patriotic convictions, a scholarship as wide and varied as it was thorough
and exact, and an unyielding courage. He was at the same time one of
those rare characters in which vast learning is united with intense activity
and business capacity; a master of men as well as books, practical as well
as theoretical.
During his long service here he has more than done every duty, grow-
ing constantly in his work and in the regard of his fellows and of the
nation, until, in the fullness of age, rounded and softened by years of
judicial duty, gentle scholarship, and labor for the people, he has passed
away lamented by the bar, the bench, and the country that he served; a life
complete, with a large place in history among the creators and moulders
of our national jurisprudence.
Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be presented by the presi-
dent and secretary of this meeting to the family of Mr. Justice Bradley,
with the sincere sympathy of the profession in their bereavement, and
that the Attorney-General be requested to present to the Supreme Court
in session the proceedings of this meeting."

135
These occasions are recurring with painful frequency. In each of the
years 1887, 1888, 1889, 1890, and now again at the threshold of 1892,
an honored member of this court has been summoned into that presence
of inconceivable solemnity, where all must appear at last to answer for
duty done or duty neglected. Well may the bar and the court say they are
"becoming reluctant to grant these, their last highest honors." Yet
neither in length of days, nor in their results, is the end of the life of
Justice Bradley untimely. Having passed the limit prescribed by the
Psalmist, and “by reason of strength" attained almost fourscore years,
all the journey rich and useful in the fruits of his talents, his industry,
and his learning, "like the mildness, the serenity, the continuing benignity
of the summer's day he has gone down with slow, descending, grateful,
long-lingering light," the radiance of the evening giving sure promise of
a morning and a morrow of endless brightness.
The oldest of eleven children, of Puritan New England lineage, Joseph
P. Bradley was born on a farm in Albany County, New York, on the
14th day of March, 1813, and therefore, on January 22d last, the day of
his death, was near the end of his seventy-ninth year.
The means of his parents, who at his birth were only nineteen years old,
were slender, and the circumstances of his childhood and youth were very
hard. The little farm was rugged, almost mountainous, the soil thin
and barren. The meager crops were eked out by cutting wood from the
hillsides and burning it into charcoal, which young Bradley peddled
about the streets of Albany. But though sore pressed to supply the needs
of their fast-growing flock, this father and mother were of the intelligent
farmer class, so often ambitious to give their children a better chance than
their own, and they did for their boy the best they could. A few months'
country school in winter, and a few books, were the foundation on which a
great superstructure of learning was built, a foundation which, with all
due respect to so-called improved school systems and modern methods, it is
believed was all the better for the ambitious boy, because the opportuni-
ties were rare and the few books so entirely mastered. In the inter-
vals of necessary work we can imagine this boy, in garments homespun
and home-made, every thread and every stitch inwoven with the warmth
of a mother's love, slight of form but full of life and energy, quick of
motion and quick of temper, eager and apt in all the sports with his fel-
lows, but even more eager and more apt in the use of his slight opportu-
nities, by book or school, to feed the beginnings of that hunger of the mind
which was the spur of his whole life and which to the last was insatiable.
At sixteen this boy, with so few advantages, instead of a pupil became
the teacher of a winter school, an occupation continued for four seasons.
This was the best possible training, because it necessitated thoroughness.
As a pupil one may get along with superficial knowledge. Before one

136
can instruct, he must not merely know, but he must know how and why
and for what purpose; he must know not merely facts, but principles.
At twenty, entering the freshman class at Rutgers, with a very meagre
preparation in Greek and Latin, at the end of the year he had, nevertheless,
made such progress as to jump the sophomore and enter the junior class,
and was graduated two years later with the late Secretary Frelinghuysen,
Governor Newell, and Cortlandt Parker, all eminent in the law and in
public affairs.
Mr. Parker says that Bradley was facile princeps in his class, though
compelled to miss the last term of his course, in order, by teaching, to earn
money to pay his way.
Of many incidents of his student life, suggestive of his future character
and achievements, time forbids to speak. They all prophesied a man of
integrity, of industry, and of notable talents.
Young Bradley does not seem to have been strikingly precocious-was
not a genius like Grotius or Hamilton, striding at once to the front of his
profession. His first years at the bar, as with most young men, were a
struggle; his success and greatness were a growth, the result of days of
toil and nights of study. The unfolding of the law to him is admirably
described in his own language:
"As in the creation we may suppose that the light of the stars did not
all burst upon man at a single moment, but came upon him from their dis-
tant chambers in successive beams one after another, according to their
recondite stations in space, so in the study of the law one great principle
after another comes to the yearning mind and overspreads it with light and
gladness; and many long years may elapse before one can feel that he has
really mastered the law and fully obtained the 'gladsome light of juris-
prudence' spoken of by Lord Coke."
As a student and as a man a most striking trait of his character was
thoroughness. He studied almost everything, and whatever he studied
became his own, a part of his very self.
In concluding the address (already quoted from) delivered by him be-
fore the students of the law school of the University of Pennsylvania in
1884, an address worthy the pen of Blackstone, Justice Bradley pictured
the ideal lawyer as follows: "To sum up all in one word, in order to be
an accomplished lawyer it is necessary, besides having a knowledge of the
law, to be an accomplished man, graced with at least a general knowledge
of history, of science, of philosophy, of the useful arts, of the modes of
business, of everything, in fact, that concerns the well-being and inter-
course of men in society. He ought to be a man of large understanding;
he must be a man of large acquirements and rich in general information,
for he is a priest of the law, which is the bond and support of civil society,

137
and which extends to and regulates every relation of one man to another
in that society and every transaction that takes place in it. Trained in
such a profession and having these acquirements and two things more,
which can never be omitted from the category of qualifications—incor-
ruptible integrity and a high sense of honor-the true lawyer can not but
be the highest style of a man, fit for any position of trust, public or pri-
vate; one to whom the community can look up as a leader and guide;
fit to judge and to rule in the highest places of magistracy and government,
an honor to himself, an honor to his kind."
Studying his life and its results, one is impressed that this picture was
ever before him. By a long life of striving, probably more nearly than
any one of his time, he attained to that lofty ideal.
Of Sir Thomas More, the first layman commoner to become lord chan-
cellor, and who was wiser than his cotemporaries by at least three hun-
dred years, it is said that "he was perfecting himself in most of the lib-
eral sciences, as music, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and growing to
be a perfect historian." So of Judge Bradley. While the law was his
business and the great study of his life, many, perhaps I should say
most, other fields of knowledge were diligently cultivated, not only as rec-
reations, but as auxiliary to his profession. Mathematics, for which he
had a special fondness and aptitude, and which he pursued with delight
into its most abstruse applications, astronomy, theology, biblical criticism,
languages, literature, science, political economy, in short, he seemed to have
studied almost everything, and to have made a part of himself all that his
thought had touched. Yet wide and profound as were the general re-
searches of this great man, they were only subsidiary to his work in the
law. For thirty years he studied and practiced his profession in all its
branches with great diligence and great success.
William Pinkney is said to have declared that, in his time, only two
men at the bar of the United States had mastered Coke upon Littleton-
Chief-Justice Parsons and himself. Indeed, to acquire a thorough knowl-
edge of English and American jurisprudence, as administered in the courts
of law, chancery, and admiralty, is a life task, to be accomplished only by
large abilities under the spur of high ambition. Add to this a thorough
acquaintance with the jurisprudence of republican and imperial Rome,
with the Code Napoleon, and generally with the laws of continental
Europe, and we approximate the strictly professional resources of this
great lawyer and judge. Indeed, to speak the truth of this man's marvel-
ous learning is to invite the charge of exaggerated eulogy. Yet neither
in his writings nor in personal intercourse was there any display by Jus-
tice Bradley of his acquirements. One was impressed, not with what he
knew, but with what he was and what he did. All that he learned en-
larged the man; it did not merely add to the load of his possessions.

158
He was a modest man.
"Knowledge is proud that he has learned so much;
Wisdom is humble that he knows no more."
Nor was Justice Bradley simply a student, a man of learning. He was
a practical business man, a man of affairs-a man to be called upon where
large business interests were to be handled-a patriot, not only wise in
council, but capable, energetic, and efficient in action when the Govern-
ment was in peril, when troops were to be raised, transportation furnished,
and men, munitions, and supplies hurried to the front.
Prior to his appointment to this bench Mr. Bradley never held a pub-
lic office; yet no man was more active and influential, by word and deed,
on the side of whatsoever things were just and of good report in his city
and State.
His study of the law was not as something abstract, speculative, lifeless,
but in its relations to society-yea, as the very essence, the lifeblood of
civil society, even as the surgeon studies the life of his living subject. He
had not the gift of eloquence, as the term is generally understood in its
relation to juries; but he had what is vastly more important to a lawyer
and a judge, the power of clear, terse, vigorous statement, which, illuminat-
ing the subject under discussion, if it does not enlist the feelings, does con-
vince the understanding.
Politically his affinity was rather in the school of Hamilton than of
Jefferson. He believed that, in framing the Federal Constitution, the
fathers intended to create a nation, a sovereign among the sovereigns of
the earth; and, his judgment approving their work, he omitted no oppor-
tunity to assert and vindicate that sovereignty. Hence in his decisions
upon constitutional questions, whether arising out of economic or quasi po-
litical issues, the national idea always appears, even as the strand royal
in the woof of all the banners of Britain.
Of the quality and measure of his work as a justice of this court, running
through near sixty volumes of the reports, there is no need to speak. With
all his learning, with all his familiarity with reported decisions, Justice Brad-
ley's opinions rarely rest primarily on adjudged cases. They are bottomed
in principle, and then, when practicable, buttressed by authority. The
principle involved is clearly stated, with its necessary logical results, and
cases are cited to show that, on similar facts, like deductions have approved
themselves to other judges-been sanctioned by other courts. The con-
clusion is right, not because others have said so, but others with him have
said So, because it is right. Being what he was, the work of Justice
Bradley could not be less than what it is-worthy of the man, an honor
to the great court and the great country for which he spoke. His opin-
ions are their own eulogy, the best, the most enduring monument to the
fame of their author.

139
But let no jurist suppose that popular fame awaits him. Such honors
are for more showy service, for men on horseback, or for those in political
life who touch the people's heart-excite national enthusiasm. The laws
of society like the laws of nature work unseen and in silence. The prin-
ciple of gravitation, pervading and regulating the material universe, was
unnoted by men for near six thousand years. If the law herself, omni-
present and all-beneficent, excites so little interest, her priests, quietly
ministering in her temple, must be content with respect and veneration.
They may not hope for popular applause.
Justice Bradley was a Christian man, cherished the domestic virtues in
his home, was a good neighbor, and a good citizen. He tried always to
preserve a conscience void of offense toward God and man. Charges
against his integrity or honor fell away from him as hurtless as hail from
the face of yonder monument. To assert that such endowments, enriched
by such cultivation, have perished, that the light of such a life has sunk
in endless night, is to impeach the economy of nature.
Justice Bradley was a great lawyer, a great magistrate, a great man.
He exalted the tribunal wherein he sat; he enlarged the measure of the
place he occupied. His successor will in due time be appointed; his place
will not soon be filled.
The Chief Justice responded:
We receive the memorial of the bar and the address of the Attorney-
General as deserved tributes to the eminent man, whose labors have illu-
minated the conclusions of this tribunal, and whose gracious presence has
been to its members a source of inspiration and fraternal regard, for so
many years. We, indeed, sorrow deeply that we shall see his face no
more.
The story of the lives of those who have triumphed over adverse
circumstance and by indomitable will and industry attained that great-
ness in usefulness and in fame to which their mental gifts entitled them,
is always full of interest and instruction, and in pertraying the early diffi-
culties surmounted by our departed brother, the Attorney-General has
justly called attention to the impressive lesson taught, in that particular,
by his career, and indicated one of the most striking grounds of the success
with which that career was attended. For the capacity for unremitting
intellectual toil was his, accompanied by that power of concentration
wherein lies the secret of mastery.
He had not only the "inquiring" but the "intending" mind. He not
only looked into things, but threw himself upon them and possessed him-
self of them. In each instance, his nature seemed subdued to what it
worked in, "like the dyer's hand.” Minuteness and comprehensiveness
went together, so that to his understanding the illustration from the

140
Arabian Nights might well be applied, as it was to Bacon, that it resem-
bled the fairy's tent, which could be placed, perfect in its proportions, on
the hand, but set up upon the plain, whole armies could encamp beneath
its shade.
It would be unreasonable to say that he took "all knowledge for his
province," yet the range of his studies was vast; the books chewed and
digested, many; and his acquaintance with affairs so extensive, that what
was original and what acquired poured from him in a common flood.
If, as has been said, great judges may be divided into those who decide
the particular dispute correctly, and those who, in doing that, expound
the principles which will govern future cases, Mr. Justice Bradley unde-
niably belonged to the latter class; for his decisions in disposing of the
matter in hand so explained the reason and the philosophy of the rule ap-
plied, as to furnish a guide to the solution of problems to come.
Taking his seat upon this bench, conversant with every branch of the
law, and with a mind filled with the results of brooding over fundamental
principles in the vigils of many years, there is no ground for surprise
that he has left a lasting impress upon the jurisprudence of his country.
His opinions from the 9th Wallace to the 141st United States (num-
bering nearly five hundred), couched in pure, undefiled English, vigorous
but elegant, whether in the great domain of constitutional law, in cases at
law or in equity, in admiralty, in patent causes, covering the whole field
of judicial investigation, whether involving the application of the subtle
learning of the common law, or the refined and equitable distinctions of
the civil, whether treating of the principles of social order, of civil and
political liberty, the bases of forms of government or the immortal struc-
ture of his own, constitute a repository of statesmanlike views, and of
enlightened rules in the administration of justice, resting upon the eternal
principles of right and wrong, which will never pass into oblivion—an
edifice which will remain even though time erase from its corner stone the
name of the architect and builder. This is the exceeding great reward of
an illustrious magistrate, that his work in contributing to the progress
happiness of mankind by the just enforcement of the laws, will last as
long as humanity endures.
and
The President of the United States, in acknowledging the official noti-
fication of Mr. Justice Bradley's death, said: "He was not only learned
in the law, but the temper of his mind was so fine and his wisdom so
great that I do not wonder that you valued his counsels so highly."
This observation is discriminating and just, for it touches that reserved
force, termed character, which gave Mr. Justice Bradley an influence be-
yond the mere words he wrote or uttered. Fineness of mind, wisdom of
thought, cordiality of heart, simplicity of manner, conscientious devotion
to duty, an absolute integrity-these he had, and possessing these, he has

141
left no unfinished window in the palace of the reputation bequeathed to
posterity. Never suffering the talents given him to be weakened or ex-
tirpated by disuse, he perservered in the performance of public duty far
beyond the period assigned as entitling to well-earned repose.
And so beneath the quiet stars, that appeared in the heavens as the
twilight faded away, he continued to reap the harvest of a well-spent life,
and at the summons of his Master came, bringing his sheaves with him.
An adjournment has heretofore been had as a mark of respect to the
memory of our beloved associate, and a majority of our number has at-
tended the committal of his body in the sure and certain hope of the life
of the world to come. The resolutions and the remarks which have ac-
companied their presentation will be entered upon the record.

Ordered that all parts of Rule 67 of the Rules of Practice for the Courts
of Equity of the United States, as now existing, be, and the same are
hereby, superseded, and the following rule is promulgated as such Rule
67:
After the cause is at issue commissions to take testimony may be taken
out in vacation as well as in term, jointly by both parties or severally by
either party, upon interrogatories filed by the party taking out the same
in the clerk's office, ten days' notice thereof being given to the adverse
party to file cross-interrogatories before the issuing of the commission ;
and if no cross-interrogatories are filed at the expiration of the time, the
commission may issue ex parte. In all cases the commissioner or commis-
sioners may be named by the court or by a judge thereof, and the presid-
ing judge of the court exercising jurisdiction may, either in term time or
in vacation, vest in the clerk of the court general power to name commis-
sioners to take testimony.
Either party may give notice to the other that he desires the evidence
to be adduced in the cause to be taken orally, and thereupon all the wit-
nesses to be examined shall be examined before one of the examiners of
the court, or before an examiner to be specially appointed by the court.
The examiner, if he so request, shall be furnished with a copy of the
pleadings.
Such examination shall take place in the presence of the parties or their
agents, by their counsel or solicitors, and the witnesses shall be subject to
cross-examination and reëxamination, all of which shall be conducted as
near as may be in the mode now used in common-law courts.
The depositions taken upon such oral examination shall be reduced to
writing by the examiner, in the form of question put and answer given;
provided that, by consent of parties, the examiner may take down the
testimony of any witness in the form of narrative.
At the request of either party, with reasonable notice, the deposition of
any witness shall, under the direction of the examiner, be taken down

205
either by a skillful stenographer or by a skillful typewriter, as the ex-
aminer may elect, and when taken stenographically shall be put into type-
writing or other writing: Provided, That such stenographer or type-
writer has been appointed by the court, or is approved by both parties.
The testimony of each witness, after such reduction to writing, shall be
read over to him and signed by him in the presence of the examiner, and
of such of the parties or counsel as may attend; provided, that if the wit-
ness shall refuse to sign his deposition so taken, then the examiner shall
sign the same, stating upon the record the reasons, if any, assigned by the
witness for such refusal.
The examiner may, upon all examinations, state any special matters to
the court as he shall think fit; and any question or questions which may
be objected to shall be noted by the examiner upon the deposition, but he
shall not have power to decide on the competency, materiality, or relevancy
of the questions; and the court shall have power to deal with the costs of
incompetent, immaterial, or irrelevant depositions, or parts of them, as
may be just.
In case of refusal of witnesses to attend, to be sworn, or to answer any
question put by the examiner, or by counsel or solicitor, the same practice
shall be adopted as is now practiced with respect to witnesses to be produced
on examination before an examiner of said court on written interrogatories.
Notice shall be given by the respective counsel or solicitors to the oppo-
site counsel or solicitors, or parties, of the time and place of the examina-
tion, for such reasonable time as the examiner may fix by order in each
cause.
When the examination of witnesses before the examiner is concluded,
the original depositions, authenticated by the signature of the examiner,
shall be transmitted by him to the clerk of the court, to be there filed of
record, in the same mode as prescribed in section 865 of the Revised
Statutes.
Testimony may be taken on commission in the usual way, by written
interrogatories and cross-interrogatories, on motion to the court in term
time or to a judge in vacation, for special reasons, satisfactory to the court
or judge.
Where the evidence to be adduced in a cause is to be taken orally, as
before provided, the court may, on motion of either party, assign a time
within which the complainant shall take his evidence in support of the
bill, and a time thereafter within which the defendant shall take his evi-
dence in defense, and a time thereafter within which the complainant shall
take his evidence in reply; and no further evidence shall be taken in the
cause, unless by agreement of the parties, or by leave of court first obtained,
on motion for cause shown.

206
The expense of the taking down of depositions by a stenographer, and
of putting them into typewriting or other writing shall be paid in the
first instance by the party calling the witness, and shall be imposed by the
court as part of the costs upon such party as the court shall adjudge
should ultimately bear them.
The Chief Justice also announced that the court would adjourn for the
term on Monday, the 16th instant.
