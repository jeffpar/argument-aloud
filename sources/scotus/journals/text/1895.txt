SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES.

The court met pursuant to law.
Present: The Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Field, Mr. Justice Harlan,
Mr. Justice Gray, Mr. Justice Brewer, Mr. Justice Brown, Mr. Justice
Shiras, and Mr. Justice White.
The Chief Justice said:
The court reassembles again saddened by a vacant chair. Mr. Justice
Jackson died at Nashville, Tenn., on the 8th day of August last. This
was followed by the death of Mr. Justice Strong on the 19th day of the
same month, who, during his retirement, had maintained his companion-
ship with the members of the bench he had adorned.
It has been the immemorial usage for the court on the first day of the
term or first day upon which a quorum appeared-not to proceed in
the transaction of business, but to adjourn to wait upon the President of
the United States. The President is absent, and we shall follow the
course pursued last year, namely, to dispose of such matters as may be
properly brought before us. All motions not submitted to-day may be
brought on to-morrow, and the usual order for the call of the docket that
day will be entered.
The Hon. Richard Olney then addressed the court as follows:
I ask the indulgence of the court while I present my successor in the
office of Attorney-General of the United States-Mr. Judson Harmon.
The Chief Justice responded:
The court parts with the retiring Attorney-General with regret, and is
happy to welcome his successor. Let the commission of the Attorney-
General of the United States be recorded.

Mr. Attorney-General Harmon addressed the Court as follows:
It is with more than a sense of official propriety that I comply with
the request of the bar by presenting to the court their resolutions relat-
ing to the late Justice Jackson. We of his home circuit knew him best.
There were his birthplace and his home. There his first regular judicial
work was done, by which he made the reputation that led to the call
from across the party wall to a seat beside your honors.
The active bar always feel some misgivings when a man in public life,
even though he has won distinction there, is called to the bench, espe-
cially when he has reached middle age. But they soon found that Howell
Edmonds Jackson was not so much a senator who had been appointed
judge as a judge who had served for a time as senator. His mind, nat-
urally broad and strong, symmetrically developed, controlled by steady
purpose, and directed by industry which seemed almost weariless, would
have enabled him to fill with credit any place which requires such qual-
ities. He had so filled the high positions to which the resolutions refer,
but he was peculiarly fitted for the duties of a judge. He had in high
degree patience to hear and consider, and firmness to decide. He had an
even temper, judgment unprejudiced toward men or things, and a logical
turn of mind which naturally shed irrelevance and sophistry and inclined
to accuracy of fact and correctness of conclusion. He loved justice in
the concrete as well as in the abstract and felt the pleasure a strong judge
always takes in applying the principles of law to the redress of wrongs;
but he knew and loved the system of judicial science too well to wrench
or impair it, and unsettle the rights of the great body of the people, in

55
seeking to avoid those occasional hardships against which human law,
being necessarily general, can not provide. So his decisions were of
the kind which build and perfect our jurisprudence, and not a series of
mere arbitrary judgments. There are few among them which the legal
mind hesitates to adopt among the precedents which keep the law in
healthful life and growth.
He was never chargeable with the blunders of a careless man or the
vacillations of a weak one, but won respect even when he failed to con-
vince, because he reached his conclusions by the broad highways and not
by indirection or evasion.
Some have excelled him in extent of learning and others in mere
force of intellect, but few have equaled him in the comprehensive per-
ception and abiding sagacity which result from a harmony of powers.
His vigorous practical understanding was not to be bewildered by details,
confused by doubtful or conflicting precedents, nor misled by refinements
of reasoning. His decisions always bore the stamp of his own mind
and character.
Absorbed as he was in the exacting duties of the circuit, his health
was shaken before he realized it, but he never lost patience or resolution.
The vigor he showed as a member of this court in the number and prompt-
ness of his opinions, as well as by their lucid thoroughness, was in spite
of the dragging of disease. And one of the most striking instances of
the calm heroism of peace was the resumption of his place when the
public interest required it in the income tax case. However opinion,
legal and lay, was and may remain divided on the questions involved in
that case, there is, and will be, no divided judgment about the high quali-
ties shown by the opinion of Mr. Justice Jackson, which all feared would
be, and which was, his last. Though the effort required undoubtedly
hastened the end, no true friend or patriot can feel regret, because it has
put on imperishable record an example of devotion to public duty whose
worth can not be too highly esteemed.
The feeling of personal bereavement which prevails to a very unusual
extent among those who knew Justice Jackson seems to me the highest
tribute to his memory. There is no warmth in mere mental power or
acquirement, nor in the most careful correctness. These may kindle
admiration or envy, but not the affection which is the best tribute of
man to man. I do not mean the mere result of pleasant ways, but the
sturdy liking implied in the line-
"He makes no friends who never made a foe."
He had a kind and considerate nature, but it did not blind him to his
duty, nor swerve him from it; and he was free from that morbid excess
of virtue which makes some good men unjust to their friends.

56
Reputation and honors did not affect his quiet simplicity, nor add to
the unobtrusive dignity which needed no assertion.
The entire life of Justice Jackson illustrates the efficiency of stead-
fast devotion to duties which come without selfseeking and are met
with diligence, earnestness, and sincerity of mind and purpose. His
seven years as circuit judge gave him time to accomplish a most honorable
career. Few positions put capacity and character to so severe a test as
the office of judge of a court of first resort and general jurisdiction.
This applies with great fitness to the sixth circuit whose four States,
reaching from Lake Superior to the Appalachian Range, like a cross sec-
tion of the great Republic, present almost every variety of population,
business and laws. Such a judge must admit and exclude evidence, sift,
discern, and analyze facts, and apply legal principles generally, all with-
out the advantage of associates, sometimes with slight aid from counsel,
and often with little opportunity for study and reflection. Many of his
judgments are final, and few are open to complete review; but every act
and utterance undergo the impartial and unerring scrutiny of the bar
and the people.
The powers of this highest of all tribunals are too great to be com-
mitted to one man alone. Their exercise is placed beyond the reach and
above the need of review by the association of minds which stimulate,
aid, and correct each other. Who may fitly join in the deliberations
of such a court but those who have stood the highest tests which the
profession affords?
Justice Jackson's career as a member of this court was cut short by his
untimely death; but he served long enough to vindicate the fitness of
his selection and sharpen still further our sense of loss. Whoever shall
be called to take that vacant place will find it none the easier to fill because
it was last held by Justice Jackson.
The resolutions are as follows:
The committee appointed at a meeting of the bar of the Supreme
Court of the United States, held in the Supreme Court room at the city
of Washington, October 14, 1895, in memory of Mr. Justice Jackson,
to draft resolutions to be reported at an adjourned meeting, present for
consideration the following:
On August 8, 1895, Mr. Justice Howell Edmonds Jackson departed
this life at his home, near Nashville, Tennessee.
He was born at Paris, Tennessee, in 1832, obtained his academic educa-
tion in his native State, graduated at the University of Virginia, and took
the degree of bachelor of laws at the Cumberland University, in Ten-
nessee.

57
He practiced law at Jackson and Memphis before the civil war, and
at once displayed those qualities which gave promise of the high rank
which he subsequently attained in the profession.
He was an earnest believer in the doctrines of the Whig party, was
devoted to the Union, and opposed secession. After his native State
passed the ordinance of secession and was threatened with invasion, he,
like so many others who would have sacrificed their lives, if by this
they could have removed the cause of strife and assured a happy union,
adhered, with all of the ardor of his nature, to the side his people had
chosen in the conflict. The war suspended the activities of civil life, and
holding an office under the Confederate Government, which, while one of
great trust, left him much leisure, he devoted himself throughout the
war to the most laborious and systematic study of the law, thus acquiring
an accuracy and breadth of legal knowledge which made him so fully
equipped for all of the responsible duties which came to him.
After the close of the civil war he practiced law in Jackson and Mem-
phis, and achieved a reputation second to none of his competitors. His
practice was varied, embracing office work of the most delicate and respon-
sible character, and litigation in all of the State and Federal courts, and
while his services were justly prized as a counsellor and as a chancery and
supreme court lawyer, he was no less successful in the severest jury con-
tests, where he achieved great triumphs, not by the graces of oratory,
which he never cultivated, nor the meretriciousness of cunning advocacy,
which he scorned, but by candor and earnestness, which won the confi-
dence of the jury, and clear, forcible, and logical arguments, which con-
vinced them.
On account of his reputation as a man and lawyer, he was called to a
seat upon the court of referees of Tennessee, which was a provisional
supreme court created to assist the regular court to dispose of the vast
accumulation of cases occasioned by the civil war. He served on this
court with great credit until its term expired.
Though never having taken any active part in politics, he consented,
on account of his great interest in the question of the settlement of the
State debt of Tennessee, to become a candidate on the State Credit ticket
for the State senate.
Following the custom established by immemorial usage in Tennessee,
he met his opponent in joint debate and made the canvass with so much
ability and persuasiveness as to win his election in a heated contest, in
which he advocated high taxes, the most unwelcome cause that could be
championed.
This, though not suspected by him, was the initial point of his national
A deadlock in the selection of a United States Senator, for
career.

58
which position he was not a candidate, was suddenly solved by his polit-
ical opponents, who, moved by an estimate of his character like that
which, on a later occasion, caused the President to nominate him to the
Supreme bench, came to his support as soon as his friends put his name
before the legislature; and, cooperating with a majority of his own party,
elected him on the first ballot. The offices of United States Senator,
Circuit Judge, and Justice of the Supreme Court all came to him in
unbroken succession and without expectation or effort on his part.
His career in these honorable and responsible positions is too well
known to need recapitulation.
His performance of the labors of his office, even when the hand of
death rested heavily upon him, will always remain a pathetic and
inspiring picture in the memory of those who saw his heroic efforts.
He was profoundly religious, and an elder in the Presbyterian Church.
His manner was reserved, and yet no one found him difficult of
approach. He was frank and courageous in expressing his opinions of
men and measures, yet free from bitterness and personal invective. He
was serious in affairs, but in the company of friends was always jovial,
enlivening conversation with sprightly humor and pointed anecdote. He
felt and maintained the dignity of his office and yet with those ameni-
ties which in a judge invest the intercourse between bench and bar with
an atmosphere which is as wholesome as it is gracious.
He displayed exact learning, laborious investigation, unfaltering
courage, absolute impartiality, and broad patriotism; therefore, be it
Resolved, That the members of the bar of the Supreme Court of the
United States, profoundly impressed with the great loss sustained by
the profession and the nation in the untimely death of Mr. Justice
Jackson, desire to record their esteem for the qualities which distinguished
his short career on the Supreme Bench, and which gave such perfect
assurance that he was a worthy successor of those distinguished judges
who have administered, with such fidelity and ability, the greatest trust
ever confided by a nation.
Resolved, That we deeply sympathize with the bereaved family of Mr.
Justice Jackson and that a copy of these resolutions be presented to
them by the secretary of this meeting.
Resolved, That the Attorney-General be requested to present these
resolutions to the Supreme Court in session and request that they be
recorded.
The Chief Justice responded:
Mr. Justice Jackson took his seat as a member of this court on the 4th
of March, 1893, serving for the remainder of the current term, which

59
closed on the 15th of May; sat through the next term, the month of
March excepted; and heard argument in a few cases at October term, 1894.
Perhaps no greater eulogium can be passed on him than to say that,
brief as was the period during which he was permitted to be with us, he
impressed himself upon his colleagues and the country as possessed of
the highest attributes of the judicial officer, and left enduring evidence
of judicial eminence on the records of the court.
There was no eccentricity in his success. He came here with a mind
disciplined by years of experience in business and political activities, in
an extensive professional practice and in the discharge of judicial duties
and stored with knowledge of affairs as well as of books, knowledge
qualifying him to deal with questions promptly and with practical wis-
dom, rather than knowledge of things "remote from use, obscure and
subtle."
Patience in hearing; assiduity in examination; quickness in grasp;
clearness in thought; facility, simplicity, and directness in expression;
all these he had, and they enabled him to find the clew in records how-
ever lost in wandering mazes and make it plain for guidance to correct
results.
He profoundly realized that the administration of justice is the great
end of human society, and that upon the conscientious labors of those to
whom that administration is committed the protection of life and liberty
and property depends, and so the endeavor to do justice ran like a
golden thread through all his work. Added and superior to all other
grounds of praise, it could well be said of him, as an eminent English
judge said of himself, that there was one merit to which he could boldly
lay claim the determination to do what was right, whenever that could
be discovered.
Of the cordial relations between Mr. Justice Jackson and his brethren,
which his engaging qualities of mind and heart rendered of the closest, I
do not care to speak. We part with him with a keen sense of personal
bereavement as he takes his place in the goodly company of those who
have gone before, though still remaining with us one in the blood of
common traditions and common labors.
There is little in the performance of judicial duty to attract popular
attention or to win popular applause, but the influence of faithful service
such as his of labors so abundant-of a life shortened by effort in the
public interest, “cut, like the diamond, with its own dust"-can scarcely
be overestimated, and sooner or later will receive its meed of recognition.
The pathetic incident at the close of Mr. Justice Jackson's career,
referred to by the Attorney-General, was characteristic of the man.

60
Devotion to duty had marked his course throughout, and he found in its
inspiration the strength to overcome the weakness of the outward man,
as, weary and languid, he appeared in his seat for the last time in obedi-
ence to the demand of public exigency. The response to the roll call
under such circumstances gives complete assurance-though, indeed, it was
not needed that when, a few weeks later, he came to the passage of the
river, Good Conscience, to whom in his lifetime he had spoken to meet
him there, lent him his hand and so helped him over.
The resolutions and the remarks by which they have been accompanied
will be entered on our records, and the court will now adjourn to Monday
next.
Adjourned until Monday next at 12 o'clock.
The day call for Monday, December 2, will be as follows: Nos. 88,
86, 89, 91, 93 (and 52), 94, 95, 96, 97, and 98.
