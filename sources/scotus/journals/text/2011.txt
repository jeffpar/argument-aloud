(JOURNAL)                MONDAY, OCTOBER 3, 2011                      1
SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

   Present: Chief Justice Roberts, Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, Jus­
tice Thomas, Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, Justice Alito, Justice
Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan.
   The Chief Justice said:
   “I have the honor to announce, on behalf of the Court, that the Octo­
ber 2010 Term of the Supreme Court of the United States is now
closed, and the October 2011 Term is now convened.
   “Today’s orders of the Court have been duly entered and certiﬁed
and ﬁled with the Clerk.”
   “Before we hear the ﬁrst argument this morning, I would like to
note that our colleague, Justice Antonin Scalia, has completed a quarter
century of service as a member of this Court. Justice Scalia took his
judicial oath of ofﬁce on September 26, 1986, and he heard his ﬁrst oral
argument as a justice on the ﬁrst Monday of October 25 years ago, and
the place has not been the same since.
   “On behalf of the Court, I congratulate you Justice Scalia on your
distinguished service. We all look forward to sharing many more years
with you in our common calling.”

circumstances “the court shall enter its order afﬁrming the judgment
of the court from which the case was brought for review with the same
effect as upon afﬁrmance by an equally divided court.” The Chief Jus­
tice, Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, Justice Thomas, Justice Ginsburg,
