SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES.
May 28, 1906.
DEAR BROTHER BROWN: We can not allow your active participa-
tion in the work of the court to terminate with the adjournment of to-day
without the expression of our sincere regret.
You came here with high reputation, justly deserved by a dis-
tinguished career of many years as a district judge of the United States,
to which you have added in the fruits of over fifteen years of eminent
judicial labors in this place.
Of those who were on this bench when you took your seat, Bradley,
and Lamar, and Blatchford, and Field, and Gray have passed on, and
you have witnessed the coming and the going of Shiras and Jackson, one
of whom happily survives.
In a certain sense, what shadows we are, and what shadows we pursue,
but not in every sense; for what has been worthily accomplished will
still live and the memory of the just judge will not perish.
We assure you that those of us who have been longest with you, as
well as those of a briefer association, alike concur in that affectionate
regard and that deep respect which your amiable disposition and the
great assistance in the administration of justice which your experience,
learning, and ability have enabled you to render have inspired.
We hope that the light which has come to pass at the evening-time of

199
a well spent life may long shine upon you, and that our fraternal inter-
course may be continued for many years.
Very cordially, yours,
MELVILLE W. FULLER,
JOHN M. HARLAN,

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES,
WASHINGTON, D. C., May 28, 1906.
MY DEAR BRETHREN: I thank you for your graceful and generous
expressions of esteem. One of the most delightful experiences of my
life has been the cultivation of the friendly companionships of the last
fifteen years, which I would gladly continue, were it not that impaired
eyesight and the inertia which comes with three score and ten admonish
me that my duty to the country, to you, and to myself demands a relin-
quishment of the burden I have borne for thirty-one years, half of
which have been spent in your company. While my resignation neces-
sitates a severance of our official relations, I hope these relations may
continue socially so long as our lives are spared to us.
I rejoice that I am leaving the court at a time when it has never stood
higher in the estimation of the people, nor when more important cases
have been, and still are being, presented for its consideration. The
antagonisms, sometimes almost fierce, which were developed during the
earliest decades of its history, and at one time threatened to impair its
usefulness, are happily forgotten; and the now universal acquiescence
in its decisions, though sometimes reached by a bare majority of its
members, is a magnificent tribute to that respect for the law inherent in
the Anglo-Saxon race, and contains within itself the strongest assurance
of the stability of our institutions. The services rendered by the
Supreme Court in this connection have been of incalculable value.
Again thanking you for your kindly interest in my welfare, I remain,
with profound respect,
Most sincerely, yours,
HENRY B. BROWN.
Order: It is now here ordered by the court that all the cases on the
docket not decided and all the other business of the term not disposed of
be, and the same are hereby, continued until the next term.
Adjourned to the time and place appointed by law.
