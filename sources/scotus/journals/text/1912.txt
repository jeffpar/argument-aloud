The Chief Justice also announced the following orders of the court:
No. 571. James L. Bradford, appellant, v. The United States. Ap-
peal from the Court of Claims. Per curiam: We permit an applica-
tion for a rehearing to be filed solely for the purpose of correcting
an inadvertent form of expression used in the opinion which it seems
it is considered might convey a mistaken impression to the detriment
of the appellant. The opinion, in speaking of the conviction of
appellant, declared that it was for defrauding the Government of
land, while the fact was that the prosecution and conviction was for
a conspiracy to defraud the Government of land. The difference―
if there be difference between the two offenses could have had no
possible influence upon the reasoning stated in the opinion which
rendered it necessary to affirm the judgment. We think, however, a
precisely accurate statement of the subject matter to which the con-
viction related should go upon the record to counteract any semblance
of injustice which might otherwise arise. Rehearing denied.
No. 188. C. H. Rexford, petitioner, v. The Brunswick-Balke-Col-
lender Company. It is ordered by the court that the mandate here-
tofore issued in this cause be recalled, and that the decree entered

court.

vator Company. Motion to advance granted, and cause assigned for
