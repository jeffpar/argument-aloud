                             “RESOLUTION”
  “Justice Harry A. Blackmun often joked that he came to the Supreme
Court as ‘Old Number Three,’ having been the third nominee proposed
by President Richard M. Nixon for the fabled seat once held by Justices
Joseph Story, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., Benjamin Cardozo, and Felix
Frankfurter. At his confirmation hearings, he was asked by Senator
James O. Eastland, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
whether he thought judges ought to be required to take senior status
at the age of 70. He replied that he was concerned that “[a]n arbitrary
age limit can lead to some unfortunate consequences. I think of Mr.
Justice Holmes and many others who have performed great service for
the country after age 70. So much depends on the individual. I think
some of us are old at a younger age than others are.” 1
  “The Justice was prescient. When he left the seat 24 years later, he
was ‘Old Number Three’ in a different sense: the third oldest Justice
ever to serve on the Court. And much of his legacy is the product of
his years on the Court after he turned 70: his opinions for the Court
in Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U. S. 745 (1982), Garcia v. San Antonio
Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985), Daubert v. Mer-
rell Dow Pharmaceuticals, 509 U. S. 579 (1993), and J. E. B. v. Ala-
bama, 511 U. S. 127 (1994); his concurrences in Planned Parenthood v.
Casey, 505 U. S. 833 (1992), and Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577 (1992);
and his dissents in Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U. S. 186 (1986), Mc-
Cleskey v. Kemp, 481 U. S. 279 (1987), and Callins v. Collins, 510 U. S.
1141 (1994). If some men are old at a younger age than others, Justice
Blackmun remained young to an older age, retaining until he died the
intellectual curiosity, passion for hard work, and openness to new ideas
and people that had been the hallmarks of his life.
  “The future Justice was born in Nashville, Illinois, on November 12,
1908. His family soon moved to St. Paul, Minnesota, where his father
owned a grocery and hardware store in a blue-collar neighborhood. The
Justice’s early life, during which he experienced or observed economic,
social, and familial hardships, proved a source of empathy in recogniz-
ing that ‘[t]here is another world “out there,” ’ Beal v. Doe, 432 U. S.
438, 463 (1977) (Blackmun, J., dissenting), a world inhabited by the
poor, the powerless, and the oppressed, the ‘frightened and forlorn.’

(Blackmun, J., dissenting).
  “In 1925, one of his high school teachers, who recognized an intellec-
tual spark in her pupil, persuaded Blackmun to seek his fortunes in the

wider world, and he won a scholarship from the Minnesota Harvard
Club to Harvard College. But because the scholarship paid only his
tuition, the future Justice worked as a janitor and a milkman, painted
handball courts, ran a motor launch for the coach of the Harvard crew
team, and graded math papers to make ends meet. Despite this gruel-
ing schedule, he received his A.B. summa cum laude in mathematics
in 1929. Although he had long planned on going to medical school, he
decided instead to attend Harvard Law School. At the law school, his
future colleague William J. Brennan, Jr., was a class ahead of him, and
he counted his predecessor Felix Frankfurter among his professors.
During his final year at law school, his team won the prestigious Ames
Moot Court competition.
   “After graduation, Blackmun returned to Minnesota to clerk for
Judge John B. Sanborn of the United States Court of Appeals for the
Eighth Circuit. His year and a half with Judge Sanborn gave him a
model for his own career as an appellate judge, and also gave him
exposure to some of the problems that occupied his judicial career.
   “In 1934, having finished his clerkship, Blackmun joined the presti-
gious firm of Dorsey, Colman, Barker, Scott & Barber in Minneapolis.
Fortuitously, the new associate was assigned to the firm’s tax depart-
ment, where he soon found his niche and had his first brush with the
institution where he would spend more than a quarter century.
   “On October 14, 1935, this Court convened for the first time to hear
oral argument in the magnificent building where it now sits. The first
case on the docket was Douglas v. Willcuts, 296 U. S. 1 (1935). The
litigation involved the question whether income from a trust estab-
lished by a soon-to-be ex-husband in lieu of paying alimony was taxable
to the grantor rather than to the recipient. Down in the lower left-hand
corner of the taxpayer’s reply brief was the name of a new associate,
who had apparently joined the litigation team after the opening merits
brief had been filed. It was Harry Blackmun. Less than a month after
the argument—and on the day before the future Justice’s 27th birth-
day—Chief Justice Hughes delivered a unanimous opinion rejecting
the position taken by Blackmun’s client.
   “On Midsummer’s Day 1941, Blackmun married ‘Miss Clark,’ his be-
loved wife Dottie. They had three daughters: Nancy, Sally, and Susie.
Blackmun’s 16 years at the Dorsey firm ended when he was named the
first resident counsel of the famed Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minne-
sota. He remembered his time there as the happiest decade of his life.
Not only was he able to make connections between law and medicine
but he and Mrs. Blackmun also cemented friendships that were to last
for a lifetime.

   “In 1959, when Judge Sanborn decided to take senior status, he de-
cided that his former law clerk, Harry Blackmun, should succeed him.
He then wrote to Deputy Attorney General Lawrence E. Walsh, saying
‘I sincerely hope, as I know you do, that political considerations will
not offensively enter into the selection of a successor. If they should,
there might be no vacancy to fill.’ 2 According to Judge Richard S. Ar-
nold of the Eighth Circuit, ‘[t]he story is that Judge Sanborn really
meant this: “Appoint Harry Blackmun, or there will be no appointment
to make.” ’ 3 The hint worked, and President Eisenhower appointed
Blackmun to fill Judge Sanborn’s seat. Judge Blackmun took office on
November 4, 1959.
   “Judge Blackmun wrote over 200 signed opinions during his time on
the Eighth Circuit.4 In light of his experience in practice, it is hardly
surprising that over a quarter were tax-related; his taste for, and ex-
pertise in, intricate questions involving the Internal Revenue Code
were well known. But the opinion he later described as the one of
which he was proudest, Jackson v. Bishop, 404 F. 2d 571 (8th Cir. 1968),
reflected a very different side of the judge’s temperament. The case
harkened back to his time clerking for Judge Sanborn, when he brought
a petition from an inmate protesting cruel prison conditions to his
judge’s attention. ‘I know, Harry,’ Judge Sanborn said, ‘but we can’t do
anything about it.’ This time, Judge Blackmun could do something
about the problem: Jackson was one of the first appellate opinions to
hold prison practices unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment.
Jackson was a pioneering decision under the Eighth Amendment.
Three inmates challenged the Arkansas prison system’s essentially un-
regulated practice of whipping prisoners. In one of the first, if not the
first, appellate opinions applying the Eighth Amendment to state
prison conditions (rather than simply to the types of punishment for
crime), Judge Blackmun declared that the prisoners were entitled to
an injunction barring further use of corporal punishment. His scholarly
and measured opinion powerfully conveyed Judge Blackmun’s commit-
ment to the inherent dignity of all people:

    ‘[W]e glean a recognition of, and a reliance in part upon, attitudes of
contemporary society and comparative law. And the emphasis is on
man’s basic dignity, on civilized precepts, and on flexibility and im-
provement in standards of decency as society progresses and matures.
. . . [T]he limits of the Eighth Amendment’s proscription are not easily
or exactly defined, and we also have clear indications that the applica-
ble standards are flexible, that disproportion, both among punishments
and between punishment and crime, is a factor to be considered, and
that broad and idealistic concepts of dignity, civilized standards, hu-
manity, and decency are useful and usable,” Jackson, 404 F. 2d, at 579.
    “At the same time, although he was prepared for bold doctrinal inno-
vation when he saw support in the existing Supreme Court precedent,
Judge Blackmun understood the constrained role of court of appeals
judges. At the 1968 investiture of his colleague, Judge Myron H.
Bright, Judge Blackmun reflected:
    ‘The concern [of a judge] is with what is proper law and with what is
the proper result for each case. . . . There’s always some uncertainty in
the law and for you, . . . there will be periods of uncertainty in your work.
There will be moments of struggle in trying to ascertain the correct from
the incorrect. . . . There will be the awareness of the awfulness of judicial
power, and although you will be on a multiple-judge court, you will expe-
rience the loneliness of decision. And there will be the embarrassment
which occasionally comes when you have to conclude that a fine District
Judge just might be wrong in his decision, and there will be the greater
embarrassment which inevitably comes when the Supreme Court con-
cludes that after all the District Judge was right and we were wrong. . . .
And there will be the realization that an individual Circuit Judge is not
important after all, that he is lost in the library, and that it does take two,
not one, to make a decision. Judge Sanborn, John B., reminded me, not
once but many times, that a United States Circuit Judge is just about as
unimportant as an honorary pallbearer. . . . But there also will be—and
I say this genuinely and seriously—the inner satisfaction and the inner
reward which one possesses in being permitted to work on matters of
real substance, in feeling that one’s decision, at least in his own con-
science, is right, and in knowing that hard work and hard thought and
practical and positive scholarship are about all and about the best that
anyone can offer. I’m certain that no part of the legal field is capable of
providing any higher sense of satisfaction in its work and in its spirit
than is the federal bench.’ 5

   “This combination of humility and insight is illustrated by Jones v.
Alfred H. Mayer Co., 379 F. 2d 33 (8th Cir. 1967), which was later
reversed by this Court. 392 U. S. 409 (1968). The case concerned the
question whether 42 U. S. C. § 1982 outlawed private racial discrimina-
tion in the sale of real property. The existing Supreme Court prece-
dent, Judge Blackmun felt, barred using Section 1982 to reach purely
private conduct: ‘It is not for our court, as an inferior one, to give full
expression to any personal inclination any of us might have and to take
the lead in expanding constitutional precepts when we are faced with
a limiting Supreme Court decision which, so far as we are told directly,
remains good law.’ 379 F. 2d at 43. Nonetheless, Judge Blackmun essen-
tially invited the Supreme Court to revisit the question—‘It would not
be too surprising if the Supreme Court one day were to hold that a
court errs when it dismisses a complaint of this kind,’ id., at 44—and
he laid out the different analyses that might support such a result.
Finally, Judge Blackmun expressed a desire for political solutions to
pressing social problems:
   ‘Relief for the plaintiffs lies, we think, in fair housing legislation
which will be tempered by the policy and exemption considerations
which enter into thoughtfully considered statutes. Recent cases indi-
cate that, if properly drawn, such legislation would encounter little
constitutional objection. The power exists but its exercise is absent.
The matter, thus, is one of policy, to be implemented in the customary
manner by appropriate statutes directed to the need. If we are wrong
in this conclusion, the Supreme Court will tell us so and in so doing
surely will categorize and limit those of its prior decisions, cited herein,
which we feel are restrictive upon us.’ Id., at 45 (citations omitted).
   “The meticulousness and modesty of Judge Blackmun’s approach to
difficult questions made him an appealing prospect for elevation to the
Supreme Court when President Richard M. Nixon’s first two attempts
to fill the seat left vacant by Justice Abe Fortas’s resignation failed in
the Senate.
   “The most striking thing about the future Justice’s confirmation
hearings—which lasted only one day and at which he was the only
witness—was the virtual absence of pointed consideration of any of the
issues with which he would become most closely identified during his
time on the Court, save for a few questions about whether he could
apply the death penalty given his personal opposition.
   “Nonetheless, the reported comments presaged some significant
characteristics of Justice Blackmun’s approach to his work. The Report
of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which unanimously recommended

                            WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 27, 1999             247
his confirmation, described him as a ‘man of learning and humility.’ 6
And the letter from the American Bar Association’s Standing Commit-
tee on the Federal Judiciary, which also unanimously endorsed Black-
mun’s nomination, described him as ‘one who conscientiously and with
open mind weighs every reasonable argument with careful knowledge
of the record, the arguments and the law.’ 7 It also reported the com-
ments of a district court judge from the Eighth Circuit that Blackmun
was ‘a gifted, scholarly judge who has an unusual capacity for the pro-
duction of opinions . . . which present learned treatises of the factual
and legal questions involved. And coupled with all of his erudition, he
is unassuming, kind and considerate in all of his associations with the
Bar and the public.’ 8 The Senate unanimously confirmed the nomina-
tion on May 12, 1970, and Justice Blackmun took the oath of office on
June 9, 1970.
   “Justice Blackmun served on this Court for 24 years. Perhaps more
than any other Justice in modern times, he became identified in the
popular mind with a single decision: his opinion for the Court in Roe
v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973). In Roe, this Court held that the due
process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects, under certain
circumstances, a woman’s decision whether to carry a pregnancy to
term. Throughout his service on the Court, the Justice vigorously de-
fended the principles laid out in Roe. His last opinion for the Court in
an abortion case, Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians
and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747, 772 (1986) (citations omitted), offered
a particularly eloquent expression of this commitment to individual
freedom:
   ‘Our cases long have recognized that the Constitution embodies a
promise that a certain private sphere of individual liberty will be kept
largely beyond the reach of government. That promise extends to
women as well as to men. Few decisions are more personal and inti-
mate, more properly private, or more basic to individual dignity and
autonomy, than a woman’s decision—with the guidance of her physician
and within the limits specified in Roe—whether to end her pregnancy.
A woman’s right to make that choice freely is fundamental. Any other
result, in our view, would protect inadequately a central part of the
sphere of liberty that our law guarantees equally to all.’
   “Justice Blackmun and his family paid a heavy price for his commit-
ment to a constitutionally protected zone of privacy for others: he was
the subject of fierce protests, hate mail, repeated picketing, death

threats, and a bullet fired through his living room window into a chair
in which his wife had recently been sitting.
   “The Justice often referred to Roe as a landmark in the emancipation
of women. This view was borne out by the joint opinion of three of his
colleagues who joined the Court after Roe, Justices O’Connor, Ken-
nedy, and Souter, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 856
(1992) (citation omitted):
   ‘[F]or two decades of economic and social developments, people have
organized intimate relationships and made choices that define their
views of themselves and their places in society, in reliance on the avail-
ability of abortion in the event that contraception should fail. The abil-
ity of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of
the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their repro-
ductive lives. The Constitution serves human values, and while the
effect of reliance on Roe cannot be exactly measured, neither can the
certain cost of overruling Roe for people who have ordered their think-
ing and living around that case be dismissed.’
   “Near the beginning of his opinion for the Court in Roe, Justice
Blackmun quoted Justice Holmes’ statement that the Constitution ‘is
made for people of fundamentally differing views,’ 410 U. S. at 117
(quoting Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45, 76 (1905) (Holmes, J., dis-
senting)). That imaginative empathy informed far more than the Jus-
tice’s abortion jurisprudence. In his dissent in Bowers v. Hardwick,
478 U. S. 186 (1986), for example, the Justice argued that the liberty
guaranteed by the due process clause protected the intimate decisions
of gays and lesbians:
   ‘The fact that individuals define themselves in a significant way
through their intimate sexual relationships with others suggests, in a
Nation as diverse as ours, that there may be many “right” ways of
conducting those relationships, and that much of the richness of a rela-
tionship will come from the freedom an individual has to choose the
form and nature of these intensely personal bonds. . . . [A] necessary
corollary of giving individuals freedom to choose how to conduct their
lives is acceptance of the fact that different individuals will make dif-
ferent choices.’ Id., at 205–206 (citation omitted; emphasis in original).
He ended the dissent by maintaining that ‘depriving individuals of
the right to choose for themselves how to conduct their intimate rela-
tionships poses a far greater threat to the values most deeply rooted
in our Nation’s history than tolerance of nonconformity could ever do,’

id., at 214, echoing a point he had made once in paraphrasing Pogo:
“We have met the enemy and he is us,” he is us.’ 9
   “This recognition that the true measure of the Constitution lies ‘in
the way we treat those who are not exactly like us, in the way we treat
those who do not behave as we do, in the way we treat each other,’ 10
was a hallmark of the Justice’s thinking. In the Justice’s first Term on
the Court, he wrote the Court’s pathbreaking opinion in Graham v.
Richardson, 403 U. S. 365 (1971). The case involved challenges to sev-
eral state welfare programs that either excluded aliens altogether or
severely restricted their eligibility for benefits. Justice Blackmun saw
that aliens presented ‘a prime example of a discrete and insular minor-
ity for whom . . . heightened judicial solicitude is appropriate.’ 403 U. S.
at 372 (quoting United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U. S. 144,
152–153, n. 4 (1938)). The Justice’s opinion for the Court was the first
to invoke the now-famous and influential, but then obscure, ‘footnote
four’ from Carolene Products to explain the reason for heightened judi-
cial scrutiny of discrete and insular groups. But just as significant as
the Justice’s recognition of aliens’ need for judicial protection was his
celebration of the special contributions aliens can make to American
life: they represent ‘some of the diverse elements that are available,
competent, and contributory to the richness of our society.’ Ambach v.
Norwick, 441 U. S. 68, 88 (1979) (Blackmun, J. dissenting).
   “Similarly, the Justice’s many opinions regarding the rights of Native
Americans illustrate his view that judgment requires both knowledge
and empathy. Perhaps in no other area did the Justice’s long-standing
interest in American history intersect so completely with his judicial
approach. The Justice’s opinion for the Court in United States v. Sioux
Nation of Indians, 448 U. S. 371 (1980), for example, set out in scrupu-
lous detail how the Sioux had been stripped of the Black Hills of South
Dakota and of their way of life. Strictly speaking, the detail might have
been unnecessary to resolving the technical issues of congressional in-
tent, Court of Claims jurisdiction, and principles of claim and issue
preclusion that determined the outcome of the case. But it was critical
nonetheless to the Justice’s central mission: grounding the judgment
for the Sioux in the ‘moral debt’ arising out of the dependence to which
the United States had reduced a proud and self-reliant people. Id., at
397.

   “This sense of promises betrayed was even more pointed in the ele-
giac tone of the Justice’s dissent in South Carolina v. Catawba Indian
Tribe, Inc., 476 U. S. 498 (1986), which rested on the premise that statu-
tory ambiguities should be resolved in favor of Native Americans’
claims because of ‘an altogether proper reluctance by the judiciary to
assume that Congress has chosen further to disadvantage a people
whom our Nation long ago reduced to a state of dependency.’ Id., at
520 (Blackmun, J., dissenting). The Justice argued that interpretation
of the statute should take into account how ‘the Indians would have
understood’ it. Id., at 527 (emphasis added). By moving from the ab-
stract principle to the concrete inclusion of the Catawbas’ perspective,
Justice Blackmun moved from a sympathetic to an empathetic view-
point. As Judge Richard Arnold has remarked, ‘the Justice’s writing
reflects “a struggle to put oneself in other people’s shoes.” ’ 11
   “The Justice’s concern with prison conditions continued along the
path on which he first set out as a law clerk and then as a judge on the
court of appeals in Jackson v. Bishop. In his last Term on the Court,
the Justice summed up his approach in his concurrence in Farmer v.
Brennan, 511 U. S. 825 (1994):
   ‘Although formally sentenced to a term of incarceration, many in-
mates discover that their punishment . . . degenerates into a reign of
terror unmitigated by the protection supposedly afforded by prison
officials.
   ‘The fact that our prisons are badly overcrowded and understaffed
may well explain many of the shortcomings of our penal systems. But
our Constitution sets minimal standards governing the administration
of punishment in this country, and thus it is no answer to the com-
plaints of the brutalized inmate that the resources are unavailable to
protect him from what, in reality, is nothing less than torture. I stated
in dissent in United States v. Bailey: “It is society’s responsibility to
protect the life and health of its prisoners. [W]hen a sheriff or a mar-
shal [sic] takes a man from the courthouse in a prison van and trans-
ports him to confinement for two or three or ten years, this is our act.
We have tolled the bell for him. And whether we like it or not, we have
made him our collective responsibility. We are free to do something
about him; he is not.” ’ Id., at 853–854 (Blackmun, J., concurring) (cita-
tions omitted; emphasis in original).
   “The Justice’s jurisprudential sense of connection with and responsi-
bility towards prisoners was accompanied, as was so characteristic of
him, by a personal sense of connection as well. He regularly received,

and read, a prison newspaper—the Stillwater (Minn.) Prison Mirror.
Indeed, the Justice traveled to Minnesota to present an award to Rob-
ert Morgan, the inmate-editor of the Mirror. And the Justice also in-
cluded prison administrators and officials in the Justice and Society
seminar he and Norval Morris led for nearly twenty summers at the
Aspen Institute. He hoped both that these officials would educate the
other participants about the concerns of the world inside the walls and
that the seminar would press them to think critically about their work
and its relationship to broad issues of justice and decency.
   “Finally, the Justice was a pioneer in thinking about the constitu-
tional rights of the mentally ill and mentally disabled. In Jackson v.
Indiana, 406 U. S. 715, 738 (1972), his opinion for the Court advanced
the proposition that ‘[a]t the least, due process requires that the nature
and duration of [an involuntary] commitment [to a mental institution]
bear some reasonable relation to the purpose for which the individual
is committed.’ He elaborated on this theme in his concurrence in
Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U. S. 307, 326 (1982):
   ‘If a state court orders a mentally retarded person committed for
“care and treatment,” however, I believe that due process might well
bind the State to ensure that the conditions of his commitment bear
some reasonable relation to each of those goals. In such a case, commit-
ment without any “treatment” whatsoever would not bear a reasonable
relation to the purposes of the person’s confinement.’
   “Thus, if a mentally disabled person lost his minimal self-care skills
because of the State’s failure to provide him with training, he might
suffer ‘a loss of liberty quite distinct from—and as serious as—the loss
of safety and freedom from unreasonable restraints. For many mentally
retarded people, the difference between the capacity to do things for
themselves within an institution and total dependence on the institu-
tion for all of their needs is as much liberty as they ever will know.’
Id., at 327.
   “One of the Justice’s most widely quoted images evoked the presence
of ‘another world out there,’ that an overly comfortable Court might
either ‘ignore or fea[r] to recognize.’ Ohio v. Akron Center for Repro-
ductive Health, 497 U. S. 502, 541–542 (1990) (Blackmun, J., dissenting);
Harris v. McRae, 448 U. S. 297, 346 (1980) (Blackmun, J. dissenting);
Beal v. Doe, 432 U. S. 438, 463 (1977) (Blackmun, J., dissenting). While
he used this precise phrase only in his dissents in abortion rights cases,
it reflected a broader commitment to learning about, and facing, facts
in the world. For example, in his separate opinion in Regents of the
Univ. of California v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265, 407 (1978), the Justice
expressed his support for race-conscious affirmative action in higher
education with these words: ‘The sooner we get down the road toward
JNL99$1027—02-24-01 19:40:18      JOURNAPGT           MILES




252                     WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 27, 1999

accepting and being a part of the real world, and not shutting it out
and away from us, the sooner will these difficulties vanish from the
scene.’ Similarly, in his dissent in City of Richmond v. J. A. Croson
Co., 488 U. S. 469 (1989), the Justice chided the Court for ignoring the
historical context in which the city’s affirmative action plan had been
developed:
   ‘I never thought that I would live to see the day when the city of
Richmond, Virginia, the cradle of the Old Confederacy, sought on its
own, within a narrow confine, to lessen the stark impact of persistent
discrimination. But Richmond, to its great credit, acted. Yet this Court,
the supposed bastion of equality, strikes down Richmond’s efforts as
though discrimination had never existed or was not demonstrated in
this particular litigation. . . . History is irrefutable. . . . So the Court
today regresses. I am confident, however, that, given time, it one day
again will do its best to fulfill the great promises of the Constitution’s
Preamble and of the guarantees embodied in the Bill of Rights—a ful-
fillment that would make this Nation very special.’ 488 U. S. at 561–562
(1989) (Blackmun, J., dissenting).
   “This understanding of the Constitution as a living document was
also powerfully expressed in the Justice’s dissent in Lassiter v. Depart-
ment of Social Services, 452 U. S. 18, 58–59 (1981), where the Justice
argued that the Due Process Clause required the state to provide coun-
sel to indigent parents before terminating their parental rights:
   ‘Ours, supposedly, is “a maturing society,” Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S.
86, 101 (1958) (plurality opinion), and our notion of due process is, “per-
haps, the least frozen concept of our law.” Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U. S.
12, 20 (1956) (opinion concurring in judgment). If the Court in Boddie
v. Connecticut, 401 U. S. 371 (1971), was able to perceive as constitu-
tionally necessary the access to judicial resources required to dissolve
a marriage at the behest of private parties, surely it should perceive
as similarly necessary the requested access to legal resources when the
State itself seeks to dissolve the intimate and personal family bonds
between parent and child. It will not open the “floodgates” that, I sus-
pect, the Court fears. On the contrary, we cannot constitutionally afford
the closure that the result in this sad case imposes upon us all.’
   “The Justice had a special wisdom and sensitivity about the relation-
ship among history, race, and gender. He knew when the law ought to
take account of race or gender: consider his often-quoted statement in
Bakke, that ‘[i]n order to get beyond racism, we must first take account
of race. There is no other way. And in order to treat some persons
equally, we must treat them differently. We cannot—we dare not—let
the Equal Protection Clause perpetuate racial supremacy.’ 438 U. S., at

407 (separate opinion of Blackmun, J.). But he also knew when the
continued use of race or gender would serve only ‘to ratify and perpet-
uate invidious, archaic, and overbroad stereotypes about the relative
abilities of men and women.’ J. E. B. v. Alabama, 511 U. S. 127, 131
(1994).
   “In a related vein, it was the Justice’s exposure to the actual opera-
tion of the capital punishment system that prompted his conclusion,
expressed in his dissent in Callins v. Collins, 510 U. S. 1141 (1994), that
‘[e]xperience has taught us that the constitutional goal of eliminating
arbitrariness and discrimination from the administration of death . . .
can never be achieved without compromising an equally essential com-
ponent of fundamental fairness—individualized sentencing.’ Id., at
1144:
   ‘From this day forward, I no longer shall tinker with the machinery
of death. For more than 20 years I have endeavored—indeed, I have
struggled—along with a majority of this Court, to develop procedural
and substantive rules that would lend more than the mere appearance
of fairness to the death penalty endeavor. Rather than continue to cod-
dle the Court’s delusion that the desired level of fairness has been
achieved and the need for regulation eviscerated, I feel morally and
intellectually obligated simply to concede that the death penalty exper-
iment has failed. It is virtually self-evident to me now that no combina-
tion of procedural rules or substantive regulations ever can save the
death penalty from its inherent constitutional deficiencies. The basic
question—does the system accurately and consistently determine
which defendants “deserve” to die?—cannot be answered in the af-
firmative. . . . The problem is that the inevitability of factual, legal, and
moral error gives us a system that we know must wrongly kill some
defendants, a system that fails to deliver the fair, consistent, and reli-
able sentences of death required by the Constitution.’ Id., at 1145–1146.
   “On a more abstract level, the Justice’s commitment to learning
about and facing the facts was expressed by his widely praised and
influential opinion for the Court in Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharma-
ceuticals, Inc., 509 U. S. 579 (1993). In Daubert, the Justice addressed
one of the central issues in contemporary litigation: the standard of
admissibility for expert testimony. Federal Rule of Evidence 702 pro-
vides that ‘[i]f scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will
assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a
fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert . . . may testify
thereto. . . .’ The Justice interpreted this rule to require that the con-
tent of the expert’s testimony be ‘scientific’ in the sense that it be
‘ground[ed] in the methods and procedures of science,’ 509 U. S. at 590,
JNL99$1027—02-24-01 19:40:18        JOURNAPGT            MILES




254                      WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 27, 1999

and that it concern ‘knowledge,’ not merely ‘subjective belief or unsup-
ported speculation,’ ibid. The Justice understood that science is a
method or a procedure rather than simply a body of facts. Daubert’s
discussion of the factors that make knowledge ‘scientific’—falsifiability,
peer review, error rates, and general acceptance within the relevant
scientific community, id., at 592–594—reflected the Justice’s longstand-
ing comfort with and receptivity to scientific and social scientific ways
of understanding complex events. Other examples of his approach in-
clude Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U. S. 880, 920–929 (1983) (Blackmun, J.,
dissenting) (discussing the validity of predictions regarding future dan-
gerousness); Ballew v. Georgia, 435 U. S. 223, 230–239 (1978) (opinion
of Blackmun, J.) (discussing studies of jury size); and Castaneda v. Par-
tida, 430 U. S. 482, 496–497, and n. 17 (1977) (discussing models of sta-
tistical probability and standard deviations).
   “No account of the Justice’s time on the Supreme Court would be
complete without a discussion of his tax opinions. Many observers, in-
cluding the Justice himself, remarked on the large number of tax cases
he was assigned. The Justice sometimes joked that these opinions were
the result of his being ‘in the doghouse with the Chief,’ but in fact he
retained both an interest and an expertise in taxation throughout his
judicial tenure.
   “One recent study concluded that during his time on the Court Jus-
tice Blackmun wrote majority opinions in 33 federal tax cases and con-
curring or dissenting opinions in an additional 26 federal tax cases.12
The Justice also wrote many significant opinions in cases involving
state taxation schemes, the commerce clause, and the due process
clause.13 As Robert Green, one of the Justice’s former clerks and a
prominent tax scholar has noted, ‘[m]any of Justice Blackmun’s tax
opinions are legendary among tax lawyers and academics. It is no coin-
cidence that law school casebooks in federal income taxation typically
include more cases written by Justice Blackmun than by any other
Supreme Court Justice.’ 14 For example, the Justice wrote a series of
influential opinions on the Internal Revenue Code’s treatment of capi-
tal expenditures and its connection to the matching principle: Commis-
sioner v. Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, 403 U. S. 345 (1971);
Commissioner v. Idaho Power Co., 418 U. S. 1 (1974); Thor Power Tool

States, 507 U. S. 546 (1993).
   “His opinions reflected a pragmatic, yet economically sophisticated,
approach to the issue and drew on a broad range of sources: the text of
the Code provisions involved and their legislative history, the broader
legislative purpose of the Code, post-enactment developments, includ-
ing the Internal Revenue Service’s interpretations, and the practical
effects different decisions would have. They employed a perceptive
‘tax logic,’ which interpreted the Internal Revenue Code in a sensible
and coherent way. As with so many areas of the Justice’s jurisprudence,
his approach to tax law was beautifully summarized in the eulogy de-
livered at his memorial service by his former minister, the Reverend
William Holmes:
   ‘Harry Blackmun excelled at math, and he knew the difference be-
tween mathematics and the law. What he brought to both the law and
Scripture was neither an absolute subjectivism nor an absolute relativ-
ism, but creative fidelity marked by humility, with a twinkle in his eye.’
   That twinkle in the Justice’s eye occasionally made its way into the
pages of the United States Reports. For example, in his opinion for the
Court in Flood v. Kuhn, 407 U. S. 258, 260–264 (1972), the Justice took
his readers for a tour through his beloved game of baseball, complete
with a list of notable players—he apparently forgot to include Mel Ott,
for which his clerks repeatedly teased him. But the twinkle was espe-
cially familiar to the many people whose lives he touched personally:
his colleagues on the Eighth Circuit, whom he delighted with his an-
nual appearance at the Circuit Conference; his law clerks, who became
members of his family and whose professional lives were changed for-
ever by their year with the Justice; the police officers, staff in the
clerk’s office, and other Court personnel, whom he treated with an af-
fection and respect they returned twofold; his secretaries and messen-
gers, who became close professional and personal companions; and,
most of all, his family—his wife Dottie, his daughters Nancy, Sally, and
Susie, and his grandchildren.
   “Justice Blackmun had a deep and abiding passion for American his-
tory. Above his desk, he kept a copy of a statement by his hero, Abra-
ham Lincoln:
   ‘If I were to try to read, much less answer, all the attacks made on
me, this shop might as well be closed for any other business. I do the
very best I know how—the very best I can; and I mean to keep doing
so until the end. If the end brings me out all right, what is said against

me won’t amount to anything. If the end brings me out wrong, ten
angels swearing I was right would make no difference.’
   “Through his commitment to a living Constitution and to careful
interpretation of the law, Justice Blackmun gave voice to what Lincoln
called, in his First Inaugural Address, ‘the better angels of our nature.’
We will miss him.
   “Wherefore, it is accordingly
   “RESOLVED that we, the Bar of the Supreme Court of the United
States, express our admiration and respect for Justice Harry A. Black-
mun, our sadness at his death, and our condolences to his family; and
it is further
   “RESOLVED that the Solicitor General be asked to present these

   “Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:
   “The Bar of the Court met today to honor the memory of Harry A.
Blackmun, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court from 1970 to 1994.
Justice Blackmun was best known for this opinion for the Court in Roe
v. Wade. Throughout his tenure, Justice Blackmun continued to write
frequently, both for the Court and in dissent, reaffirming his belief in
the correctness and the importance of the Roe decision. As the Solicitor
General’s description of the Bar resolution reminds us, Justice Black-
mun also made significant contributions to the law in a variety of other
areas, in fields as diverse as Indian law and tax law.

                       WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 27, 1999                   257
   “Justice Blackmun’s tenure on the Court reflected his strong, mid-
western work ethic. It can be traced to the values he developed during
his childhood in Minnesota. Indeed, that work ethic characterized his
entire academic and professional career.
   “During his early years of law practice, Justice Blackmun met and
married his beloved wife, Dottie, with whom he spent the remainder
of his life. They had three daughters, Nancy, Sally, and Susie, whose
success in school, careers, and families no doubt served as early sup-
port for the Justice’s commitment to equality of opportunity for women.
That commitment was reflected in many of his opinions for this Court
involving, for example, sex discrimination in employment, state law
limitations on child support recipients, jury selection, eligibility for
AFDC benefits and, of course, the regulation of abortion at issue in
Roe v. Wade.
   “The Roe v. Wade decision also reflected Justice Blackmun’s belief
that the Constitution protects a range of intimate and personal choices
from intrusion by the state. That belief was at the core of his dissenting
opinion in Bowers v. Hardwick, in which the Justice argued that the
Constitution affords protection of a right to engage in consensual
homosexual activity. Justice Blackmun’s jurisprudence often reflected
a distrust of abstractions and absolutes. That judicial attitude took var-
ious forms. Perhaps most importantly, it was manifested in his careful
attention to the facts and the records of individual cases and in a con-
viction that the Supreme Court was obligated to resolve fairly the
claims of particular litigants rather than simply announce broad legal
principles to guide future adjudication.
   “Justice Blackmun’s pragmatic approach underlay this concurring
opinion in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, in which
as the Solicitor General has noted, the Justice expressed his commit-
ment to the ultimate goal of a race-blind society. He concluded that the
achievement of that goal required the temporary use of race-conscious
measures. His statement, quoted by the Solicitor General, ‘in order to
get beyond racism, we must first take account of race,’ is reflective of
his view that the just solution of constitutional problems may depend
less upon abstract theorizing than on a dispassionate assessment of the
world as it is, and emphasizing that the Court must take account of
facts on the ground. Justice Blackmun stressed in particular the need
to appreciate the circumstances of persons who often seem invisible to
judges and lawyers.
   “From the outset, Justice Blackmun spoke for the Court in giving
meaning to the guarantee of equal protection in cases involving aliens
and the mentally ill. He also discussed the gratuitous suffering some-

258                    WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 27, 1999

times visited upon prison inmates and cautioned that society as a whole
bears responsibility for their humane treatment.
   “At the same time, however, Justice Blackmun’s real world approach
led him to recognize the deference due prison officials in implementing
legitimate prison interests to insure prison security and order. Justice
Blackmun’s Fourth Amendment jurisprudence similarly recognized
that intrusions on personal privacy that are not unduly onerous are a
necessary cost of living in a safe and orderly society. In a related vein,
it was the Justice’s exposure for more than 20 years to the actual opera-
tion of the capital punishment system that prompted him to conclude,
as expressed in his dissent in Callins v. Collins, that the constitutional
goal of eliminating arbitrariness and discrimination from the adminis-
tration of death . . . can never be achieved without compromising an
equally essential component of fundamental fairness—individualized
sentencing.
   “Most people strongly disagree with his conclusion, but no one who
watched Justice Blackmun move from dissent in Furman v. Georgia to
dissent in Callins can doubt the sincerity or effort this dedicated jurist
made to reconcile his own views about the death penalty with his re-
sponsibilities as a judge.
   “Many of Justice Blackmun’s notable opinions for the Court in areas
as diverse as federal and state taxation, expert evidence, separation of
powers, due process, and the commerce clause are discussed in the
resolution. One area in which the Justice’s opinions has had a particu-
larly lasting impact is the sphere of commercial speech. Justice Black-
mun wrote the opinions for the Court in Bigelow v. Virginia, Virginia
State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia State Consumers Council, and
Bates v. State Bar of Arizona. These decisions marked this Court’s
first recognition that speech proposing a commercial transaction is
entitled to First Amendment protection and they have provided the
foundation for the Court’s commercial speech jurisprudence.
   “Characteristically, Justice Blackmun did not ground his analysis in
abstract theory or in an absolutist conception of the First Amendment.
Rather, his opinions for the Court emphasized the substantial practical
interest of ordinary citizens in making informed choices concerning
possible uses of their money.
   “Justice Blackmun was a human being of deep and great kindness
and compassion, who remained always aware of the profound impact
of the law upon the community and the consequent responsibilities of
judges to the litigants who appear before them and to the community
at large. In his performance of those responsibilities, he epitomized the
highest ideals of public service.

particular, of the Bar of this Court, I respectfully request that the
resolutions presented to you in honor and in celebration of the memory
of Justice Harry A. Blackmun be accepted by the Court and that they,
together with the chronicle of these proceedings, be ordered kept for
all time in the records of this Court.”
   The Chief Justice said:
   “Thank you, Attorney General Reno and Solicitor General Waxman,
for your presentations today in memory of our late colleague and
friend, Justice Harry A. Blackmun. We also extend to Chairman Pam-
ela S. Karlan and the members of the Committee on Resolutions, Chair-
man David W. Odgen, and members of the Arrangements Committee,
and Harold H. Koh, Chairman of today’s meeting of the Bar our ap-
preciation for these appropriate resolutions.
   “Your motion that these resolutions be made a part of the permanent
records of the Court is granted.
   “Harry Blackmun’s service on this Court and his contribution to
American law will long be remembered. He was born in Illinois in 1908
and grew up in St. Paul, Minnesota. He was known when he first came
here along with Chief Justice Burger as the Minnesota twins, but Bill
Douglas always said they had the wrong people as the Minnesota
twins, because he was born in Minnesota so that he and Chief Justice
Burger should have been the Minnesota twins.
   “Harry Blackmun received a scholarship to Harvard University
where he majored in mathematics and graduated summa cum laude.
He began his legal career serving as a clerk to Judge John Sanborn on
the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. He practiced law for 16
years with the Dorsey firm in Minneapolis, and then he went to the
Mayo Clinic, became the first resident counsel there, where he com-
bined his love for both law and medicine.
   “In 1959, President Eisenhower nominated him to serve on the Court
of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit filling, appropriate enough, the va-
cant seat of Judge Sanborn, for whom he had clerked 26 years earlier.
After serving nine years on the Eighth Circuit, he was appointed by
President Nixon to a seat on the Supreme Court in 1970. He was the
98th Justice to serve on the Court and served for nearly a quarter of
a century. He was a worthy successor, as pointed out by the Solicitor
General, to the predecessors in the seat which he occupied, Joseph
Story, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Benjamin Cardozo, and Felix
Frankfurter.
   “During his years on the bench, Justice Blackmun spoke for the
Court in more than 350 opinions. The publicity which attended the Roe
v. Wade opinion, overshadowed some of the other important decisions

which he authored. These included Mistretta v. United States, in which
the sentencing guidelines were held to be constitutional, Daubert v.
Merrill-Dow Pharmaceuticals, which you mentioned, Solicitor Gen-
eral, concerned the admissibility of scientific evidence in federal courts,
and Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer
Council—you mentioned that, Attorney General Reno—which was a
very seminal opinion dealing with commercial speech. And in Complete
Auto Transit v. Brady, he enunciated for the Court the modern rule
that the commerce clause of the Constitution doesn’t prevent interstate
commerce from being required to bear its fair share of state taxation.
  “His legacy also includes Flood v. Kuhn which both held fast to base-
ball’s antitrust exemption and demonstrated Justice Blackmun’s knowl-
edge of the game and all its accompanying lore.
  “Moving to Washington from Minnesota in 1970 in no way diminished
his enthusiasm for the Minnesota Twins or the Minnesota Vikings, even
when they were playing the Washington Redskins.
  “Justice Blackmun was cautious and methodical in his judicial work.
He was the statistician for the conference, telling us at the close of
each meeting how many cases we had granted certiorari on in the
present term compared to the number we had granted in the preceding
term. He also brought a practical eye to the Court, as his many opin-
ions interpreting the Fourth Amendment illustrate, and in Wyman v.
James, which is one of his first opinions, in fact, it was his first majority
opinion on the Court, he rejected a challenge on behalf of the Court of a
Fourth Amendment challenge to a New York law conditioning welfare
benefits on in-home visits by caseworkers. Non-adversarial visits, he
wrote, were minimally intrusive and were designed to benefit depend-
ent children. In 1987, he authored the opinion for the Court of New
York v. Burger, in which a Fourth Amendment challenge to New York’s
law authorizing warrantless inspections of junkyards was rejected.
And in California v. Acevedo, Justice Blackmun wrote for the Court
that police may search a bag found in an automobile without a warrant.
  “Justice Blackmun’s opinions convey only a part of his legacy. He will
also be remembered for the personal qualities he brought to the Court
during his 24 years of service. He was a pensive and a compassionate
man. He will be remembered for this integrity, his high sense of justice,
and his exemplification of decency, modesty, and civility.
  “His friends here and on the Court and throughout the judiciary and
indeed, throughout the country, will continue to miss him.”

  Adjourned until Monday, November 1, 1999, at 10 o’clock.

duct of the same sort will be sanctioned more severely.”
