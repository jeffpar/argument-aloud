elevated levels of certain amino acids and deﬁcient levels of vitamin B.
The method consists of the following: First, measure the level of the
relevant amino acids using any device, whether the device is, or is not,
patented; second, notice whether the amino acid level is elevated and,
if so, conclude that a vitamin B deﬁciency exists. Is the patent invalid

SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES

  Present: Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice Stevens, Justice O’Connor,
Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, Justice Souter, Justice Thomas, Justice
Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer.

                      Order in Pending Case
   No. 04A977 (04–10180). Vernon Brown, Applicant v. Larry Craw­
ford, Director, Missouri Department of Corrections, et al. Application
for stay of execution of sentence of death presented to Justice Thomas
and by him referred to the Court denied. Temporary stay heretofore
entered vacated. Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg and Jus­
tice Breyer join, dissenting. Because the state has not disputed the
merits of petitioner’s challenge to the chemical protocol used by Mis­
souri to carry out lethal injections, I would grant the stay for the
reasons stated in Judge Bye’s dissenting opinion. Assuming the Prison
Litigation Reform Act of 1995 applies, see 42 U. S. C. § 1997e(a), the
state conceded at oral argument before the district court that there is
no available remedy that petitioner has failed to invoke. Justice Souter
would grant the application for stay of execution.


                         Certiorari Denied
  No. 04–9596 (04A935). Vernon Brown, Petitioner v. Missouri. Appli­
