SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES
Present: The Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Holmes, Mr. Justice Van
Devanter, Mr. Justice McReynolds, Mr. Justice Brandeis, Mr.
Justice Sutherland, Mr. Justice Butler, Mr. Justice Sanford, and
Mr. Justice Stone.
John O'Gara, of San Francisco, Calif.; Raymond Fellows, of

No. 6, original. The State of Oklahoma, complainant, v. The State
of Texas et al. On counterclaim filed by the State of Texas with
reference to the location of that portion of the boundary line ex-
tending northwardly along the one hundredth meridian from the
Red River to the parallel of 36 degrees 30 minutes north latitude,
which constitutes the eastern boundary of the Panhandle of Texas
and the main western boundary of Oklahoma. Conclusions:
Neither the Jones, Brown, and Clark line, nor the line running
north from the Kidder monument, has been established as the bound-
ary line; the boundary is the line of the true one hundredth meridian
extending north from its intersection with the south bank of the
South Fork of Red River to its intersection with the parallel of 36
degrees 30 minutes; and this line should now be accurately located
and marked by a commissioner or commissioners appointed by the
court, whose report shall be subject to its approval. The parties
may submit within 30 days the form of a decree to carry these
conclusions into effect. Opinion by Mr. Justice Sanford.
No. 127. The United States of America, appellant, v. The Chemi-

Mr. Justice Stone.

don, Va.; Ernest A. Landman, of Athens, Tex.; William C. Martin,
of Washington, D. C.; and Stanley Suydam, of Washington, D. C.,
were admitted to practice.
The Chief Justice said:
The Court announces with deep personal sorrow the death of
William Riley Stansbury, its clerk, at 5 o'clock on yesterday (Sun-
day) morning, June 5.
Mr. Stansbury was born May 25, 1856, so that he had reached the
age of 71. He was born, and has always lived, in this District,
except for a year or two spent in the Signal Service of the United
States. He entered this Court as an assistant clerk in August, 1882,
and has acted in every capacity as a subordinate in the clerk's office,
having succeeded Mr. James D. Maher as clerk in October, 1921, six
years ago. He was an accurate, faithful, earnest, and efficient public
servant. He was saturated with the traditions of the office and
familiar to the last detail with all the duties to be discharged in that
important place. He endeared himself in every relation to the
members of the Court. He was genial and accommodating and
interested for every member of the public, and especially every one
12934-27--104

MONDAY, JUNE 6, 1927
348
of the bar who had to transact business with the Court. He was a
man of the utmost probity and of highest character in every respect.
The Court takes great pride in the history of the maintenance of
the traditions of the clerk's office and of the length of service of
those who administered it. Mr. Bayard was appointed clerk in
1791 and served until 1800. Mr. Caldwell was appointed in 1800
and served until 1825. Mr. Carroll was appointed in 1827 and
served until 1863. Mr. Middleton was appointed in 1863 and served
until 1880. Mr. James H. McKenney was appointed in 1880, having
been for years the chief assistant of Mr. Middleton, and served until
1913. Mr. James D. Maher, having for many years since boyhood
been an assistant in the clerk's office, was appointed clerk in 1913
and served until 1921. Mr. Stansbury having been appointed assist-
ant clerk in 1882, and having served as the head of the office for six
years, looked back to a record of forty-five years. Such lengths of
service indicate not only fidelity but efficiency, for only by reason
of the latter could the incumbents have continued during the term
they served.
Because the Court adjourns this morning for the term of 1926, and
for more than three months, and because no successor to Mr. Stans-
bury could be appointed during the vacation, it has been necessary
for the Court, in spite of Mr. Stansbury's very recent death, to
appoint his successor, in order that the successor may be installed,
give his bonds, and begin the administration of his office, which,
because of its public obligations, can not be suspended at all.
Mr. Philander Riley Stansbury, the brother of the late Clerk,
has been an assistant for more than 30 years and has rendered faith-
ful services. Because of the state of his health he has declined to
be considered for the succession.
The Court has appointed as its Clerk, to succeed Mr. Stansbury,
Charles Elmore Cropley, of Washington. Mr. Cropley has already
served in the Court as Page and Assistant some 18 years, but is still
in the prime of life. He has great familiarity with the duties of the
office and carries with him to its headship the traditions that have
secured such distinguished and useful service by Mr. Stansbury and
his predecessors, with the probability of a life of long usefulness.
The members of the court will attend the funeral of Mr. Stansbury
in a body, at half past 10 to-morrow (Tuesday) morning, at St.
Andrews Episcopal Church, at the corner of Fifteenth and V Streets.
ORDER
It is hereby ordered that Charles Elmore Cropley be appointed
Clerk of this Court in the place of William R. Stansbury, deceased,
and that he forthwith take the oath of office and give bond condi-
tioned according to law.
