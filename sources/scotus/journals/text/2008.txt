Scalia. Opinion by Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice, Jus­
tice Kennedy, and Justice Alito join, concurring in part and dissenting
in part.
   The Chief Justice said:
   “Case No. 08–205, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission,
is set for re-argument later this Term, on Wednesday, September 9,
2009, at 10 a.m. Parties should address the following question: For
proper disposition of this case, should the Court overrule either Austin
v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U. S. 652 (1990), and the part
of McConnell v. Federal Election Commission, 540 U. S. 93 (2003),
which addressed the facial validity of Section 203 of the Bipartisan
Campaign Reform Act of 2002, 2 U. S. C. § 441b?
   “And now we note with sadness that this is the last session in which
our friend and colleague, Justice David Souter, will be on the Bench
with us. He has served on this Court faithfully and with great distinc­
tion since October 1990. We wish him the best in his well-deserved
retirement. On this occasion, we have sent Justice Souter a letter that
I will now read. It’s dated today.
   “Dear David, we have all felt a profound sense of loss since the an­
nouncement of your decision to retire. For nearly twenty years, the
Court has had the beneﬁt of your wisdom, civility, and dedication to
the cause of justice. Your keen intellect and broad knowledge have
enlarged our deliberations and enriched the Court’s jurisprudence. We
deeply value the times we have shared in judicial service. We under­
stand your desire to trade white marble for White Mountains, and re­
turn to your land “of easy wind and downy ﬂake.” Though you will not
be among us in our daily labors, we are grateful that the privilege of
your sturdy friendship will endure long beyond your departure from
the bench and tables we have shared. Affectionately, and the letter is
signed by all of us on the Bench and by Justice O’Connor.”
   Justice Souter said: “I’ve written the following reply.”
   “Dear Colleagues, your generous letter has touched me more than I
can say and I will only try to leave you with some sense of what our
common service has meant to me. You quoted the Poet, and I will, too,
in words that set out the ideal of the life engaged, “ ‘... where love and
need are one....’ ” That phrase accounts for the ﬁnest moments of my
life on this Court, as we have agreed or contended with each other
over those things that matter to decent people in a civil society. For
nineteen Terms. I have lived that life with you, all of us sharing our
own best years with one another, working side by side as fellow serv­
ants and as friends.

  I will not sit with you at our bench again after the Court rises for
the Summer this time, but neither will I retire from our friendship,
which has held us together despite the pull of the most passionate
dissent. It has made the work lighter through all my tenure here, and
for as long as I live, I will be thankful for it, and be under a very
grateful obligation to each one of you. Yours affectionately, David.”
  The Chief Justice said:
  “I am now authorized to announce that the Court has acted on all
but one case submitted for decision this Term. Disposition of items
scheduled for conference today will be reﬂected on the Order List that
will be released later today. The Court will be in recess from today
until Wednesday, September 9, 2009.
  “My colleagues and I thank the members of the Court staff for their
superb work and dedication to duty. The outstanding work done by the
members of the Court staff contributes signiﬁcantly to the accomplish­
ment of the Court’s mission. We also thank the members of the Court’s
Bar for their professionalism and cooperation.”


  Adjourned until Wednesday, September 9, 2009, at 10 o’clock.

   “We are pleased to have with us today the President of the United

are also pleased to have present Vice President Biden and our retired
colleague, Justice Souter. Welcome Mr. Vice President and welcome
back, Justice Souter. The Court now recognizes the Attorney General
of the United States, Eric Holder.”
   Attorney General Holder said:
   “Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I have the Commis­
sion which has been issued to the Honorable Sonia Sotomayor as Asso­
ciate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. The Commis­
sion has been duly signed by the President of the United States and

trust and conﬁdence in the wisdom, uprightness, and learning of Sonia
Sotomayor, of New York, I have nominated, and, by and with the ad­
vice and consent of the Senate, do appoint her an Associate Justice of
the Supreme Court of the United States and do authorize and empower
