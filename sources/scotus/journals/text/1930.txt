16476-30-36

MONDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1930

the rehearing recently has been had. Upon this further consider-
ation the Court adheres to the view that the writ of certiorari should
be dismissed for want of jurisdiction, but the members of the Court
differ in the reasons which lead to that decision:
66
Mr. Justice Van Devanter, Mr. Justice McReynolds, Mr. Justice
Sutherland, and Mr. Justice Butler concur in this disposition of the
case, upon the rehearing, for the following reasons: The state court
found that the petitioners here "did not make a bona fide effort
to make the street-railway business a success," but planned to dis-
continue it and pursued a course tending to depress the business
and make it unremunerative; that "if the street-car system had been
properly maintained, as it could and should have been, the same
would have been patronized by the public generally "; and that the
street-railway system can be made to yield a fair return if properly
managed and properly maintained." These findings, although op-
posed to part of the evidence, have such support in other parts that
they should be accepted here. In the presence of such findings, so
supported, it is apparent that on the present record petitioners are
not in a position to maintain that enforced operation of the street-
railway system will be in contravention of rights secured by the
due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. An essen-
tial basis in matter of fact for the right sought to be asserted
under that constitutional provision is wanting; and as this is true
regardless of whether the electric street railway franchise be inde-
pendent or so unified with other franchises as to be interdependent,
there is no present need to consider or determine its status in that
regard.
The Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Holmes, Mr. Justice Brandeis, and
Mr. Justice Stone adhere to the views expressed in the opinion
heretofore delivered, 281 U. S. 537.
Mr. Justice Roberts, considering himself disqualified, took no
part in the decision of this case.

Mr. Attorney General Mitchell addressed the Court as follows:
"May it please the court:
"During the December recess of this Court members of its Bar
assembled here to express their profound regret at the death of
William Howard Taft, tenth Chief Justice of the United States,
and to make a permanent record of their high regard for his devoted
public service. That gathering included many men, themselves
distinguished for public service, lifelong friends of the late Chief
Justice, who paid eloquent and loving tribute to his memory. A
minute was prepared, reviewing the principal events of his career,
and the following resolutions were adopted:
"William Howard Taft was born in the city of Cincinnati, Ohio,
September 15, 1857. He was graduated with distinction at Yale
University in 1878 and at the Cincinnati Law School in 1880. He
was called to public service within a year after his admission to the
bar, first as Assistant Prosecuting Attorney at Hamilton County,
Ohio, and then as Assistant County Solicitor. In 1887 he was ap-
pointed by Governor Foraker to succeed Hon. Judson Harmon as
. judge of the Superior Court of Cincinnati. Three years later, in
1890, he was appointed by President Harrison Solicitor General
of the United States. After two years' service in that office he was
appointed Circuit Judge of the United States for the Sixth Judicial
Circuit. His three years' service in the Ohio State Court had given

Mr. Taft not only an insight into the interest and importance of
the judicial office, but had awakened in him a love of the judicial
function which deeply marked his character and colored his entire
future career. He threw himself with ardor into the varied work
of a federal circuit judge, which at that period required him to sit
in courts of first instance, at law and in equity, and even on the
criminal side, as well as to participate with his associates in the
appellate work which the Evarts Act of 1890 devolved upon the
newly created Circuit Court of Appeals, a jurisdiction which in a
large and important class of cases was final. By his learning and
industry, his keen sense of values, his broad human understanding
and his appreciation of the supreme importance of the administra-
tion of justice, Judge Taft soon established a high reputation as
one of the ablest members of the federal judiciary. In the year
1896 Judge Taft, in connection with Judson Harmon, Lawrence
Maxwell, and others, reorganized the Cincinnati Law School, adopted
the Harvard case book method of teaching, and started it upon a
career of enlarged activity. He accepted the position of dean, as
well as lecturer on real property law, and discharged the duties of
both those positions until his resignation from the bench in 1900.
"When the termination of the war with Spain left the United
States with the responsibility for the future of the Philippine
Islands, President McKinley called upon Judge Taft to head a com-
mission of distinguished Americans to proceed to those islands,
study the conditions prevailing in them, and make a report with
recommendations as to the future relations of the Government of
the United States to those islands and their people. There was little
in his assignment which appealed to a Federal judge devoted to
his judicial work and ardently believing that the administration
of justice was the supreme concern of mankind. But the appoint-
ment was tendered him by the President as a call to public duty, and
such an appeal never was made to him in vain. At the conclusion
of the work of the Philippine Commission Mr. Taft was appointed
first civil governor of the islands, serving in that capacity until
February 1, 1904, when he was appointed Secretary of War in the
Cabinet of President Roosevelt, from which he resigned in June,
1908, because of his impending nomination for the Presidency, to
which he was elected in November of that year. Space is lacking.
here for an appraisal of the value of the distinguished public
service rendered by Mr. Taft as civil governor of the Philippines,
as Secretary of War, or as President of the United States. But
it is peculiarly appropriate to this occasion to note that few Presi-
dents, if any, have been called upon to appoint so large a number
of Federal judges as he, and by none was a higher standard of
learning and personal character required in his nominees. During

MONDAY, JUNE 1, 1931
346
his four years of the presidency he selected five Associate Justices
and one Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.
The choice of the Chief Justice gave him more anxious thought than
any other. Departing from precedents, he nominated to the chief
justiceship an associate justice of the court, Edward D. White, of
Louisiana, who also was a Democrat and a former Confederate
soldier. This nomination was promptly confirmed by the Senate
and met with universal approval on the part of the bar and the
people of the country. It had been Mr. Taft's greatest ambition
himself to become Chief Justice, and in selecting Judge White for
that position he was putting another man into the only post in the
Government he had ever really yearned to fill. On June 21, 1921,
President Harding appointed Mr. Taft Chief Justice to succeed
Chief Justice White, who had died a month earlier, and on the
retirement of Chief Justice Taft himself, very shortly before his
death, President Hoover appointed as his successor Charles Evans
Hughes, whom President Taft had appointed an Associate Justice
of the Supreme Court in 1910 (and who had resigned to accept
the Republican nomination for the Presidency in 1916).
"Mr. Taft is the only American in our history who was the head
of two of the three equal and coordinate branches of our Government.
But the bench was his career of predilection and he brought to the
office of Chief Justice devotion to and enthusiasm in its work, as well
as the experience of his long, useful, and varied life in the public
service. Aside from his strictly judicial work, the two outstanding
events in the history of the court during his incumbency are (1) the
passage of the act which greatly limited the number of appeals as
of right to the Supreme Court from the final decisions of the Circuit
Courts of Appeals, substituting for the right of appeal a discretion-
ary power of review by writ of certiorari, and (2) the enactment by
Congress of a law authorizing the construction of a building in which
to house the Court and its offices, and the passage of appropriations
adequate for the construction of a dignified and beautiful structure,
the selection of a site, and the preparation and approval of the plans
for the building. To the securing of both of these measures and
the planning of the new court building, the Chief Justice devoted
much thought and energy, appearing in person before the appropri-
ate congressional committees to fully present all the reasons which
had made him an advocate of these measures. His work on the. court
as reflected in his opinions speaks for itself. The number of opinions
he wrote was surprisingly large, and the vigor, clarity, and sureness
of touch which they express demonstrate his unquestioned title to a
place high in the ranks of the leaders in the American judiciary.
This brief sketch of the Chief Justice would be incomplete without
an allusion to those personal qualities which endeared him to many

MONDAY, JUNE 1, 1931
347
people of high and low degree throughout the land. In the truest
sense of the word he was a great humanitarian, feeling the keenest
sense of sympathy and interest in all that concerned men of all sorts
and condition. He truly loved his fellows. He had compassion
even for the erring. He found something good in everybody, but
no mere sentimentality ever clouded his judgment or stayed the im-
petuous vigor of his condemnation of dishonesty or mere pretense.
Not less characteristic than his broad sympathy was his genial and
rescuing sense of humor. Sentiment balanced by humor produced in
him a rare sanity of judgment and added to his great gifts of charac-
ter and intellect the charm of a gracious and winsome personality.
"It is now resolved, That the Bar of the Supreme Court of the
United States do hereby record their high appreciation of the long
record of devoted and effective service rendered by William Howard
Taft to the people of the United States in the many public employ-
ments to which he was called, and especially in the exalted office of
Chief Justice of the United States.
"Further resolved, That the Attorney General be asked to present
these resolutions to the Court and to request that they be inscribed
upon its permanent records. And that the chairman of this meeting
be requested to transmit a copy of the resolutions to the family of the
late Chief Justice, together with the assurance of the sincere sympa-
thy of the Bar in the great and irremediable loss they have sustained.'
"In obedience to those resolutions I am here to present them and
ask that they be entered in the records of the Court.
"Chief Justice Taft was my good friend, and I am grateful for
the tradition which gives to the office I hold the high privilege of
representing the Bar on this occasion.
"The only man to hold the two greatest offices in the gift of the
American people, he had a public career unparalleled in its variety,
with great distinction as a teacher, a colonial administrator, and
executive, but it is fitting in memorial exercises by the members of
the profession which he loved, and for the archives of this Court,
that we speak chiefly of his service to the Court and to the cause of
justice, and first of that part of his work recorded in the official
reports.
"During his service as Chief Justice the Court delivered fifteen
hundred and ninety-six (1,596) opinions. One-ninth of that number
is one hundred and seventy-seven. He delivered two hundred and
fifty-three opinions for the Court, or one-sixth of the total. The
nature of the cases and the labor required in each would have to be
examined to judge accurately of his relative efforts, but he did his
share.
"This is not the occasion to review his judicial opinions at length,
but a study of them reveals these things. His public life and expe-

MONDAY, JUNE 1, 1931
348
rience as an administrator and executive had developed a wisdom
and common sense which are disclosed in these writings. His opin-
ions are of the kind which are useful to lawyers. They not only
decided the cases presented but they are charts for the future. The
style is simple and direct, and he never clouded his thought by self-
consciousness in expression. His judgments disclose prodigious
energy expended in study and research.
"In assigning cases to members of the Court for preparation of
opinions he gave to himself at least an equal share of those dull ones
which were interspersed with the important matters before the
Court. He seemed to take a special interest in patent and trade-
mark cases.
He had an unusual facility in that field, and wrote
many fine opinions in important patent litigation. It is in constitu-
tional law that his greatest judicial work was done. Of his two hun-
dred and fifty-three opinions seventy dealt with important constitu-
tional questions. That in the Myers case, settling a controversy as
old as the Union, respecting the President's exclusive power of re-
moving executive officers, alone would mark him a great constitu-
tional lawyer. The opinions he delivered from this bench, together
with two hundred and four others, rendered during his service as a
United States Circuit Judge, form an enduring monument to his
high judicial qualities.
66
Beyond his performance of the routine tasks of a Chief Justice
is other service for which we should be grateful.
"When he began his work here as Chief Justice the Court was
eighteen months behind in disposing of the cases before it. He took
a leading part in devising and procuring the passage by Congress
of the act of February 13, 1925, which gave the Court a wide discre-
tion to decide what cases should be brought before it for review, and
with that change in procedure as a starting point he and his asso-
ciates set about the task of bringing the work up to date with such
determination and driving force that at the end of his service as
Chief Justice in February, 1930, the business of the Court was prac-
tically current, and with the completion of that task during the
past year it may no longer be said that appeals to this Court are a
means of delaying justice or allowing criminals to postpone punish-
ment. Under his leadership this Court has set an example to the
courts of the land, and brought home to the profession that it should
no longer be taken for granted that courts must always be behind
in their work.
"During his incumbency Congress enacted the laws authorizing
the construction of a building to be occupied by the Court and its
officers. He had largely to do with that and gave constant thought
and effort to obtaining the necessary appropriations, acquiring the
site, and above all in seeing to it that the building when completed

MONDAY, JUNE 1, 1931
349
shall be a dignified and beautiful structure. This project was dear
to his heart, and we regret that he did not live to see the fulfillment
of his efforts. The new Supreme Court building when completed
will itself be a memorial of one of his services to the Court.
"He had much to do with the enactment of the law authorizing
the judicial conference presided over by the Chief Justice and at-
tended by the senior circuit judges of the ten judicial circuits,
which annually considers the operation of our Federal judicial sys-
tem for the purpose of bringing about administrative and legisla-
tive changes to increase efficiency in the administration of justice.
"By his influence for a high standard in judicial appointments
he rendered inestimable service to the cause of justice. As Presi-
dent he appointed five associate justices and one Chief Justice of
this Court and many judges of the other Federal courts. He spoke
of this Court as the chief bulwark of the institutions of civil lib-
erty created by the Constitution, and viewed the appointment of
members of the Court as the most sacred duty with which he, as
President, was charged. During all his public career, in whatever
office he held, his influence was exerted to elevate the standards for
judicial appointments and to combat the pressure of political
expediency for the selection of mediocre men.
66
With all the other demands upon him, he took time to see old
friends, to find new ones, to address gatherings of his fellow citi-
zens, and to make those many public appearances expected of one
in his position. His big, warm personality, kindliness, and humor,
with that infectious chuckle of his, will never be forgotten by those
who knew him.
"None of our institutions is so impregnable that popular confi-
dence in and respect for it are not to be desired, and it is well for
this Court and for the constitutional rights and liberties which it
guards, each time there is chosen for Chief Justice one who in the
public estimation is so preeminently fitted that his appointment is
generally acclaimed. Chief Justice Taft had that fortunate dis-
tinction. What training for this high office could have excelled his?
From early youth he was continuously in the public service. Within
a year after his admission to the Bar he became prosecuting attorney
of his county, then judge of a Superior Court. Forty-one years ago,
in this very spot where I now stand, he commenced his service for
the Nation, as Solicitor General of the United States, and with but
a short interlude continued in the nation's service until he ended it,
again in this room as Chief Justice of the United States. From
Solicitor General to United States Circuit Judge, then president of
the Philippine Commission, civil governor of the Philippine Islands,
special representative of his Government on delicate diplomatic
missions, Secretary of War, and President. What a preparation for

high judicial office! When finally the opportunity came to place
him on this Court the whole nation knew that he was qualified by
character, learning, and experience. It trusted him and believed
in his judicial qualities and in his big-hearted understanding of the
problems of plain people.
"He had always yearned for service on this Court. His was a
judicial mind. Political life was not congenial to him but fate
seemed bound to draw him against his will into the field of political
and executive action. It has been said that because of his judicial
instincts it was hard for him to adjust himself to the thoughts and
feelings and methods of political life in a party sense. Nevertheless,
twice he regretfully refused appointment as an Associate Justice of
this Court because he felt he could not desert administrative
responsibilities.
"He made no secret of his interest in judicial work. Millions of
his fellow countrymen knew of these things and sympathized with
his aspirations. They held him in affectionate regard. When in
1912 his party, torn by dissension, went down to defeat and he failed
of reelection to the Presidency, his lack of bitterness or rancor, his
smiling acceptance of his defeat, his frank and humorous public
statement that he had retired from the Presidency with the full con-
sent of the American people, met with instant response in the public
mind, and from that moment, to an extraordinary degree, he found
a place in the affections of the Nation. So when he came at last to
the great office of Chief Justice he had the entire confidence and
respect of great numbers of his fellow citizens. He held them to the
end. His very presence on this Court quickened public interest in
its functions, strengthened it in the public regard, and helped to
maintain it as the bulwark of the Constitution."
The Chief Justice said:
"Mr. Attorney General, in receiving the resolutions which you
have presented we recognize that of all the tributes that have been
paid to the memory of this eminent statesman and jurist there could
be none which would have been more highly prized by him than this
tribute coming from the profession which he loved in recognition of
the distinction of his service to the cause which was nearest to his
heart.
66
Blessed by forbears who had achieved high repute by virtue of
eminent talent and public spirit, it may be said that William Howard
Taft was born to the purple of the highest advantages which our
democracy affords. It was natural that his winning personality,
giving play to marked ability, without suggestion of condescension,
and distinguished by a nobility of character which scorned all that
was sordid, base, or narrow, should have opened early the door of

MONDAY, JUNE 1, 1931
351
opportunity for public service. The gracious leadership of his
youth in the circle of the university prefigured the position which
he at once took at the junior bar, and after showing his mettle in his
native city as prosecutor and judge, he came, at the age of thirty-
three, to the office of Solicitor General of the United States. From
that time until his death he exemplified in varied undertakings of
grave responsibility the finest type of public servant and enjoyed
an increasing general esteem, until, in the closing years, after the
wounds of political strife had been healed and the victories of a
magnanimous spirit had been acclaimed, he was enriched beyond
any man of his time with the wealth of universal affection.
"In other places there have been, and will be, appropriate apprecia-
tion of his services as the representative of his country in novel and
important duties as executive head of the new government in the
Philippines, and as Secretary of War and Chief Magistrate of the
Republic. It is for us to recognize with gratitude, and with a deep
sense of obligation and of loss, his labors in this Court, which
brought his career to the fullness of illustrious accomplishment.
"Chief Justice Taft came to this service with a prestige which
added weight to his pronouncements. But in the realm of lofty and
conspicuous endeavor, success is never guaranteed by past achieve-
ments. It must be rewon daily, and even the highest prestige is put
to fresh proof by the inescapable responsibilities of decision. Chief
Justice Taft entered the Court with a distinguished reputation, but
he left it with an even greater fame securely established.
66
This was due to his special qualifications for judicial office, by
virtue of training, aptitude, and temperament. His training began,
as I have said, almost as soon as he was admitted to the bar. When
he took executive office at the age of forty-three he had served nearly
eleven years upon the bench and for eight of these years as United
States Circuit Judge. In that work he was indefatigable, not only
in the Circuit Court of Appeals but at trial terms. One who knew
intimately his labors in those days has said that Judge Taft became.
known to the bar of his circuit as no other circuit judge had ever
been before or has been since. Nor was he content with the range
of his judicial duty, but in his enthusiasm for legal study he took a
leading part in law school organization and teaching. The learning
and strength of his judicial opinions as a Circuit Judge made him
widely known. His interest was not simply in the right adjudication
of particular cases, but in jurisprudence, and he consistently labored
in the interest of system and coherence. It was his effort to master
the special subject in hand so as to utilize it in giving a chart for the
future. A conspicuous instance of this is his opinion for the Circuit
Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit in Addyston Pipe & Steel Com-

MONDAY, JUNE 1, 1931
352
pany v. United States, delivered in 1898 (85 Fed. 271), containing
what was, at that time, perhaps the most thorough exposition in the
American reports of the law relating to restraint of trade. The
judicial service of his young manhood was rendered with a zest which
never abated. And his duties and experiences in executive office
heightened for him the never-failing charm of the judicial career, by
reason of its independence and impartiality, and its devotion to what
he believed to be the paramount interests of the administration of
justice. Having begun as a student of the law, he returned to his
legal studies when released from executive responsibilities, and as a
lecturer on constitutional law he completed his preparation for the
great task to which manifest destiny was to call him.
"To Chief Justice Taft, the administration of justice was never
an abstract conception, to be extolled in vain phrases and with but
slight regard to changes in social conditions and to existing defi-
ciencies. While holding in contempt the fanciful schemes with
which the administration of justice in this country is threatened
from time to time he was ever pointing out its shortcomings and
laboring for its improvement by practicable remedies. It was this
concern which gave him a peculiar sensitiveness with respect to the
qualifications for judicial office. He realized profoundly that the
chief defects of the administration of justice lie in men rather
than in method. A good judge, using the means at the command
of an alert and informed mind, will find but rarely that he can not
force his way through to effective action. No duty seemed to Presi-
dent Taft more important than that of selecting federal judges.
It was his special concern while he had the responsibility of appoint-
ment, and his solicitude continued and was constantly expressed
after he became Chief Justice. It has fallen to but three Presidents
since Washington to appoint a majority of the members of this
Court. President Jackson appointed Chief Justice Taney and four
Associate Justices. President Lincoln apopinted Chief Justice Chase
and four Associate Justices. President Taft appointed Chief Justice
White and five Associate Justices. In no act of Mr. Taft's career
was his estimate of the requirements of judicial office and his em-
phasis upon its proper independence of partisan considerations
more strikingly shown than in his appointment of Chief Justice
White, of a different political faith, but who had represented upon
the bench the highest standards of judicial conduct. And we are
admonished of the rapidity of the changes in this Court, despite the
apparent permanence afforded by the tenure of office, when we reflect
that when Chief Justice Taft came to the bench ten years ago only
two of his appointees were still in service.
"No learning or information comes amiss to a Justice of this Court.
Its members have been drawn from many fields of activity, and to
16476-31-104

MONDAY, JUNE 1, 1931
353
its conferences are brought the wisdom derived from varied experi-
ences in different parts of our land. By reason of the variety and
importance of his previous official duties, Chief Justice Taft had in
this respect an unusual equipment. The learning and industry of
the judge was reenforced by the special knowledge gained in state-
craft. He had abundant opportunity to apply this knowledge, and
it was applied with judicial independence. As illustrating this, and
also as exhibiting the quality of his judicial opinions, reference
may be made to Balzac v. Porto Rico (258 U. S. 298) and Yu Cong
Eng v. Trinidad (271 U. S. 500), dealing with fundamental ques-
tions relating to the administration of our insular possessions; to
Stafford v. Wallace (258 U. S. 495), sustaining and construing the
Packers and Stockyards Act; to Ex parte Grossman (267 U. S. 87),
upholding the power of the President to pardon criminal contempts;
and to Myers v. United States (272 U. S. 52), sustaining the Presi-
dent's power of removal.
Because of the interest which he had shown throughout his public
life in the problems affecting labor, Mr. Taft was appointed, when
the United States entered the War in 1917, cochairman of the War
Labor Board. And when he came to this Court no one had a more
intimate knowledge of labor conditions in this country or was more
highly respected by all those concerned in industry, whether as
employers, managers, or employees. There can be no doubt of his
special interest in the decisions of this Court affecting labor ques-
tions, and upon these questions he delivered many of the Court's most
important opinions; as, for example, in American Steel Foundries
v. Tri-City Central Trades Council (257 U. S. 184); in United States
Mine Workers v. Coronado Coal Company (259 U. S. 344 and 268
U. S. 295); in the Pennsylvania Railroad Company Cases relating
to the function of the United States Railroad Labor Board (261
U. S. 172 and 267 U. S. 203); and in Charles Wolff Packing Com-
pany v. Industrial Court of Kansas (262 U. S. 522) with respect to
the extent of the authority of the State in the regulation of wages in
industry.
"Chief Justice Taft had also the technical knowledge and apti-
tude which gave him a special interest and authority in patent
cases, and his skill in this difficult branch of jurisprudence is illus-
trated in such leading opinions as those in Eibel Process Company v.
Minnesota & Ontario Paper Company (261 U. S. 45) and Corona
Cord Tire Company v. Dovan Chemical Corporation (276 U. S.
358). The Chief Justice always had an open mind with respect to
the necessary adaptation of the authority of government, espe-
cially in relation to the broadening requirements of interstate com-
merce under modern conditions. This was conspicuously shown in
the opinions that be delivered for the Court as to the power given

MONDAY, JUNE 1, 1931
354
to the Interstate Commerce Commission by the Transportation Act
of 1920, among which may be noted, as of permanent importance
because of the principles definitely established, those in the cases
of Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, Burlington &
Quincy Railroad Company (257 U. S. 563), relating to the power
of the Interstate Commerce Commission over intrastate rates, and
Dayton-Goose Creek Railway Company v. United States (263 U. S.
456), with respect to the recapture provisions of the Interstate Com-
merce Act. To the growing volume of jurisprudence dealing with
controversies between States, he made a notable contribution, espe-
cially in the case of the Chicago Drainage Canal (278 U. S. 367)
and in that of North Dakota v. Minnesota which clearly laid down
the essential bases for recovery by one State claiming injury by
reason of operations conducted by another. I have not attempted
the impossible task of making, upon such an occasion as this, a com-
prehensive survey or even a just estimate of the judicial service
of the late Chief Justice, and I have sought to cite but a few of
the many important opinions in which he touched every department
of the law as laid down by this Court and which stand as imperish-
able memorials to his ability and conscientious labor.
"Chief Justice Taft had, as has well been said, 'an almost re-
ligious reverence' for the fundamental principles of our system of
government. To quote his own words: 'In the Federal Constitution
there were embodied two great principles, first, that the Government
should be a representative popular government, in which every class
in society, the members of which have intelligence to know what
will benefit them, is given a voice in selecting the representatives
who are to carry on the government and in determining its general
policy. On the other hand, the same constitution exalts the per-
sonal rights and opportunities of the individual and prescribes the
judicial machinery for their preservation, against the infringement
by the majority of the electorate in whose hands was placed the
direction of the executive and legislative branches of the govern-
ment.' That was his confession of faith. And he had no sympathy
with any attempt to undermine the fundamental protection of fair
individual opportunity upon the assumption that social riches could
be gained through individual impoverishment. He stood emphati-
cally for the limitations of government under the Constitution and
was unwilling to see these limitations exceeded even when legislative
phrases were used which would otherwise have been appropriate to
the exercise of legislative power. This was conspicuously shown by
his opinion in delivering the judgment of the Court holding invalid
the child labor tax law (259 U. S. 20) as infringing upon the re-
served power of the States. 'To give any such magic,' he said, as
was sought to be attributed, 'to the word "tax" would be to break

MONDAY, JUNE 1, 1931
355
down all constitutional limitation of the powers of Congress and
completely wipe out the sovereignty of the States.' But he did not
regard the country, as he expressed it, as 'tied to the defects of the
past or present,' and he looked for a sure progress through discrimi-
nating and far-sighted legislators and through judges of broad
vision but imbued with the spirit of the Constitution.
"Chief Justice Taft rarely dissented. In the multitude of cases
to which you have referred, Mr. Attorney General, which were de-
cided during his incumbency, I find but seventeen in which he ex-
pressed dissent and in but three of these did he write the dissenting
opinion.
"Deeply concerned with improvements in administration the
Chief Justice gave special attention to his own duty as administrator.
Even the distinction of his contribution to the jurisprudence of the
Court does not obscure, but throws into a stronger light, by reason
of his versatility, his preeminence in the executive department of its
work. In the successful endeavor to end the delays which bring such
a deserved reproach upon judicial procedure, he was ever a leader,
and he would have been the first to recognize the able support which
he received from his colleagues in this effort. It was not a vain
attempt to bring the Court up to its work by a spasmodic activity,
but the intelligent formulation of a plan which receiving the sanction
of Congress has put the Court, we trust permanently, upon a basis
by which it can keep abreast of the demands upon it. So long as we
follow the example which he has set and avail ourselves of the oppor-
tunity which his leadership provided, the delays of justice will have
no countenance or illustration here.
"But the Chief Justice was not content with expediting the work
of this Court. He felt a special responsibility with respect to the
entire Federal judicial system. Many years before he came to this
bench he had suggested that either the Supreme Court or the Chief
Justice should have an adequate executive force to keep current
watch upon the business awaiting dispatch in all the districts and
circuits of the United States and to make a periodical estimate of
the number of judges needed in the various districts and to make
the requisite assignments. In a different manner, it was sought to
attain the object he had in view by the establishment, in 1922,
through his persistence, of the Judicial Conference of the Senior
Circuit Judges, held annually, at which the Chief Justice of this
Court presides, and which considers the needs of judicial service in
the different districts and makes recommendations accordingly.
This is an instrumentality of great value, and what it has accom-
plished and the promise of what it may achieve are due in the
largest measure to the foresight and intelligent guidance of Chief
Justice Taft.

MONDAY, JUNE 1, 1931

"No appreciation of the late Chief Justice can stop with ap-
praisal of his intellectual power, or his juristic and executive achieve-
ments, or his moral worth. The glow of his warm heart shone
through all his activities and irradiated all his associations. As
with every virile character, he had ardent sympathies and strong
dislikes. But he could not cherish ill will or long harbor a sense of
injury. He carried with him an invincible armor of kindliness
against which the shafts of opponents had proved harmless. With
him, service in the temple of justice was not an austere perform-
ance, with the ill-grace of an unnatural aloofness, but a necessary
human endeavor, with the dignity of lofty purpose, but pursued
with a benignity and an affection for his fellows which made his
presence in that temple a constant benediction.
"I should, in these last words, permit those to speak who were
associated with him in this work, and I can do no better than to
quote what they said to him upon his retirement: 'You came to
us from achievements in other fields, and with the prestige of the
illustrious place that you lately had held, and you showed in a new
form your voluminous capacity for work and for getting work
done, your humor that smoothed the rough places, your golden
heart that has brought you love from every side, and, most of all,
from your brethren whose tasks you have made happy and light.'
66 There are those here who have witnessed these memorial exer-
cises in honor of three Chief Justices. In the midst of our efforts,
engrossed with present demands, we are moving with a steady and
inescapable progress toward the inevitable end. The figures of
to-day, like those of yesterday, will soon be replaced, and the best
endeavors, striking as they may be in their immediate aspect, will
soon form but the background of another picture. Without illu-
sion, and with steady will, we continue in our task, heartened by the
exemplars of our faith, among whom no one has a more inspiring
or abiding influence than that of the late Chief Justice."
Mr. Attorney General Mitchell addressed the Court as follows:
"May it please the Court:
"On the very day of the death of the late Chief Justice, Edward
Terry Sanford, Associate Justice, was suddenly stricken and died.
Representatives of the Bar, gathered to pay reverent tribute to his
memory, adopted resolutions, which it is now my privilege to present
to the Court with the request that they be entered in its records
as a token of the high esteem in which Justice Sanford was held
by the legal profession.
666
Resolved, That the members of the Bar of the Supreme Court
desire to express their profound regret at the death of Edward
Terry Sanford, late Justice of the Supreme Court, and to record

MONDAY, JUNE 1, 1931
357
their high appreciation of his life and character and of his con-
spicuous and faithful service to his country. He was born on July
23, 1865, in the State of Tennessee. He graduated from the Univer-
sity of Tennessee and then entered Harvard College, where he con-
tinued his studies; later on, studying in European universities and
at the Harvard Law School. He became a member of the Bar of
the State of Tennessee and practiced at Knoxville and throughout the
State until the year 1907, when he became one of the Assistant
Attorneys General of the United States. After a year in Wash-
ington he accepted the office of United States District Judge for
the Middle and Eastern Districts of Tennessee. He served as such
District Judge for fifteen years with marked ability and with the
love and respect of the bar and community. He gave much of his
time to the cause of education; was chairman of the board of
trustees of the George Peabody College for Teachers; also trustee
of the University of Tennessee. He was at one time president of
the Alumni Association of the University of Tennessee and, later,
president of the Alumni Association of Harvard College. In the
year 1923 President Harding named him as Justice of the Supreme
Court to fill the vacancy arising upon the resignation of Justice
Pitney. He served on this Court with great distinction from the
time of his qualification until his untimely death on the 8th day of
March, 1930, at the early age of sixty-four. He had a personality of
unusual charm and was a most gifted speaker. He was a lover of
literature and the arts, was widely read, and deeply experienced in
law and jurisprudence. He had ardent patriotism and a high sense
of public duty. His work upon the Supreme Court was thorough,
conscientious, and exacting, and had the high commendation of his
associates and of the Bar. His death is his country's loss, and is
mourned by the great circle of his friends and associates both upon
the bench and at the bar.
"Resolved also, That the Attorney General be asked to present
these resolutions to the Court and to request that they be inscribed
upon its permanent records, and that the chairman of this meeting
be requested to transmit a copy of these resolutions to the family of
the late Justice with an expression of our sincere sympathy in their
bereavement.'
"Justice Sanford's career in the public service had its beginning
in the suggestion by Mr. Justice McReynolds, then an Assistant
Attorney General of the United States, that he be retained by the
Government in the investigation of the Fertilizer Trust in 1905.
The marked ability disclosed in that case secured him immediate
recognition and resulted in his appointment in 1907 to the position
of Assistant Attorney General. While occupying that post he
appeared before this Court on several occasions and make a favorable

MONDAY, JUNE 1, 1931
358
impression by the skill and force with which he presented the cases
entrusted to him. He attracted the favorable attention of President
Roosevelt, and in 1908 was appointed to be United States District
Judge for the Eastern and Middle Districts of Tennessee. He had
hoped to have the post of Solicitor General, and accepted the judicial
office with some reluctance, not realizing that he had been set upon
the path that would lead him to the highest honor open to a member
of his profession.
"During the last forty-five years those appointed United States
District Judges have averaged forty-nine years of age when ap-
pointed. Judge Sanford was forty-three when he became a District
Judge. His case is an example of the gain to the judicial service in
appointing to the lower federal courts comparatively young men, of
character and education, through the opportunities for distinguished
judicial careers thus opened up to them.
"His service as a trial judge was one of exacting labor, rendered
more than usually arduous by a temperament which demanded that
every case be given the most careful and painstaking consideration
regardless of its material importance. While at the bar he had
shown a marked preference for practice before appellate courts, the
quick and undeliberated decisions necessary in trial work being
repugnant to his scholarly and rather cautious nature. For the
same reason his duties as a District Judge were not entirely congenial
to him, since he was constantly faced with the necessity of passing
immediately upon questions to which he would have preferred to
give more mature consideration.
"Nevertheless, his preferences in no way influenced his achieve-
ments, and his record was an enviable one. The high regard in
which he was held by those with whom he was associated was made
evident by the spontaneous outburst of approval with which they
responded to the proposal that he be elevated to the Supreme Court.
When the retirement of Mr. Justice Pitney, on December 1, 1922,
created a vacancy, the Senate of the State of Tennessee adopted a
resolution urging that Judge Sanford be considered for the position,
and the overwhelming indorsement then given him by the people
from his section of the country, coupled with the desire which had
always been his to become a member of an appellate tribunal, must
have made his selection for the supreme bench doubly gratifying to
him.
"
During the seven years of his service as a Justice of the Supreme
Court he delivered the opinion of the Court in 130 cases. These
opinions, which are to be found in volumes 261 to 281, inclusive,
of the Reports, disclose his scholarly training. In addition to his
technical equipment he had that culture and breadth of vision so
valuable in high judicial office. His professional learning was

MONDAY, JUNE 1, 1931
359
supplemented by an intimate familiarity with literature, which gave
to his judicial opinions an unusual clarity and attractive style.
Endowed by nature with the rare gift of felicitous expression, which
he used to such good advantage at the bar, he could not be satisfied
with a judicial utterance until it had been subjected to careful
scrutiny to the end that the exposition of his views and the process
of reasoning upon which they were founded might be full and lucid.
His judicial labors were characterized by patient and conscientious
deliberation upon every aspect of the case in hand. Fidelity to duty
was ever his chief concern.
"His judicial opinions cover most of the branches of the law
with which this Court is called upon to deal. Those in the Pocket
Veto Case in the 279th, and in the Gitlow and Fiske cases in the
268th and 274th, which dealt with the constitutional validity of State
statutes defining criminal anarchy, are examples of the excellence
of his judicial work.
“All of his writings indicate a marked adherence to the principles
on which our Constitution is based, coupled with an appreciation
of the need of adjusting the application of those principles to fit
the requirements of changing conditions. Conservative in judgment
and strict in his adherence to tested doctrines, he was one of that
great body of jurists who have maintained the stability of the
common-law system of jurisprudence.
"No tribute to Justice Sanford, however brief, would be complete
which touched only upon his professional achievements. His early
studies, supplemented by foreign travel, bred in him an enduring
appreciation of music, literature, and the fine arts. He was in every
sense a man of the highest culture. His mastery of the English
language and his training in the field of advocacy combined to
make him a speaker of unusual ability and charm. But above all,
his dominant traits of character were kindliness and affection for
his fellow men. His interests in the fields of education and charity
were many. The joys of friendship were his constant and supreme
delight.
"The widespread grief occasioned by his death was intensified by
the fact that, only sixty-four years of age, his faculties matured by
long experience and untiring industry, he appeared to have many
years of useful service before him. The Nation has lost an able,
high-minded judge, and many of us a gracious friend. Of him it
may fittingly be said, as Campbell said of Lord Holt, "Perhaps the
excellence which he attained may be traced to the passion for justice
by which he was constantly actuated.'
The Chief Justice said:
"Mr. Attorney General, the Court receives with deep gratification
this tribute from the bar to the service of an able and faithful mem-

MONDAY, JUNE 1, 1931
360
ber of this Court, who was taken from us, with tragic suddenness,
in the midst of his career.
"The strength of the Court is the resultant of the interaction and
cooperation of individual forces, and the successful performance of
its function depends upon the discharge of individual responsibility
by Justices of equal authority in the decision of all matters that come
before the Court. It has recruited its strength both from the bar
and from the bench, and the contributions made to the jurispru-
dence of the Court by those whose judgment has been ripened by the
responsibilities of administration in state and federal courts has
been a conspicuous feature of its history.
"Mr. Justice Sanford had the advantage not only of careful prepa-
ration for the bar under the most exacting and stimulating teachers
of the law, and of valuable experience in practice, but of many years
of service as a District Judge of the United States. It was the dis-
tinguished success with which he met that long-continued test that
led to his appointment to this bench. He came here as a graduate
of the hard school of judicial experience, and he brought with him
an intimate and precise knowledge of the problems of the federal
courts. Never sacrificing the dignity, impartiality, and authority of
his office as a District Judge to any desire for public favor, his
ability and fidelity commanded their appropriate and gratifying re-
ward in the esteer and confidence of the community that he served,
so that the bar and the Legislature of the State of Tennessee gave
to the proposal of his appointment to this Court a unanimous indorse-
ment. It was preeminently his judicial quality which won this gen-
eral esteem. Without eccentricity, affectation, or irritation, but with
simplicity, candor, patience, and thoroughness, he had applied him-
self to every judicial task, whether agreeable or irksome, and the
applause which greeted the conduct of his office was a tribute to the
standards of the community as well as to his own.
"In the District Court Judge Sanford carried a heavy burden of
criminal cases, and, as exemplifying his dominant traits, I may
quote what has been said by an eminent member of the bar who
had long observed his manner of discharging this duty: 'In the
administration of the criminal laws he was judge and not prosecu-
tor. The government was only a litigant in his court suing for
Justice. It stood on a parity with the humblest citizen it accused.
The constitution and laws of his country were to be obeyed, and
not evaded, by judge, government, and accused alike.' Especially
prominent in every activity was his unfailing courtesy and grace.
Never lacking this quality himself, he looked for it in others, and
in the District Court under his guidance there was afforded a notable
illustration of the commendable restraint and propriety in speech
16476-31-105

MONDAY, JUNE 1, 1931
361
which heighten rather than impair the effectiveness of forensic
efforts.
"In addition to sound technical training as a lawyer and broad
experience as a judge, Mr. Justice Sanford had resources of cul-
ture, developed by travel and liberal studies both here and abroad.
He was interested in literature, music, and art, and those who en-
joyed companionship with him were not disappointed because of
limitations in his horizon. While the learning of the law was his
supreme interest, it neither monopolized nor narrowed him. He
was happy in his public addresses and brought to many important
meetings the charm of eloquence. The members of the bar can
not fail to remember with especial pleasure his address in London
at the Lord Mayor's dinner at Guild Hall on the occasion of the
visit, in 1924, of the representatives of the American Bar Associa-
tion, and his graceful response to the welcome of the French bench
and bar in the Palais de Justice in Paris. The lawyers and judges
of France had the unusual and welcome opportunity of listening
to an eminent member of the American judiciary paying a
beautiful tribute in their own tongue to their achievements
and aspirations.
"You have alluded, Mr. Attorney General, to the important
opinions delivered for this Court by Mr. Justice Sanford, and, as
illustrating the quality of his work, you have referred in particular
to the Pocket Veto Case (279 U. S. 655) relating to the authority of
the President, and also to the cases in which Mr. Justice Sanford
dealt in clear and definite utterance with the power of the State as
affecting freedom of speech, upholding the necessary authority to
punish abuses of that freedom (Gitlow v. New York, 258 U. S. 652;
Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357) while also sustaining the con-
stitutional limitations which safeguard the liberty of the citizen
(Fiske v. Kansas, 274 U. S. 380). In his work in the District Court
Mr. Justice Sanford had given special attention to the difficult prob-
lems arising in the administration of the bankruptcy law, and he per-
formed a noteworthy service in this Court in that branch of juris-
prudence, writing a number of opinions in leading cases. Meek v.
Centre County Banking Company (268 U. S. 426) and Taylor v.
Voss (271 U. S. 176) are illustrations. Another outstanding judg-
ment delivered by Mr. Justice Sanford was that in Liberty Ware-
house Company v. Grannis (273 U. S. 70) maintaining the essential
limitation of the jurisdiction of the Federal courts to 'cases' and
'controversies.' He reaffirmed with careful emphasis the fundamental
principle, as he expressed it, 'that the judicial power vested by
Article III of the Constitution in this Court and the inferior courts
of the United States established by Congress thereunder, extends

MONDAY, JUNE 1, 1931
362
only to "cases" and "controversies" in which the claims of litigants.
are brought before them for determination by such regular pro-
ceedings as are established for the protection and enforcement of
rights, or the prevention, redress, or punishment of wrongs; and
that their jurisdiction is limited to cases and controversies presented
in such form, with adverse litigants, that the judicial power is
capable of acting upon them, and pronouncing and carrying into
effect a judgment between the parties, and does not extend to the
determination of abstract questions or issues framed for the purpose.
of invoking the advice of the court without real parties or a real
case.'
"
In estimating the value of judicial work, it is well not to lay
too much stress upon opinions which seem to have a particular im-
portance because of the public attention they receive or the spec-
tacular circumstances of the controversies to which they are ad-
dressed. Juristic achievements are not measured by the distinction
of litigants, or the amount in controversy, or the dramatic setting
which gives temporary notoriety. The most worthy performance
of judicial duty in the careful analysis of facts, in exact reasoning,
and in the observance of a correct perspective in bringing the results
of earlier controversies to their appropriate present service, may be
found in cases which attract at the time little attention on the part
of the general public, but achieve importance in the annals of juris-
prudence. The final reputation of a judge owes far less to contem-
porary estimate than to the inevitable later appraisal when his
efforts find their appropriate historical setting.
"Mr. Justice Sanford was keenly aware of this, and, with philo-
sophic bent and conscientious application, he was faithful to the
judicial tradition, devoting the same care to every case which came
before the Court, without regard to its rating in public opinion.
He was ever intent upon the intrinsic quality of his work rather than
upon adventitious circumstance.
"
Although cut off in mid-career, as judicial careers are reckoned,
we gratefully recognize the long service that he rendered in a life
which enjoyed a succession of deserved honors and was crowned
by the fulfillment of a worthy ambition. He met every responsi-
bility with integrity of motive and singleness of purpose, and he
discharged every trust with complete fidelity. His life is epitomized
in his own words: 'Youth and age have come; youth rejoicing in the
splendor of life's morning; and age, steadfast, in the majesty of its
noonday, serene in the tender glow of its evening sky.' In the
midst of that serenity, the final summons came, and he was taken
from us. Mourning our loss, but enriched by the memory of his
friendship and cooperation, we renew our labors."

No. In re Disbarment of William E. Baff. It having been
brought to the attention of the Court that the name of William E.
Baff has been stricken from the roll of attorneys admitted to prac-
tice in the District Court of the United States for the Central Divi-
sion of the Southern District of California, and a notice having issued
to the said William E. Baff, March 23, 1931, to show cause why he
should not be disbarred from the practice of the law in this Court and
his name stricken from the roll of attorneys admitted to practice
here, and the said Baff having filed his response to such notice;
And it having also been brought to the attention of the Court
that the said Baff was disbarred from the practice of the law in the
United States Patent Office on March 18, 1921, upon charges of

MONDAY, JUNE 1, 1931
365
misconduct, and that his application to be re-registered as a member
of the Patent Office Bar was denied upon March 28, 1929, by the
Commissioner of Patents, and that the action of the Commissioner
of Patents in refusing recognition to the said Baff as a patent
attorney was sustained by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court
of the District of Columbia on February 19, 1931;
Now, therefore, it is ordered that the order of the District Court
of the United States for the Southern District of California striking
the name of the said Baff from the roll of attorneys admitted to
practice before that Court; the order of the Commissioner of Patents
disbarring the said Baff from practice as an attorney in the United
States Patent Office, together with his said order refusing Baff
re-registration and the order of the Supreme Court of the District
of Columbia approving such refusal; the notice to show cause issued
by this Court; and the response of the said Baff, with exhibits
thereto, be, and the same are hereby, referred to Mr. Guerney E.
Newlin, of Los Angeles, State of California; to Mr. Warren Olney,
jr., of San Francisco, State of California; and to Mr. Melville Church,
of Washington, District of Columbia, as a committee of the bar of
this Court, to make such inquiry into the matter as may be necessary
or appropriate, and thereupon to make a report and recommendation
